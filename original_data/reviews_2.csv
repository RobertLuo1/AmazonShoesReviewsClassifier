"I love all the KD shoes and have owned several pairs. But, this style has been one of the most comfortable and most therapeutic for my recent but recurring plantar fasciitis (sucks getting old!). Hard to beat the comfort, style, and therapeutic benefits at this price point. And, though I don't play as much round ball as I did in my younger days, these shoes have inspired me to get back out on the court a bit more.",5,1,18
"I've always loved Nike, just not all there styles. These are clean, not overboard.
The seller listed them a bit higher than others, but they didn't have my size. I'm so picky about style I paid the price. ü§™",5,1,18
these shoes are great. I thought they may have been too big at first but nah. they're simple yet cool at the same time. Can def be worn casually.,5,1,18
"I play pickup basketball. I wear ASO ankle guards and these shoes fit perfectly with or without the ankle braces. They have great grip and support, they feel soft and they look great. I'm really impressed!",5,1,18
Hi it was gift to my sons birthday. Even it‚Äôs his size and I got bigger size it‚Äôs not fitting right. Would you please reach me ? We couldn‚Äôt get out health reason to exchange size. Not worn outside.,1,0,18
My son is very athletic he's got basketball starting soon and I needed a shoe that wasn't breaking my bank. He loved them and thought they were acceptable to wear (you know teens) said they had good grip and really worked.,5,1,18
"Perfect size. Very comfortable. Look great.
My husband loves them.",5,1,18

"Great comfort, and long lasting! Great product!
Prompt service from Amazon!",5,1,18
The shoes have great traction and the top of the shoe breathes really well on the top of the foot while running the court.,5,1,18
The picture didn‚Äôt really show how much rainbow type color was on the top part of the shoe. Not worth the expense price unless it‚Äôs perfect. I‚Äôm my opinion anyway!,4,1,18

"Shoes arrived in perfect condition, fit perfectly and are extremely comfortable.
Delivery was actually faster than expected, only negative is they kind of just left them at my door without ringing my doorbell.",5,1,18
Ordered half a size more than I normally wear. nike shoes are usually rather tight. space on the side as well as in length. Stability good. comfortable running and jogging.,4,1,18
" They‚Äôre nice, light weight. They messed my shoe box up in transit though",4,1,18
"I wear size 11 dress shoes and for 30+ years have purchased Nike running shoes one size larger. My size 12 shoes in this model fit very well. But in this particular model, I could go a half-size larger (but half-sizes stop at 12). So, I'm happy, but must wear thin socks. Note: I do remove Nike's sole insert and put one in that's for those who want arch support. But my insert is quite thin and I'd still go with a 12.5 if Nike made it. My width is 11EE:E, so I like the more abundant width of this model.

Very comfortable every-step landing on this shoe on the 4+ mile 4+ MPH walks with my wife. Cushioned landings. Slight space at toe rather than bottom sole extending to the full tip toe - this makes for an encouraged step forward.

One minor downside is the slightly heavier weight, but nowhere near Nike Monarchs anchors. The upside to the weight is I've found Nike shoes over the years that are heavier actually last longer. I'm talking 7-10 years.

Fantastic running shoe for general purpose workouts.",5,1,18
"Bought these as a nice pair to workout in, so I didn‚Äôt expect much...But this is Nike we‚Äôre talking about! Since these shoes even fit better than some running shoes that I‚Äôve tried, I‚Äôve started to wear these with regular outfits. Very glad that I gave these a shot.",5,1,18
"I had a pair of these and wore them out, so I knew how they fit and that I would like them. She provides good stability and is very comfortable. Like the all black color scheme, a must have for work.",5,1,18
"Its true to its size,fits perfect üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩiam very satisfy,i will buy another color soon!üòÉ",5,1,18
"Not the most comfortable shoe, however I do like how structure the shoe is because it seems as though it will keep its shape over time, overall they are great all black shoes.",5,1,18
"They did not arrive in their original box, although in the photo it looks lilac, the shoe is completely black with color, lilac and turquoise. In this air max 200 model you have to buy a size or a half more than what you normally use in Nike sports shoes, on the other hand the shoe is very nice and comfortable",5,1,18
"I own another pair of Nike's Air Max. Very high quality and very comfortable shoes. This one though didn't fit me and is very small, although it's the same size US 10. It's also very stiff and feels like wooden shoes. I don't know if it's an original Nike's or a copy, but I'm disappointed. I would like to return it, but I'm unable to do that right now. Very disappointed with the quality of this product, unable to wear it because it's too small, although it's the same US 10 Nike I bought before for the same model",1,0,18
"Great support, comfortand value for money. Hoping they last for a good year. I use the for running, weight training and bike riding. Strictly indoors in home fitness room. Would like to buy more when on sale.",5,1,18
"I bought these for my husband who walks a lot and he says they‚Äôre very good, stable shoes but they do sound a little loud and clunky when walking in the house on the hardwood floors (our cats even get scared!).",5,1,18
these are good shoes. came really fast and amazing value for only 60$(that's what I paid) so cute and comfortable. they are a little dirty(see picture)in the crevices,4,1,18
That the order came in 2 different sizes for this shoe..is there a way i can jus get a replqcement for the left shoe since its too small of a size for me to where?,3,0,18
Runs a little small.,3,0,18
I purchased these shoes as a gift for someone else. From what I have been told the fit was good and they were comfortable. Other than that I do not know much about these shoes.,4,1,18
Awesome kicks lots of compliments! They do make you about 2 inches taller though. Not a bad thing at all! I‚Äôm 6 ft with these I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2! Great fit and extra comfy walking or running shoe.,5,1,18
"Very comfortable, felt the difference immediately VS. Cheap shoes or other shoes I‚Äôve used or worked out in , completely worth every penny

"Love love love these shoes! They fit my wide feet so perfectly...also, the price isbetter than than retail here in miami.",5,1,18
"These are nice shoes, but they run very small. I read all the prior reviews, in which some said the sizing was great and others commented that the sizes run small. I can confirm that these run small - too small for me to use. And unfortunately I didn't realize that the product was non-returnable. I will stick to walk-in shoe stores from now on.",1,0,18
"I bought these for my husband, he loves them.
He loves the way they look,says they are very comfortable!!",5,1,18
"They appeared to have been worn before, and had some light scuffs on the sides, but cleaned up perfectly. Other than that it's a great shoe,comfortable & lightweight.",3,0,18

I got an 11.5 which is my size and it was too small. My toes where hitting the front and they felt narrow. Sometimes I'm a 12 in some shoes but these were way to small for my liking. Get half a size bigger.,3,0,18

"Fits more snug than expected, but appreciate the support and quality feel.",5,1,18
"They fit perfec, absolutely LOVE THEM will be purchasing again!",5,1,18
When I first put these shoes on they were very stiff. I figured they'd be okay if I broke them in a bit. After four days they are still terrible. After ten minutes of running my feet and shins hurt too badly to continue. I have never had this experience with any other running shoes. I cannot understand how they have any good reviews.,1,0,18
"Definitely uncomfortable, if you have flat feet...",2,0,18

I've returned the sneakers , which were paid off with my AMEX points.
So, when you let me know you have gotten them back, I will order a size 10. And, I want the same points used for the 9.5 to get me the 10's.",2,0,18
Good,5,1,18
"I have worn a size 12 my entire life and while this shoe said it was a size 12, it was too narrow and too short. When I purchase this shoe I am going to a physical store to purchase so that I get the right size. My guess is that a 13 will fit.",3,0,18

Great quality,5,1,18
"These shoes fit perfect, light weight and comfortable. It was delivered faster than normal, the shoes were sealed in a clear see thru bag, no shoe box? Shoes were advertised as brand new, the shoe laces were pre-tied and slightly used with unknown substance on bottom of shoes,",5,1,18

Too small for me. It looks very nice but about the size it doesn't fit well,2,0,18

"After literally walking holes in the bottom of the Nike shoes I received less than a year ago, I was somewhat concerned about buying the Nike brand again. Ultimately, I had heard great things about the Air Max line and, with the price being so affordable, I felt I needed to give my favorite brand another try. So glad that I did! These came quickly and fit perfectly. I've only had them for about 2 weeks but have already walked over 20 miles, worked out aggressively 6 or 7 times, played baseball and basketball and they still look and feel brand new! I am very impressed so far. Time will tell but these, so far, have exceeded my expectations.",5,1,18
Great quality shoes and fit exactly.. Comfortable as you wear them,5,1,18
I needed a black stylish shoe for work. this one fit the bill. very comfortable for a 12 hr shift. however watch out for water; dont know if its because its new but its a little slippery when it comes to water. I did change the laces from the rope type to a flat lace. much better hold there.,5,1,18

"Much prefer these over the Air Max 95, except you cannot get these 200‚Äôs in all-leather.

They‚Äôre very bouncy and comfy. Standard laces and tongue (unlike 95). Feel more sturdy and give better support than the Air Max Plus. They fit wider feet (unlike 95‚Äôs). Although fabric they feel fairly warm on the foot. Yet lightweight.

The small bit of faux leather at the front might take some wear; not sure they‚Äôll stand up to mucking about and kicking a ball etc. Be fine for a gentle jog.

I‚Äôd buy these again if they can as all leather.",4,1,18

"I always buy Nike 10.5 shoes and have been for the past 20 years. These are the first ones in 20 years that are physically smaller. Not sure if there was an error in manufacturing or what but they feel like a size 10 not a size 10.5.

When I lined them up next to two other pairs of Nike's I had, they were visibly smaller. They are tight on the top of my pinky toe as well.",3,0,18
Great shoes. Premium look. The only negative is it‚Äôs too small despite ordering my normal size. Didn‚Äôt fit well. Can I return it and get something bigger? I‚Äôd totally appreciate that.,4,1,18
"Fits great. Great quality, and very clean. Received really fast! ETA of 9/14 - 9/16, but delivered 9/8.",5,1,18
"The shoes are nice but my son doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúwide foot‚Äù yet these are still very slim and hard to get on even after loosening the shoe strings. He did eventually get them on and they didn‚Äôt hurt once on. Otherwise, nice shoe.",4,1,18
"Though I like the shoe but the with was way too tight for a US size 11"". Truth be told can't just wear it I will be giving it to my younger brother.",3,0,18

I wasn't satisfied with my purchase.i thought I was paying for authentic nike sneakers.these sneakers are bootleg.this was a waste of my money.,1,0,18
"I had a vintage pair of Nikes from 2007 that finally gave out so I thought I'd buy another similar pair. Sure they are lightweight but, that is because Nike has skimped on material. The soles on my other Nikes had a very grippy sole built for basketball courts. These shoes have a cheaper, harder plastic sole. The leather is thinner and cheaper. Not very cushioned either. I learned my lesson about buying in-store where you can check for quality before shelling out the cash.",3,0,18
Shoe is very nice. How the hell you leave the sensor on the shoe?,4,1,18
Box was in bad condition but at lease the shoes are good.,4,1,18
"Fit well, sharp looking and fast service.....",5,1,18
My son loved them! He's in middle school & gets best dressed often. My little fashion guy. Lucked up & found these much cheaper than the mall.,5,1,18
"I like the shoe a bit, its kind of slim for a 9.5. It‚Äôs comfortable and not too heavy on the foot. Not as comfy as my AF1s but for a Nike shoe under $100 , not bad. A lil disappointed in the boxing but I read the reviews and it seems everyone has poor packaging. Don‚Äôt know if its the seller or Amazon workers not taking care of the boxes. Either way, I hope they fix it.",4,1,18
Received my package a few minutes ago and the box was broken and damaged and held together with a rubber band in the middle. Disappointing!!,2,0,18
When I got the package and opened it the box was damaged badly ripped and smashed. The shoes weren't damaged but on inspecting them on shoe (at the front toe area) is wrinkled all the way around like it was glued back on unprofessionally. My first purchase every on here that I'm not happy with. And I purchase a lot of shoes on here. This is the first time this has happened where I'm not happy with what I got. AND THEY WERE FOR MY BIRTHDAY!!,2,0,18
The packages came on time and they fit perfectly but the shoes have definitely been worn before. They were nice and clean in some areas but then I found a lot of scuffs like someone wore them one time and decided to sell them. Not cool.,3,0,18

"I bought these for my 16 year old son and he really likes how they look but he said they're a bit tight on the sides. They're size 10.5, which is his usual size, so I'm not sure if the shoes just run narrow or what.

Also, I had the same issue with poor packaging and other reviewers. The shoes weren't damaged at all but the box was in poor condition when I received it.",3,0,18
"I love these shoes but, I wish I could have gotten a wider width",4,1,18

I like the style of the sneakers easy to wipe off. I wear them for work I'm on my feet and on the go all the time. I was a disappointed that they were not as comfortable as I expected. Thinking about getting some inserts. The price was reasonable. I might purchase another pair.,4,1,18

The box that the shoes came in was pretty badly damaged which is why I took away a star cuz it was supposed to be a Christmas gift and I hate having to give it to the person in a banged up box but the shoes look very good and don't look used or in back condition so I'll be keeping them,4,1,18
My 13 year old so picked these out online and loves them. We went to several stores looking for sneakers and couldn‚Äôt find any he liked. These fit well and look great. I like that they‚Äôre leather and will most likely last longer than others he‚Äôs had with nylon covering.,5,1,18

Excellent LTD 3's . Fit really nice and look great with jeans and shorts. Great for running or walking. I use a pair for work and have a new pair to go out. Have gotten a lot of compliments wearing them from friends asking me where I got them and if I can get them some too. These shoes are easy to clean and last a real long time and still going strong. These look great for both men and women. I will keep buying these in the future. Highly recommend.,5,1,18
Great looking shoe. Immediate compliments. Was a little worried by the reviews and was half expecting fakes but they seem legit to me. For the price I paid they better be! A little snug for us wide foots but not too much. Also the insoles a little stiff but I can still walk comfortably in them and would def recommend. Will be back to update on endurance over time.,4,1,18
Besides the box looking bad. The shoes are comfortable and fits perfectly.,5,1,18
"I purchased these shoes and my excitement was quickly turned to disappointment. When spending you know $100+ on a new pair of shoes, you expect the shoes to be you know, new. They were shipped shortly after purchasing, and arrived in a timely manner, that was great. What wasn‚Äôt great, was taking them out of the package and getting ready to wear them, and upon initial inspection seeing that the shoes looked worn, had scuff marks, minor creasing, smudges, scratches and some weird red stuff on the top of the toes. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed and very unsatisfied with that.",3,0,18
"I loved the look of these shoes on amazon and they are airmax so I bought them. After wearing them two times my ankles started to hurt and my feet felt tired. The air bubble seems like its so hard that it makes your legs, feet and knees ache. Also they are full grain leather and they make noise when you are walking around that gets annoying. I sent them back and bought two new pairs for the price of the airmax and they are way more comfortable!",1,0,18
"I ORDERED THESE SHOES BECAUSE THEY ARE ONE OF THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHOES I HAVE EVER WORN SOME YEARS AGO, AND I ALWAYS SWORE I WOULD GET ANOTHER PAIR. I FINALLY SPLURGED ON MYSELF AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE. THE STITCHING IS PERFECT, THE ENTIRE SHOES IS FLAWLESS.",5,1,18
Usual size purchased is 13. This Nike was 13?but tight and hard. Should have larger or wider sizes for NIKE. Therefore this expensive shoe is a waste. As I said and scratchers aree always better fit,1,0,18
What a mistake. Looks great but the fit and comfort are terrible.,1,0,18
Great sneakers. These are my favorite sneakers and was happy to see that I could buy them here. It‚Äôs very hard to find these in stores and I was happy to buy them.,5,1,18

"I don't run. I was just looking for a comfortable walking shoe. These do the job. Not too tight. I was disappointed in that the inner sole was not very cushioned. If I were buying these to run I would be disappointed, but for walking they are fine.",4,1,18
"Everything I wanted, I love it and most beautiful girls out there will love it",5,1,18
Both shoes had a permanent crease even though they didn't look worn.,1,0,18
These are my work shoes--I am a letter carrier. I tried to go with a different Nike style but came back to these. They give me the comfort and support I need!,5,1,18
I like the shoes they are comfortable. I did notice minor cosmetic issue like small piece of leather not being cut away around the stitching and an indentation around the toe area. I kinda wish they used rubber instead of black foam type material around the sole,4,1,18
Bought these as a gift for my adult son. Exactly what he wanted. Nice tennis shoes!,5,1,18

Ok these shoes look just like the pic.. I wear a size 11 in asics. Only shoes i hv worn in the past 10 yrs. anyways these nikes are a little narrow. So if they hv a size m. I would recomend. Also these shoes are going to take some time breaking in. Very very stiff shoe. Ince they are broke in im shure ivwill love them. I wore first day all over chicago. Yea my feet were killing me. Not from walking just from shoe being so stiff. I hv decided winter is not a good tym to break these leather shoes in. Over all this is a very nice shoe,4,1,18

"I do like these shoes and do wear them. The only downside is that shoes, and specifically the tongue of the shoe, are very stiff.

"I decided to pickup some legendary Nike Air Max and I've not been disappointed. These are well made, a good size and feel premium on my feet.

Pros
Well made
Nice material
Good cusioning
No blisters.
Look awesome

Cons
Can't think of any

Overall these are as expected and well worth the purchase.",5,1,18
"I have wider than 'average' feet, so that rules me out of all Adidas products, Reebok used to be ok in the 90's but they changed their 'Last' (which is the foot shape that the designs are based on) for something narrower and sadly none will fit now. If you go up a size it helps for width but then you get clown shoes with a huge gap from the toe to the end of the shoe which make them impossible to drive in.
Nike have always been a good fit, since the mid 90's I have always stayed with Nike but this shoe crippled me! So much narrower than any I have tried on, but I thought it might have been just tight leather and they would break in. Sadly not but now too late to return, my advice is if they don't feel right as soon as you put them on, send them back.",5,1,18
I have these is more of a fabric in a few colours but theses come up massive in the same size compared to my others. Worn a few times so I can‚Äôt send them back which I should have. They will be in the cupboard until I can bare to give them away as only wore a few times.,5,1,18
"No complaints on the shoe, its exactly as the description. My only qualm is that delivery was crap as it never arrived and i had to hunt it down",3,0,18
This was the Nike shoe box inside the packaging as this was a Xmas present I am not impressed what kind of company sends this to a customer also one trainer had dirty marks on it that I had to clean if this wasn‚Äôt for a Xmas present they would have been on a plane back to Germany looks like they came from a Nike clearance shop will give this company a miss in the future.,3,0,18
My son was advised by podiatrist to buy trainers with a good heel and strong back and sides due to foot problems low arches and flat feet. Our local shop did not have them in size 10.5 so had to search the internet. The services was great and the product genuine and good quality. He is walking better with less discomfort.,4,1,18

Excellent LTD 3's . Fit really nice and look great with jeans and shorts. Great for running or walking. I use a pair for work and have a new pair to go out. Have gotten a lot of compliments wearing them from friends asking me where I got them and if I can get them some too. These shoes are easy to clean and last a real long time and still going strong. These look great for both men and women. I will keep buying these in the future. Highly recommend.,5,1,18
Great looking shoe. Immediate compliments. Was a little worried by the reviews and was half expecting fakes but they seem legit to me. For the price I paid they better be! A little snug for us wide foots but not too much. Also the insoles a little stiff but I can still walk comfortably in them and would def recommend. Will be back to update on endurance over time.,4,1,18
Besides the box looking bad. The shoes are comfortable and fits perfectly.,5,1,18
"I purchased these shoes and my excitement was quickly turned to disappointment. When spending you know $100+ on a new pair of shoes, you expect the shoes to be you know, new. They were shipped shortly after purchasing, and arrived in a timely manner, that was great. What wasn‚Äôt great, was taking them out of the package and getting ready to wear them, and upon initial inspection seeing that the shoes looked worn, had scuff marks, minor creasing, smudges, scratches and some weird red stuff on the top of the toes. I‚Äôm pretty disappointed and very unsatisfied with that.",3,0,18
"I loved the look of these shoes on amazon and they are airmax so I bought them. After wearing them two times my ankles started to hurt and my feet felt tired. The air bubble seems like its so hard that it makes your legs, feet and knees ache. Also they are full grain leather and they make noise when you are walking around that gets annoying. I sent them back and bought two new pairs for the price of the airmax and they are way more comfortable!",1,0,18
"I ORDERED THESE SHOES BECAUSE THEY ARE ONE OF THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHOES I HAVE EVER WORN SOME YEARS AGO, AND I ALWAYS SWORE I WOULD GET ANOTHER PAIR. I FINALLY SPLURGED ON MYSELF AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE. THE STITCHING IS PERFECT, THE ENTIRE SHOES IS FLAWLESS.",5,1,18
Usual size purchased is 13. This Nike was 13?but tight and hard. Should have larger or wider sizes for NIKE. Therefore this expensive shoe is a waste. As I said and scratchers aree always better fit,1,0,18

"I don't run. I was just looking for a comfortable walking shoe. These do the job. Not too tight. I was disappointed in that the inner sole was not very cushioned. If I were buying these to run I would be disappointed, but for walking they are fine.",4,1,18
"Everything I wanted, I love it and most beautiful girls out there will love it",5,1,18

These are my work shoes--I am a letter carrier. I tried to go with a different Nike style but came back to these. They give me the comfort and support I need!,5,1,18
I like the shoes they are comfortable. I did notice minor cosmetic issue like small piece of leather not being cut away around the stitching and an indentation around the toe area. I kinda wish they used rubber instead of black foam type material around the sole,4,1,18

Ok these shoes look just like the pic.. I wear a size 11 in asics. Only shoes i hv worn in the past 10 yrs. anyways these nikes are a little narrow. So if they hv a size m. I would recomend. Also these shoes are going to take some time breaking in. Very very stiff shoe. Ince they are broke in im shure ivwill love them. I wore first day all over chicago. Yea my feet were killing me. Not from walking just from shoe being so stiff. I hv decided winter is not a good tym to break these leather shoes in. Over all this is a very nice shoe,4,1,18

"I decided to pickup some legendary Nike Air Max and I've not been disappointed. These are well made, a good size and feel premium on my feet.

Pros
Well made
Nice material
Good cusioning
No blisters.
Look awesome

Cons
Can't think of any

Overall these are as expected and well worth the purchase.",5,1,18
"I have wider than 'average' feet, so that rules me out of all Adidas products, Reebok used to be ok in the 90's but they changed their 'Last' (which is the foot shape that the designs are based on) for something narrower and sadly none will fit now. If you go up a size it helps for width but then you get clown shoes with a huge gap from the toe to the end of the shoe which make them impossible to drive in.
Nike have always been a good fit, since the mid 90's I have always stayed with Nike but this shoe crippled me! So much narrower than any I have tried on, but I thought it might have been just tight leather and they would break in. Sadly not but now too late to return, my advice is if they don't feel right as soon as you put them on, send them back.",5,1,18
I have these is more of a fabric in a few colours but theses come up massive in the same size compared to my others. Worn a few times so I can‚Äôt send them back which I should have. They will be in the cupboard until I can bare to give them away as only wore a few times.,5,1,18
"No complaints on the shoe, its exactly as the description. My only qualm is that delivery was crap as it never arrived and i had to hunt it down",3,0,18
This was the Nike shoe box inside the packaging as this was a Xmas present I am not impressed what kind of company sends this to a customer also one trainer had dirty marks on it that I had to clean if this wasn‚Äôt for a Xmas present they would have been on a plane back to Germany looks like they came from a Nike clearance shop will give this company a miss in the future.,3,0,18
My son was advised by podiatrist to buy trainers with a good heel and strong back and sides due to foot problems low arches and flat feet. Our local shop did not have them in size 10.5 so had to search the internet. The services was great and the product genuine and good quality. He is walking better with less discomfort.,4,1,18

"Great sneaker. Very comfortable, lightweight and great for being on your feet all day. Practically feels like you're just wearing socks on the top and sides of your foot and the foam in the sole is very supportive and cushy. Looks even better when you're wearing them than it does without a foot inside in the product photos. I bought a pair for myself for an all day, early morning to late evening event which required me to walk and stand the entire day, and amazingly, my feet didn't hurt at all at the end of the day or the next day. They're now my everyday shoe and they're so comfy that I bought this pair in a different colorway for my boyfriend who is on his feet all day at work.",5,1,18
"Have gout and a somewhat flat foot. I also do not like when my toe jams into the rubber part of the front of all other shoes I have. I have really nice Asics Gel Kayanos and would have sworn they were the most comfortable shoes. The only issue is the support around the front sometimes cramps my toes in. When I put these Nike Tanjuns on, I discovered the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. The entire front of the shoe is loose fabric and the sole is a flat memory foam material. Feels like I am wearing a super comfortable sock. I have now purchased 5 pairs of these shoes in different colors. I am the type of person who will buy as many of something as I can if I am worried the style or feel will change in the future. That being said, I will wear my Asics for extreme sporting activities and the Tanjuns for everything else.",5,1,18
"Ordered a Nike, got a ??? Cheap foam insert does not even go to the end of the shoe. The Nike symbol is not there at all. Poorly made in China. Thank goodness we used amazon prime and will be returning it today.",1,0,18
"I have purchased many pairs of sneakers over the years, but the Nike Tanjun Running Sneaker literally has been the only pair I've owned that has checked all the boxes. They are light weight, super comfortable, stylish, durable, and fit perfectly. I have worn them almost daily for months now and they still look as good as the day I bought them. I highly recommend these sneakers!",5,1,18
"I've done and am still doing research on shoes. I have plantar fasciitis and need a cushioned shoe. This is definitely not it. I'm not sure what's going on with the reviews and/or the claims by the company, but these shoes have a cheap 2mm foam insert on top of an extremely hard outsole. This thing does not give at all. I tried these shoes on for 15 minutes and couldn't stand the pain.

These may be great for stability, I don't know. They're definitely not comfortable or cushioned at all.",1,0,18
"It's a quality shoe, I'll give it that. Can't go wrong with Nike, but it's not as comfortable as I was hoping from reviews. I stand and walk on hard concrete floors 9 hours a day, very little relaxing. By the end of my day my knees are killing me, and my feet ache. Well, my old shoes were ok for that, made a heck of a difference with dr shoals insoles. But these shoes don't feel any better, they might actually be a bit more uncomfortable at days end. The white sole is also filthy after only a week walking around, so not the best for a dirty environment, but what shoe is...
At least their new and free of holes.üòä",3,0,18
I work 80 hours a week. I am going to put these shoes to the test. This is my second pair and I must say these shoes can take a beating. I have foot problems but these shoes help with the pain. I stay on my feet all day and I recommend them Comfortable and lightweight.,5,1,18
Extremely lightweight and breathable sneakers. Very comfortable. They do need to be broken in by wear but that doesn't take long at all. Size ran normal for me also. Great sneakers.,5,1,18
Really comfortable. Lightweight too. Really nothing wrong with them from what i can tell,5,1,18
"I‚Äôve been wearing these shoes very regularly for about 14 months. Here‚Äôs the short:

Pros: These are pretty comfortable and good if you‚Äôre on your feet all day and want shoes that can assist in delaying heel pain.

Cons: The tread is GONE. I‚Äôve found myself slipping and sliding for a few months to the point that it‚Äôs time to retire these permanently. I‚Äôd keep wearing if the tread lasted longer, but it just hasn‚Äôt help up even to relatively light use after one year.

Conclusion: Worth it, but look for a sale, because they probably won‚Äôt last as long as you‚Äôd like.",4,1,18
"I ordered a pair of these size 8 wide. What came were a used pair, size 8. The box wasn‚Äôt new and said size 8. The person who put stickers on the box covering where it‚Äôs marked size 8 with stickers that say say size 8 wide. The sneakers I paid for were supposed to be brand new. They weren‚Äôt. The left sneaker was incorrectly relaced. The bottom of the sneaker was worn down. For the money I paid I expect, no I demand brand new, quality product, not sneakily refurbished trash.",1,0,18
"These shoes do not hold up, I wore through the tread in 3 weeks. The cushion has broken down and they are uncomfortable to walk in now. If you walk on a wet surface use caution.",1,0,18
"If you need to get new tennis shoes I can not recommend this pair enough. They are my favorite sneaker of all time. I'm seriously debating if I should get another 'back up' pair in case Nike stops making them down the road so I will have another pair when I wear these out. I got them bc I have to start wearing some custom orthotics daily due to collapsed arches and I liked these b/c you can 'dress' them up a little bit for sneakers. But they are so light, breathable and like walking on a very supportive cloud if that makes sense. The mesh is flexible so it will accommodate bunions too if you have them (they stretch out for my orthotics nicely). I show up for happy hours in them and ppl say outfits are 'cute' so they really do the dress up role nicely. I'm so happy with them. I got a men's size - I'm a 9 in women's and ordered an 8 men's and they fit perfect.",5,1,18
The shoes are fine but the fact that they were already worn was upsetting. See photos. The bottoms are obviously worn and dirty. Not sure how they passed any product inspections at Amazon. Box was very damaged as well.,1,0,18
"I seem to have problems with my feet and with heart issues was asked by my doctor to walk every day. Bought the Royal Blue first pair of Nike. After having tried 3 to 4 different brands and not being satisfied bought my second White and by 3rd Black pair. The shoe feels very comfortable in the toes and on my heels as well, can walk for an extended amount of time with no pain no issues. Trust me these are the most comfortable pair of walking shoes I have had. If you look for comfort you will pick these.",5,1,18
I've owned Nike shoes in the past but for some reason these shoes are just okay. I really can't put my finger on it but something just seems to be off pudding about these certain shoes. I guess over all they're okay but they just seem to have a cheap feel to them and they don't seem to fit as well as other Nike shoes I've owned. In closing all I can really say is if you're buying a pair of Nike shoes don't go cheap just lay out some cash and give your feet a true treat.,3,0,18
"I have flat feet, and finding a comfortable walking/running shoe is extremely difficult. My job requires a LOT of walking several hours a day, and these feel like I‚Äôm wearing socks! Incredibly soft and comfortable, and I can walk all day in my flat feet. I was so impressed with these that after just 3 days I ordered another pair in a different color.

If you have flat feet like me, you will absolutely LOVE these!",5,1,18
"When I first put these on they were a bit tight but figured they'd stretch a bit. They did not, while they were ok in the toe area, the width was very snug. My main issue with the shoe was that for all the apparent cushioning, there is actually very little once you put them on. It is a very, very firm shoe with little to no arch support, I could feel myself standing on my heals.

The mesh of the upper is very nice and does ventilate well. If you will be doing a reasonable amount of standing or walking, these are not the shoes to wear. I wear a standard width size 10 for the last 30+ years, these are on the snug side.",2,0,18
"I have ankle pain from standing for 24+ hours in the ICU rounding (also have excessive eversion of my feet and some peroneal tendonitis from a tennis injury). I had tried compression socks and wearing an AFO brace to help. These helped some but since switching to these shoes 2 months ago...my pain is practically gone. I probably just needed to replace my older new balances (worn for 12 months) but still....very happy with this shoe thus far. Light weight, breathable, and not too expensive. Im in the NICU so unlikely to get major spills so I didn't really care about water resistance.",5,1,18
These are the most comfortable sneakers I've ever worn. I've worn plenty of Asics and even Brooks shoes because I figured a great running shoe would be a great walking shoe but it turns out I was wrong. These are the best walking shoes I've ever worn. The mesh is extra breathable so your feet stay dryer and the shoes won't smell bad as quickly. The cushion provided by these shoes is fantastic. I think there is something to the flat bottom shoes because Asics always have a recess on the bottom so your heel won't hit the ground. I think this actually causes my ankle to pronate and is generally a less comfortable design. It's also worth noting that I have a slightly wide and flatter foot and these are still a great fit. Overall great pair of shoes and I'd highly recommend them.,5,1,18
"I have NO idea how it got so many 5 stars. Probably from sponsors, paid people or amateur sneakerheads. The quality is of a sweat factory that costs $1.50 for sale to make. It's an absolute rip off and the gums are too high. Go to the mall and buy a better quality pair. Not even the outlets have it this bad. Clearance product.",1,0,18
"These were kind of narrow and hurt my feet until like the 6th time I wore them... Then again I have wide feet, so that could be part of the issue.
Also the toe started separating from the front of the shoe like the 4th time I wore them,, so I was not happy about that.. Bought nikes before in the past, and never had the issue.
Love the all black tho!!",5,1,18
"Last year I ordered these exact same sneakers. The fit and comfort was perfect. I loved them and, therefore, I ordered another pair this summer. I was disappointed with the new pair. The new pair is smaller and tighter although it is the exact same size, 9.5, as the older ones. What I noticed on the label is that last year's pair was made in Indonesia. This year's pair is made in Vietnam. Nike's specs shrunk in the process. If in doubt, order larger.",3,0,18
"I love these for running and day to day wear. So comfy, I love the sleek minimalist style, no gawdy colors or design, and they breathe! I plan on buying more (colors) of these as long as Nike makes them. $70 feels a little steep for how light these are, but hey... It's Nike. Only downside is that the material is tough to clean, so maybe avoid white.",5,1,18
"I spend long hours on my feet and was in constant pain with my old shoes, despite the fact that they had claimed to be good for just those sort of conditions. After two months of wearing these ones, I have no pain at all. When I first put them on, they felt great, but I still had the residual pain from before, so I couldn't really tell how these would pan out. It took a while for my feet to heal but now all the pain in my arches and toes is gone, so I would highly recommend these to anyone suffering from foot pain due to long hours of standing and walking and also to anyone who has to work under those conditions and wants to avoid pain. Plus they look great. (I got the blue ones.)",5,1,18
"Bad photo but yeah I love these, all I buy is Nike really, I really really wish they were like the Nike Roshe, I thought they were the same thing but the netting is not as breathable(still breathable though) and the insole is a part of the shoe also not as nice as the Roshe. But overall the shoe is nicer.",5,1,18
"I bought this shoe because it was listed as one of the top shoes to buy for people on their feet all day, plus some of the reviews here said it's a great shoe for that purpose. I work in a warehouse, ten hour shifts. I spent a lot of money, expecting that these shoes would deliver. By the time I get home from work every day, I can barely walk anymore, so I was hoping to find a pair of shoes that would alleviate my foot pain. I wore these the first day and was disappointed that they did not deliver like so many other people said. After only a few hours on my feet, I was back to being in pain and found no difference from wearing these shoes than any other shoe.",2,0,18
"This shoe is my second choice in footwear. Payless Shoe Store, now closed, had great, inexpensive mesh shoes. After they closed, I was adrift trying to find comfortable shoes that really fit. Even buying in shoe stores did not work. I wasted a lot of money. Fortunately, I discovered Tanjun Nike Mesh Shoes. They fit right size and are comfortable. I hope they stay in production.",4,1,18
"I‚Äôm a painting contractor and on my feet all day, so when I googled top 10 most comfortable shoes, these were #1 with Adidas cloudfoam ultimate #2 (or visa versa). Then I found these here on AMZN, and after reading all the excellent reviews about them, I decided to purchase. Well, I wear a size 11, so I ordered a pair of cloudfoam ultimates and a pair of these in my size, but these are too short. My big toe is about to bust through the fabric when walking around my house for 5 min. So I‚Äôm returning and because they don‚Äôt have an 11-1/2 available in the color I want, I purchased another pair of cloudfoam ultimates. With that being said, these shoes are extremely comfortable and lightweight. Almost can‚Äôt even tell I‚Äôm wearing shoes. If they had a half size larger, I would have exchanged for a pair that fit.",4,1,18
"The shoe was white and black and quality doesn't seem good, no point in returning it as there is no guarantee I will get a different one.",1,0,18
"I expected $60 Nike brand shoes to last longer than 2 months. Just after the return window closed, a huge hole appeared in the toe. These shoes were worn for every day walking around, not for sports or anything rough. I‚Äôd give 0 stars if I could. DISAPPOINTED!",1,0,18
"IMO this is Nike's best running shoe, if not their best shoe they made ever. It's comfortable, lightweight, and smooth which is what I look for in a shoe. It is almost the perfect shoe ever, except for one thing. It will not protect your feet from getting wet in the rain or snow. This shoe is much better in the gym or warm weather, but if that doesn't faze you, like it didn't faze me, than get this shoe.",5,1,18
"These are nice shoes! I will say from past experience, that Nike shoe sizes do run small. I normally wear a 10 1/2, but with Nike I wear an 11 1/2. I bought 11 1/2 and they fit perfectly and they are very comfortable. Hard to find basic black and white shoes anymore. Everything is either neon orange or some other crazy color. I do recommend these shoes though. Just be carefull about the size you order.",5,1,18
"The shoes I purchased were marketed and bought under the label and description that they were men‚Äôs shoes. I got them and jammed them on my feet and they‚Äôve crushed my feet. At first I thought I just needed to break them in but realized they are not men‚Äôs as I had been promised as those I purchased. I have 3 pair of these in men‚Äôs and they are as comfortable as anything so I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. I would like my money back please and/or possible, they be replaced with a size 10.5 men‚Äôs version of these sneakers. Very upsetting.",1,0,18
"So, I had actually bought the same pair of shoes 4 years back. They lasted me 3 years and were perfect for everything, from working at my warehouse job, to hiking, and running. Can't wait for these pair to last me a while as well. These are very comfortable and durable shoes, highly recommend these to anyone looking for THAT shoe, this is THE ONE. Whether it be, casual wear, sport, work, this is your GO TO shoe. Looking forward to making more memories with these pair of shoes.",5,1,18
"Bought a pair of these shoes earlier this year. I've worn them almost daily for months now and have never liked a pair of shoes better. Lightweight yet sturdy and fairly good looking. I had to purchase a backup pair, because I know I'll wear my current pair out someday.",5,1,18
"My new favorite pair of shoes. Got these for 55 on Friday and they were at my door on Sunday. I'm pretty sure these are the casual/walking shoes I'll be wearing from now on. I'll save my Air Force Ones for those special occasions. They also give you a good amount of lift. Super clean black, I'm just hoping I don't get the white part dirty too quickly",5,1,18
"Loved these shoes, bought them last year for my teenage son..however don‚Äôt have them yet..Amazon delivery delayed...so frustrating and disappointed.
Shows good
Delivery blah
Hopefully they show up soon",1,0,18
"I absolutely love these shoes. Man are they comfortable. Probably the most comfortable shoes I‚Äôve ever owned. This was the second pair I bought. BUT I keep having the same issues with them. After 3-4 months a hole always appears in the area where my big toes are. I saw another review just now talking about the same thing. I got them for $40 and I see they‚Äôve gone up to almost $100. I didn‚Äôt mind buying a second pair because of the price, but for $100 I would never. Not for the poor quality.",3,0,18
Do not buy this garbage! It last 3 months. Then the front top starts to rip up! Very not lasting material. DON‚ÄôT waste your money,1,0,18
My son loves these shoes. He‚Äôs a young boy so he is constantly growing. And he likes to run and play basketball. He wears out a pair of shoes pretty fast. He has had 3 pairs of this exact shoe for the last two years. We did change shoes once for another pair of Nikes but he ended up with heel pain and some mild plantar fasciitis. We stopped wearing those shoes and went back to these. He now has no foot pain. This seems to be a great shoe that supports the heels and arches.,5,1,18
Tanjun are the worst sneaker so far in Nike history in my household . Bought them july 11th and they are in the trash already. Poorly made wore out the tread already plus the side of the shoe material got a stretched shredded spot in the material . Not the toe part in the ankle area. Money wasted.,1,0,18
"These shoes are very lightweight and comfortable. I got a men's size 10, and they don't seem quite as large as that, but still fit ok. Love the color - very deep, rich black.",5,1,18
Do NOT buy. My son has work Nike all his life and we usually love them. He has work them about 4-5 times and there is a hole already in the top mesh area. Very disappointed. I rarely write a review but felt it would be helpful to others.,1,0,18
"Great looking sneaker and comfortable but I had to exchange for a half size larger because it runs a little tight and narrow. Once I got the larger size, it fits perfectly and feels pretty sturdy for running, gym and everyday walking",5,1,18
"First these came and they were too tight, tried to wear them for a while anyway and got a hole in them, fell apart, very disappointed in Nike",2,0,18
"These sneakers are very comfortable and very lightweight. Third pair I've purchased. Have them in white, black, and now gray. All were different prices. Go figure !!!!!!!",5,1,18
"I wear sneakers pretty much all day every day year round, and this type of shoe is very comfortable. I have owned and worn these shoes in the past(four pairs so far), and will probably continue to buy them in the future/",5,1,18
I love these sneakers! I have them in several different colors because they are so comfortable and help my painful feet feel better. Love them!,5,1,18
"Love these shoes for daily use. Comfy. Goes with anything. Just wish the fabric cover over the insert was glued into place better. Mine started to slowly loosen up until it came out completely. Have had a few of these shoes and it happens after 2 months of wearing them. Not a big deal since they are so cheap, and inserts are cheap to buy.",5,1,18
These are nice looking Nike‚Äôs at a good value. Delivery was delayed and it was never advised why but I am satisfied with my purchase totally,5,1,18
"Never been a Nike shoe fan but wanted to give these shoes a try since its on Google's Top 10 most comfortable shoes list and voted #2. Wanted something comfortable to wear for work since my job requires more than half of my day standing and walking around. I'd say these are nice to wear but #2 most comfortable shoes, nahh! Find something else. They look nice though, thats a plus.",4,1,18
"I have a big foot (size 11 women's shoe). I purchased the black pair in a men's size 10, they are alittle bit wider in the toe area whereas a women's shoe fits tight and a wide is too wide. Very comfortable so I found these online and ordered them in white.",5,1,18
"Very comfortable and I only just got them so I can't comment on the durability, but even though I ordered a half size larger than the sizing chart indicated, the fit is very snug in the toes, three of which are visibly protruding against the tip of the toe box. If not for the give in the fabric, I would return them. I'll keep them and just order a full size larger next time.",4,1,18
"These shoes are incredibly comfortable to wear, but after simple everyday use, the traction on the bottom got worn down very quickly. I've had them just over 6 months and the shoes now have zero traction (it's like I'm wearing socks ‚Äìas far as traction goes) and I need to buy a new pair of shoes.",2,0,18
The box arrived crushed with rubber bands keeping it closed. I didn't even bother open the box. I can only imagine the condition the shoes were in.,1,0,18
"This is not a high end shoe, but it does work for me since I use it primarily for walking. It could have higher arch support, but fits according to expectations. Good value.",4,1,18
"I wear them for running and they feel very comfortable. For the price they are very worth it. It is very bare bones so know that going in. If you want all the bells and whistles that seem to come with shoes these days, you're going to have to pay for it.

This is a pair of shoes that will support, stay on your feet, and feel comfortable. Thats it.",5,1,18
"I got these shoes for a birthday present. The birthday has not yet occurred, so I cannot answer if the recipient was pleased, etc. Sorry I'm not more help. They look nice in the box....",3,0,18
"I bought these for my son, who runs track for his local high school. He reports that they fit just great and he could not be happier. They seem to be well built and not too expensive, so I would say they are a good value for the money.",5,1,18
"I had these shoes for less than a month. I put 48 walking miles on them at which time there was not any tread on the sole. Either the shoes were defective, used because there was hardly any tread when I received them or a knock off. Never buy shoes online from this vendor or Amazon.",1,0,18
"This sneakers literally traveled with me around the world, I have been using them every single day since July 2019 and still going. The materials are of a good quality and also light, very easy to dry if it gets wet. I am just waiting to get my second pair but as the things are going it will take a long time before.",5,1,18
I love Nike athletic shoes. I really like this particular style. It is light-weight & very comfortable. It provides support but doesn't feel too restrictive. The body of the shoe breathes so my feet stay cool. Great shoe!,5,1,18
"I almost never bother to leave reviews, but these were good enough for me to write one. I have very flat feet, and need a lot of arch support, so I have been a repeat Nike customer for many years now. I often get knee and/or foot pain from formal shoes, so I was also looking for running shoes that look nice enough to be acceptable in a business casual office environment. These fit the bill perfectly on both counts.

Bonus for being the lightest sneakers I have ever bought.",5,1,18
"These shoes were great and very comfortable, however they only lasted 5 months before a hole appeared in the top of the shoe. Additionally, the netting at the front of the shoe began to come loose from the rubber sole at the tip of the shoe. Pretty disappointing, as these shoes are very lightweight and comfortable. For reference, I wore them to the gym (2-3x a week) and whenever doing any time of physical activity outside.",3,0,18
"True Size 9, 4E are not easy to find, especially in a reasonable looking style. Quite comfortable as well.",5,1,18
These shoes are so amazing! I bought this pair for my boyfriend to wear when he works out. Love the way he looks wearing them when he wears them with out socks. GIGGITY!,5,1,18
A lot of reviews said they were getting fake ones. These seem very real and are amazing. these are nike running shoes and are amazing like they always are.,5,1,18
In my 80s but active and I need a comfortable shoe with support and it's great if it looks good at the same time. This does all of that.,5,1,18
I bought this shoe because I needed a walking sneaker. I did some Google searches and this sneaker was highly recommended. Its a very lightweight shoe with great cushioning.,5,1,18
These are the lightest sneakers I've ever owned. I got them to do a lot of standing. Very comfortable. I had to return the first pair for the next smaller size. (Free return. No problems) Usually take a 9.5. In these had to take a 9.0.,5,1,18
Will never buy from this seller again ! Shoes fell apart after 60 days with very little wear ! Horrible customer service,5,1,18
Great shoe. Just the right weight for casual walking. I just bought him a second pair,4,1,18
"Got it for my son. Good fit, but the sole is bad. Lost the entire sole grip, it smoothened out after a few hoops on driveway basketball ring. It lasted about 2 weeks at best. My son weighed about 120 pounds",2,0,18
"They are so light, it feels like wearing a pair of socks. Very comfortable; the look good enough to be able to wear with business casual clothing.

I'd imagine that they can't last too long since they are so lightly constructed, but even if that is so, their price-point makes it worth it for the comfort and fit.",5,1,18
I bought these same shoes but in a different color at Fred Meyer 6 months ago in a size 12 and were awesome. Bought them online in a different color but same size and they are too small. Not sure why that is. Order size bigger if this is the case,3,0,18
"As pictured the shoes came with yellow
Staining on toe of both shoes.
The shoe is otherwise great
Just a bad glue job on shoe that made it through insprction and to a custimer.",3,0,18
Third pair I bought these sneakers are like wearing slippers almost! I ordered a 4th which comes tomorrow or Thursday in case they stop making them!,5,1,18
I originally ordered 7.5 for my wife as a surprise but they were small so I returned it to get 8.5. The new order came in and it's a 7.5 again.... now I have to return it again and I hope this time the order is right.,1,0,18
Great option for summer months! Lightweight and really comfortable!,5,1,18
"The shoe soles wear out in just two months, normal workout use. Smooth as a baby face. Unlike",2,0,18
Got just as expected and are great feeling on my feet. They have all day comfort being as I am a student and I walk 3 miles a day to get to and from school,5,1,18
These sneakers have changed horrendously. They will destroy your feet. I tossed mine in the trash can before they could do any more damage.,1,0,18
This is really good summer shoes. That is must have. This not only look good! It actually feels perfect on the feet. I wish all colors are in stock. As of today ( 10/01/2019 ) most colors are out of stock.,5,1,18
A great summer sneaker that‚Äôs breathable and lightweight,5,1,18
I'm really disappointed with the quality that amazon is supporting. I got this pair of shoes in january 2018. The net of the shoes was torn in 2 months !!! I gave this product another chance in october 2018 by purchasing again since I thought that product must somehow be old and maybe I'd be at fault and hence the wear and tear. The second pair literally tore in January again!!! I'm extremely disappointed with either very cheap quality products unintentionally getting mixed with the good lot or an intentional manifestation of extremely poor quality products under high prices distributed by amazon.,1,0,18
Puntera y ancho y soporte perfecto queda c√≥mo se espera mi hijo es size 7.5,5,1,18
I loved these shoes because they fit super perfect on my 13 year old son. I would recommend this seller to my family and friends for sure.,5,1,18
Purchased for work. They fit to size and provide much needed comfort. Would purchase again.,5,1,18
I like the shoes quite a bit because they are lightweight good for wearing around the house.,4,1,18

"These shoes were a bit of a surprise. The original photo image was a black shoe with a pink Nike logo. These are like a pink/black tweed. Nothing like the original photo. They fit well, but the original image was misleading.",3,0,18
"These fit true to size and were very comfortable right out of the box. This is a nice, light, breathable shoe. I have not had them long enough to attest to their durability, but, as for comfort and fit, they‚Äôre very nice.",5,1,18
Love them. A 5 Star Buy! I am an Amazon delivery driver and I need comfortable shoes. These are great.,5,1,18
One of the more expensive shoes I‚Äôve bought.,5,1,18
"These were comfortable. I used them as walking shoes. Unfortunately, toe holes started to appear after a few months. The mesh top is really thin and won‚Äôt withstand more than a year of normal use. I would expect shoes to last longer than a year.",2,0,18
"The shoes fit my husband well, after he reordered a 1/2 size up. The shoes run a little small. He normally wears a size 11. They had to be exchanged for an 11 1/2. It‚Äôs a well made shoe.",4,1,18
"I‚Äôve bought these twice now, it‚Äôs like walking on clouds!! They are extremely light and they are high quality. I run many miles in them and they are legit.",5,1,18
These fit as expected. These are good for people who are on their feet all day and give good support.,5,1,18

"Product came very clean but had some decal defects. Some stitching was in the Nike logo. So you can clearly see the blue stitching inside the white nike logo. They fit well but are very snug. I usually buy 11.5 to have a little room but this 11.5 was exact fit. I will say that they are very comfortable and they breathe very well, keeping your feet cool.",4,1,18
"I have ordered these in the past and they are great for running. I reorder when I feel they are loosing support, about 4-6 months. I have 2 pair I rotate.",5,1,18
"May run a 1/2 size smaller than label. Very comfortable and lightweight.
Has style for sneakers.
Like um pretty dog gone good.",5,1,18
i purchased these nike for my neff. who works at dicks sporting goods. He always complaining about his feet hurting after his shift so i puchased these shoes for him. he said these were the best shoes hes ever wore and his feet no longer hurt.,5,1,18
The only shoes that don‚Äôt hurt my feet. They have zero arch support which is good for me because any shoe that supports my arch will hurt my left foot.,5,1,18
"Delivered a week late, but I finally got the shoes and everything was as expected.",5,1,18
"I could not have hoped for such a comfortable moccasin-like sneaker. Well done. Jut so everyone knows, you'll need Totes over them or some other shoe in the rain, the mesh uppers aren't in the least watertight.",5,1,18

I absolutely love how light these shoes are. They wrap my feet in comfort and support. They look attractive as well. For sure will be getting this brand again soon,5,1,18
"Very soft, breathable and comfortable sneakers. Wide size fits fine on my wide feet. These sneakers feel like I'm walking on air and are made very well. I really like how comfortable they make my feet feel. Will buy again.",5,1,18
These are extremely comfortable sneakers to wear on a daily basis. Very lightweight (despite the relatively thick sole). And very breathable.,5,1,18
i purchased it for my son. He loves it and it fits comfortably. looks true to the photo as well. he says its his most comfortable shoe ever mainly because of the strong but breathable material used to make the upper part of the shoe..,5,1,18
Order these for my husband and they fit perfect . He wears a size 12 and has a narrow feet. With the breathable texture on the upper sole it very comfortable.,5,1,18
"These sneakers developed a one to two inch tear where the fabric meets the sole of the shoe. This happened after less than six months of use. Very cheaply made, extremely disappointed in Nike. Never had something like this happen. They fit well and are comfortable, but there is no excuse for such shoddy construction. Nike should refund me, defective product.",1,0,18

Daighter has large feet so bought men's size. Looks and feels great.,5,1,18
These sneakers are perfect for my husband.,5,1,18
"These shoes are not the best looking, but they are so very comfortable. I have achilles tendinosis, and walking is extremely painful. However, the heal on these shoes relieves the pain and make it possible for me to get around. Highly recommended for anyone who is on their feet for extended periods, or if you have sore heals or achilles tendinosis or tendinitis.",5,1,18
They are comfy.,5,1,18
These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I work on my feet all day and these keep me moving and in ZERO discomfort. I usually wear an 11.5 but this is a 12 for me. I'd do a half size bigger for the perfect fit.,5,1,18

I‚Äôve bought these in the past and they were perfect and very comfortable. The seller I bought from this time was different but I wasn‚Äôt disappointed as the product was delivered on time and was as described. Would definitely recommend this product.,5,1,18
these are better than the FreeRun by a long margin... want all of the colors lol. combine with a Superfeet insole and you are in heaven.,5,1,18
These are cute shoes. Nike shoes are not really comfortable more for look.,5,1,18
Very comfortable. Good walking shoe.,5,1,18
"Probably the most COMFORTABLE sneakers I've ever worn. We were making fun of them in the store calling them ""moon shoes', but then I put my feet in them and my face dropped. I went right to checkout and bought them. They are sneakers but feel even more comfortable than slippers. There are no hard seems on them so they fit evenly around your foot with no pressure points. I have a wide foot and these adapted perfectly. I came right on Amazon to buy a second pair. I might even buy a third and hang on to them.",5,1,18
Love these. Super comfortable. I can be on my feet all day in these.,5,1,18
Remarkably lightweight and very well ventilated. I ordered a 1/2 size larger than I usually do and that seems like a good suggestion. A good fit and very comfortable.,4,1,18
"Comfortable, good looking shoes but 6 months in the fabric is starting to rip at the toe. Not durable shoes and will not last longer than a year under daily regular walking use. Would not purchase again.",2,0,18
Bit too narrow.. both shows my pinky toes wore hole thru light mesh.. maybe feet to wide??,2,0,18
"It is a comfortable shoe. I use them for work. Im standing the majority of the day. They do give in soon, but for the price theyre fine. Ive ordered at least 5 pairs so far. No complaints.",5,1,18
These made my ankles start hurting so my feet pain mildly went away lol. You get what you it for don‚Äôt be cheap spend the extra 100 to get something comfy.,1,0,18
My new favorite sneakers. They are so comfortable & breathable. This is actually the second pair that I have bought. They also arrived on time. Great seller & a great item!,5,1,18
"These shoes lack support. They weren't good for running, nor were they good for gym activities, like zumba.",3,0,18
I stand for 8 hours a night working and by far these are the best sneakers I gave ever found !!,5,1,18
"After just a few runs, I‚Äôm already wearing down the tread greatly. This is probably best suited for indoor running and exercises and not any outdoor use. The shoe breathes well and has a snug fit I was wanting, but it seems to be breaking down after only 3 weeks, and I‚Äôm alternating shoes with workouts as well.",3,0,18
I bought them for my husband and he loves them,5,1,18
"These shoes have maybe 1/8 inch of tread, if that, on them. Very easy to slip wearing these. Look great but not happy at all. If you wear them in the smallest bit of snow you better have great health insurance.",1,0,18

Love the shoe fits perfect great price will buy again,5,1,18
"When Nike says ""engineered for all-day everyday comfort,"" they mean it! This is the most comfortable shoe - right out of the box - that I've ever worn.",5,1,18

"A little stiff at first, being new, but this is a good fit",5,1,18
Okay these are my favorite sneakers but the pair I just received are deformed. If you look at the right tip of sneaker it‚Äôs mis-colored but it‚Äôs an overuse of or spill over of glue. Now I‚Äôm stuck with them so be careful ordering online.,5,1,18
"Shoe narrow and small, seemed like material not substantial",3,0,18
They are very soft. But get Half number bigger,4,1,18

It‚Äôs Nike but it‚Äôs a great product,4,1,18
Extremely comfortable and super light weight. Would be 5 stars if they were hi-tops but that's just my personal preference.,4,1,18
Comfortable with good support,5,1,18
Great if you are on your feet alot! Worth every penny.,5,1,18
"Great fit! Very comfortable, breathable fabric uppers, surprisingly good traction given the relatively smooth soles.",5,1,18
Too snug. Worn size 10.5 for 30+ years. Occasionally I‚Äôve had this issue (usually being too narrow) with Nike shoes.,3,0,18
I. Like. Nick. But. Was. Unhappy. Was. Not. The. Bule. I. Order,5,1,18

love the wide base shoes. fit like slippers all day. so comfortable.,5,1,18
Pretty good shoe just a little narrow in the middle of the shoe. I have noticed that the shoe creates a lot of static and I occasionally get shocked when touching anything metal other than that really great shoe.,5,1,18
Nike is my favorite shoe. Very comfortable and lightweight. Feels like you're walking on air.,5,1,18
Wide width and light for the summer heat. Not as much shock absorption as the air max running shoe.,5,1,18

"It fits tight at first but is super comfortable after you break them in, is the perfect fit for running shoes. I love it, the most comfortable running shoes I have ever owened.",5,1,18
I was immediately surprised at how light weight these are. It was like putting on air. Really well ventilated too. And the comfort Is great it's like I could sleep with these. Not in a weird fetish way but just like I could fall asleep while still wearing them on my feet is what I mean.,5,1,18
Everyday wear. Great looks and price.,5,1,18
Comfortable enough but after about 3 months they have no tread at all. I can't even wear these to the cliffs near my house because they are so slippery and it would be dangerous. Useless.,2,0,18
The shoes smell like dirty feet so bad I want to return them but I waited until after the return date that I could return them it is absolutely awful it‚Äôs like someone else worr them before I had them. They have been worn previously Imo. The short time I‚Äôve worn them the soles are worn. This is a pair of used shoes imo,1,0,18

Wore this shoe basically everyday for 2 years just recently the sole has started to come apart and there are holes in the front of each shoe definitely got my money's worth,5,1,18
I bought these for my 13 year old son. He has said twice that they are really comfortable and he likes them. What? A 13 year old actually likes something? Score. Product is as described and fit as expected.,5,1,18
Husband hates them. He‚Äôs a little picky. Said they too narrow and not true to size.,4,1,18

"Best running shoes ever, super lightweight and breathable.",5,1,18
I use the shoes for work averaging 7 miles per day. Always on my feet so comfort was important. Also being a dad of 2 athletic girls they had to be stylish. Achieved both with these.,5,1,18
"I bought these on sale and I loved them when I got them but they were a bit too small, too painful to wear. I wear 9.5 mens in other Nikes so I figured all their shoes run the same...they don't. I wish I could return for a bigger size but the price had more than doubled since I bought them so I just got a refund which was very quick (thank you amazon) I had a refund in my account a few minutes after I dropped them off at UPS store. If buying get a size bigger for sure! maybe a size and half to be safe. Cool shoes though, seemed comfortable and added height.",3,0,18

"These shoes had clearly been worn, and the toe area of the shoe was damaged...you can see the seller tried to repair it and they did an awful job of masking the tear.

"I'm on my feet all day working at a pet hospital and walking on hard floors, and these have been great. No complaints from me and I wear them everyday I work.",5,1,18
"Defiantly would not recommend buying I‚Äôm usually the one who sees ‚Äúwere used, dirty, don‚Äôt get, etc.‚Äù on reviews & still get them Bc pros over way cons but this time I wasn‚Äôt so fortunate shoes had stains on them and scuffs on the bottom. Yeah they were minor and I was able to clean off with acetone but still I shouldn‚Äôt be getting dirty shoes when I‚Äôm paying full price",1,0,18
"I like wearing Nike because regardless of style a 10.5 always fits. These shoes felt comfortable right out of the box. Much better than canvas offerings. I normally prefer suede. However, these leather Ebernon are great.",5,1,18
"BEWARE! I ordered these as a gift for a child in need, and they arrived either defective or fake. One shoe is smaller than the other. One sole is messily glued/attached. I am now stuck with a sad student, no real way to get them back to ‚Äúreturn‚Äù them to Amazon and I paid for garbage. So so disappointing!!",2,0,18
NOT A BAD SNEAKER FOR A NIKE PRODUCT.,4,1,18
"These shoes are timeless and my husband loves them. They are a little easier to crease than he would prefer, but he also expects them to never crease, ever....so that is a bit unreasonable. We paid a great price for them and are more than satisfied with the purchase.",5,1,18
I love them,5,1,18
My son loves the sneaker The sneakers came on time when it was said No scuffs scratches or marks on The shoes are very comfortable he can run you can jump in his feet are warm I‚Äôll update this in a couple of months when he has had time to destroy them. And let you know how they‚Äôre holding up,5,1,18
"The soles are not slip-resistant. Bought this all-leather shoe to wear when it is wet/damp. The sole is very slippery if there is any kind of moisture on the floor or ground, such as outside, or in a gym, or in a kitchen. Hoped it would break in, but no chance. Not worth it.",2,0,18
"Opened the box, checked the shoes, some areas of both shoes are yellowish. Some on the sides, some on the toe area. Looks kinda faded. Not supposed to be yellowish, supposed to be all white.",2,0,18

"The sneaker itself was very stiff and hard and also a bit narrow. The packaging speaks for itself - there was some dents in the sneakers, nothing major.",3,0,18
Just what I wanted and a good buy,5,1,18

Love them !!,5,1,18

"I love this shoe! I ordered as a gift for my really tall grown son for Christmas. I know he‚Äôs going to love them! He has lots of Nike sneakers already. I had never seen any like these. It was the last pair in his size. They are currently unavailable. So glad I was able to order these!

My dilemma:
Some how my sister in law‚Äôs address was saved as our default address. She lives in Texas and we live in the DMV (DC, Maryland, Virginia) area. So... the shoes were going to her house. I realized this when I looked back over my order and saw the address. I immediately contacted the seller and was told it was too late to make changes. I wasn‚Äôt very happy with that answer because, the tracking showed that it had not shipped. I wanted the shoes, I didn‚Äôt want to cancel. I couldn‚Äôt cancel anyway because it was in the process of getting ready to be shipped.
Well, to make a long story short. They fixed it for me! The shoes were delivered to me . I was surprised and thrilled to see that box! I felt like I had just received a Christmas gift! They even changed it to priority shipping and included a hand written note. They did right by me and I am very grateful! They went above to satisfy a customer. Thank you guys!!!! Merry Christmas!",5,1,18
They are very nice it was a great purchase buying my 3rd pair today got them in different colors. Very affordable,5,1,18

"Wanted sturdy pair of Nikes. Good value, really like the fit. Bought these because I had a very similar pair years ago which really lasted, I usually wear out other brand trainers within a couple of months, but these will last a lot longer. Got them for regular use and wear both while exercising and just day to day footwear. Great buy. I had wondered if I‚Äôd prefer other pairs that were twice the price, but when they arrived and I put them on no regrets at all... thrilled with the value and they‚Äôre quality. Probably buy the same ones again, though may be a while before I wear these ones out. The leather is really sturdy so can imagine some people finding they need to wear them in a little around the backs",5,1,18
I can wear for dressing up or taking my dog for a walk. good style for both,1,0,18

"Is there less than a star I could give to this product and especially the Seller GoodSports Outdoor ?
After 3 months of using these shoes in the office and occasionally walking session at nights, the sole cracked open. That is because the exterior rubber sole layer is so thin that there is no way not to quickly get to the air cushion sole, behind the rubber sole. I contacted GoodSports Outdoor and they said I used the too much (in 3 months). The interesting thing is that Amazon knew this was bad product since they kept the option to return this item, after 3 months from purchase.
So, I got my money back form Amazon, but, GoodSports Outdoor refused to consider replacement or refund.
I will never buy, nor I recommend GoodSports Outdoor to anyone. They don't stand by their products.
See attached din the picture how thin is the rubber layer.",1,0,18
The first 2 months this shoe was amazing. I felt like I was walking on clouds. I rarely used them in the beginning but once I started really using them the third month I noticed the squeaked constantly and I didn‚Äôt know why. After awhile I noticed my right lower back started hurting I thought it was because of maybe the way I sat down? Or from working out. BUT after reading some of these reviews it‚Äôs because the right side shoe popped and my balance was off when I walked! Once I bought some different shoes the pain stopped. I paid almost $200 for these shoes and they didn‚Äôt even make it over 5 months of really minimal use. I will NEVER EVER buy another pair of these shoes again and will be contacting someone about the poor quality. Only reason I gave it a 2 was because the look cool even if they did screw up my back.,2,0,18
"didn't last a year. air popped today. purchased January , popped December. if I'm paying almost $200 for a pair of shoes I expect them to last longer than that!",1,0,18
I have used these strictly for running. I have used them maybe 6 times. One of them has already completely deflated. I expect way more for a 190$ pair of shoes. Universal has not responded at all to my questions. Would highly recommend not buying these shoes or dealing with the sellaer,1,0,18
"Very unsatisfied, I received the sneakers with a taped up Nike box that was completely damaged. I took the sneakers out of the box and notice the bottom has dirt on it. The toe top of the sneaker is all creased. I come to figure out that these sneakers have already been worn. I was under the influence that I was purchasing new sneakers. I did not want to buy used sneakers, especially in the time of covid 19.",1,0,18
Sneakers came and looked nice when they came but when I took them out and looked at them I notice a mark in the air bubble at first thought it was glue or something but it wouldn't rub off thought it was a crack but air does not leak out you pay a price like this for sneakers you expect them to be perfect,2,0,18
"The shoe looks great, fits great, but after the break in period shoe material begins to squeeze and shift while walking. I no longer run in them in fear of rolling my ankle. It looks nice but i feel it is no longer safe to long distance run in. Of course these defects show up after I'm able to return them so I'm stuck with a $200+ walking shoe. Some may pay these prices for fashion but I only took a chance and paid this price for the results advertised.",2,0,18
"I have always been a big fan of the Nike air max, I bought these 5 months ago and for 3 months of that I had knee surgery so couldn't even wear them between being bed ridden and crutches. So I've essentially wore the shoes for 2 months and the air pocket on them had a leak so I literally had a flat tire. These are the most comfortable shoes ever until you get a flat tire. For paying over 100 bucks for a pair of shoes you think you should get a lot more out of them. I bet they wouldn't of lasted a week if I was a runner. It is possible that I got a lemon pair and hopefully that's the case.",2,0,18
Recieved these shoes july 27th only used them for work. Im in the medical field and on my feet for 12hr shifts. Last month the left heel air cushion blew out and nike will not replace them.

The 2017 Nike Air Max has been my favorite shoe since I first tried them on.

"I‚Äôve bought tons of Nike sneakers and they come a pretty standard way. These sneakers almost had a feel as though they were refurbished. For examples the shoes were laced up with some shoelaces that barely fit. Seems random but this little detail has my spidey senses tingling. I‚Äôm kinda of feeling as though I should have spent the extra $10, $15 and bought from a legit store.",2,0,18

"At first these were amazing and was happy, 7 months later, worst pair I‚Äôve ever bought. 10months later completely useless. My last pair of air max I bought in 2010 and lasted until March 2016. I bought these last April, soles are completely gone and both air pocketcs have popped. I only wear them to work and take great care of them, which why my last pair last 5 1/2 years. Yes YEARS!! Not months like these. Please refund these or send me a new pair idecitally!! Very pissed off/frustrated/upset customer!!!

Andrew",1,0,18
