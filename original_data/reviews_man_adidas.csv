"I've been wearing a lightweight tennis shoe for work for the past 6 months. So putting these on were much heavier than those, but much lighter than work boots. My first day wearing them I did 160 home deliveries in a thunderstorm/flood advisory that lasted all day, stepping through some pretty large puddles and walked across many mushy/muddy lawns. Then with the bottoms wet, walking onto a stainless steel floor of a truck. The soles gripped well on rocks, gravel, sidewalk, stamped concrete, asphalt, wet trex & wooden porches and even wet stainless steel. Never slipped. Never got my socks wet. Even on a 92 degree day, my feet didn't sweat much. I look forward to taking these hiking on my vacation in 2 weeks, I'll update afterward.

*Update* 12/22/2020
The camping/hiking trip in September 2020 went well. Hiking through mountains and waterfalls my feet stayed dry and gripped well. They arent waterproof, but they have a good balance of water resistance vs mesh to avoid sweat.

Unfortunately I walk around 13 miles/day. I. Purchased these shoes in September 2020. They are coming apart now but after much heavy use. I've walked around 936 miles in 3 months at work alone. 13miles/day, 6 days/week/3months. These shoes should last the average person years to come.",5,1,17
"Purchased these to hike in spring/summer/fall. Got them in time for a trip to the Adirondacks. Coming from Merrel hiking boots and shoes I can easily say these are the best hiking shoes I’ve owned. I don’t usually write reviews, so know that if I felt compelled enough to review, they’re worth it.

Incredibly comfortable right out of the box, I didn’t feel like I needed to break them in at all. I typically wear wider shoes because narrow shoes hurt my feet. Zero discomfort walking to hiking. And the traction on all surfaces was amazing.

Highly recommend these shoes, just not for cold weather, they breathe really well but probably wouldn’t provide any warmth.",5,1,17
"I have many pairs of hiking shoes, most of them are gortex lined. I was looking for a pair specifically not waterproof for a trail I hike monthly which has a water crossing, bc it’s deep enough that water comes in from the top making the gortex useless. Plus once water gets in, it can’t get out and it’s miserable.
These were not as comfortable out of the box as my Solomon hiking boots, or my ASICS gel-venture everyday shoes, but they were decent. Where these shoes shine is traction. I just completed the before mentioned hike and these performed marvelously. I had awesome traction through the water and on the slick rocks. After the crossing hiked another 2+ miles with no issues. The shoes were comfortable the rest of the way and I almost walked them dry. My socks were soaked of course but no big deal, I had fresh socks and shoes at the truck.
If these shoes last, I will be extremely pleased. I will update after more use.",4,1,17
"Others had mentioned that they're loose in the heal - and they are correct even when laced tightly. I will go hiking tomorrow and give an update on 2 hours for fit and traction on sandy dirt( y) soil and report back later.

Style is awesome from the sides, top side is lackluster at best. Bottom tread is confusing but we shall soon see if the new treads grip or slip. ???

Review update 10-28-2019. This shoe surprisingly had great traction on dry loose dirt and mild rocks and gravel on a recent 5 mile trail test. The stiff bottom rubber sole is uncomfortable on sidewalks IMHO. However, on the hiking trails they are sturdy ""grippy"" and reliable. Quite pleased with the price, quality of construction and performance so far.",4,1,17
"I bought these for my trip to Ireland. I needed shoes for every type of terrain from paved walkways to dirt paths to walking on rocks and also waterproof. I was not disappointed, these shoes passed every test. My socks did not get wet once and it rained a lot! And the grip walking on slippery rocks was outstanding, I felt confident with every
step. I got the blue shoes which I think looks great.",5,1,17
"Just received the shoes and tried them on in the house just to get a feel for it. Will update later down the road but these are my first impressions:

1) I used to own the AX2 in size 9 and they fit perfectly. I purchased these in size 9 and they also fit, which is a plus that there’s hardly any deviation in size.
2) Like other folks are saying, the heel feels kinda loose no matter how tight you tie your shoes. This is concerning, so I’ll have to see how well it holds by the next update.
3) There’s hardly much for cushioning or arch support. If I recall correctly, my AX2 shoes were comfy to wear regarding arch and cushioning. These however you will have to buy different insoles to match your arch unless you have flat feet, but even then you may need to buy new insoles to deal with the fact the factory insole doesn’t have much in means of cushioning.
4) For those coming from Salomon shoes (I wear men’s size 8.5 for Salomons) I would recommend getting a half size larger, hence why I bought size 9 for adidas.

Compared to the Salomon Speedcross 4 which is the pair of shoes I’m replacing, I like the fact they fit my wide feet without a break-in period and the treads actually feel like they have good traction. However I don’t like the lack of arch support or cushioning which the Salomon speedcross has.
Hopefully I’ll remember to update",3,0,17
I would have given this a 5 star but I bought them for my husband to work in and he absolutely loves them and will not wear them for work. He says they are too nice to wear them out and price was very decent and was one of the reason I purchased this shoes. I was looking for a hiking shoe that would last more than a few weeks in the Florida summer but he likes them to well to wear every day.,4,1,17
These run a little snug (true to size for regular wear) so if you’re going to be doing any distance or trekking go up a little in size. I went up a half size and they feel great. They fit great out of the box so I know when I put some superfeet in them they’re gonna be fantastic. Plan on taking these for the Camino de Santiago so will update this after.,5,1,17
"I typically go hiking once a week and for a while had just been using tennis shoes with memory foam in the bottom. However the more experienced I became the longer and more rugged my hikes became. After doing a 12 mile hike and getting several blisters on my feet and dealing with constant slippage on the trail I needed a change.

After having worn these for 2 months I can honestly say these Addidas hiking shoes have revolutionized how my feet should feel at the end of a days hike. I get incredible traction on different trails. Especially when going down hill or on patches of loose gravel. I also haven't gotten a single blister on my feet since wearing these and have gone on 2, 15 mile hikes.

On a side note I personally enjoy the small orange accents from the inside of the shoes sole. I like orange as a color and typically most products will over power shoes with it making them annoyingly bright orange, but these offer a satisfying accent that i and my hiking partners find very stylish.

I'm not sure how long these will last but after 2 months of regular hiking there are no tears, signs of wear, or chipping in the bottom traction. I expect at the current rate to get a year out of them if not more. Furthermore I would recommend these to anyone who is doing regular hiking and looking for great value for money shoe without needing to spending over $100 on steel toed or spiked hoking shoes.",5,1,17
"Adidas sold strong well-built shoes. I have four pairs of different colors for work. They will probably outlive me. They are strong enough to hike with. I have narrow, high arch feet. They are a great fit. I just have to tighten them a bit. Very comfortable but at the end of a long day might seem a little heavy. Sole is solid with many lugs for gripping when needed.",5,1,17
"I was so excited to get these. I love Adidas as a company and their sneakers fit great. This style, however, fits poorly at best. It's not just snug, it's uncomfortable. Some folks buy hiking shoes up a size and I feel like Adidas should take fit into account when they calibrate for size. I'm also peeved at the seller because I paid almost $10 for delivery and will have to pay more then $5 to return them. Also -- I'm pretty sure they're not new since they came with a receipt from Dick's Sporting Goods in the box -- OOPS -- as well as a fishing license holder and the receipt for that as well.
Scandalous, I know. An Amazon seller running a game.",1,0,17
"These shoes look nice. Unfortunately the heel cap feels pretty wide and loose with my foot, I find myself getting hot spots after about 3mi or a couple of hours on my feet in them. The do breathe well and quality of construction seems pretty good but time will tell. Overall just okay.",3,0,17
"A modern looking shoe with what seems like a funny fit, and seems to need considerable breaking in.

I picked a 10.5 (my athletic shoe size), and found the the fit...odd. The toe is pointed rather than rounded, so there's extra space at the tip, but my big toe hits the front. Odd design, since feet don't have a point in the center... Even cinched tightly, my heel slips a little (but doesn't come out). I'd need to use a spacer or wear heavy socks. The fit is okay at best.

The sole is pretty rigid for a lightweight shoe, like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a trail runner or a hiking shoe.

I may be spoiled by other brands that are ""ready to wear"", or may not be used to Adidas' design choices. But I don't want to spend the time breaking this shoe in hoping the fit is better once it's well-worn. It's going back.",3,0,17
"I started shopping for a new cross trainer shoe in Aug 2021. I don't know what has happened to the shoe industry. Hilariously hideous selections in the dept & retail stores. Everything I saw that may have been a possible option was a type of running shoe. If not a running shoe, they were every other kind of shoe except a cross trainer. Worth mentioning again that almost every shoe that was an option was hideous & not a cross trainer. What in the world happened to shoes?

I ended up going to one of the big chain outdoor stores. Over in the hiking section among the boots & hiking shoes, BOOM!! Found these Addidas! Just a few color options but finally, cross trainers that looked awesome & performed as good as they looked.

Their listed price was better than any of the other shoes I had shopped up to that point, easily. $100 - $120 for the hideous shoes, $80 - $90 for these. I did a little research & found that the same shoe on Amazon was selling for nearly 40% less. Yes!

Thank you to the seller here on Amazon for listing these at a discount. My shoes arrived today. I put them on right away & love them. The fit was perfect & they feel great. Going to put them to good use. And probably buy a back up pair asap.

I usually wear a 9.5 - 10 in most Nikes, Addidas, Reebok, New Balance and so on. Took a shot on these in a 9.5 and that was the right decision.

I would recommend these to anyone looking to upgrade their cross trainers / hiking shoes.",5,1,17
"I bought 2 of these. They're my favorite trail runners I've had in a long time. I've been buying Adidas trail runners since the early 90's and I'm really happy with these. They're basically exactly like the trail runners but in the hiking shoe category because of the sturdy build which I find are perfectly great for trail jogging. I have gone hiking and jogging around the trails on pavement, grass and dirt and just love these. The sturdiness of the show is what I'm really impressed by. They're a touch heavier and stiffer than the trail running shoes, but if you're looking for a well made trail runner that will last you, I think these are the best Adidas I've had since the earlier trail runners they used to make in the 90's. I feel they're making sneakers intentionally crappy lately so you will buy more often. I'm loving these so far. I hope they continue making models like this build in the future. I think they look awesome too.",5,1,17
"I'm 4 for 4 buying shoes on Amazon. Over the years I ordered SWAT Sneaker boots, Sketcher leather boots (fit like a glove after break-in) and today my new Adidas Terrex AX3 Hiking Shoes. I love the design and was able to wear them to work today. I received compliments on their looks and eventually came to feel somewhat comfortable in them.

My 1 con is that they are little tight, around the toes (narrow not wide).

I wore thin dress socks and tied them snug and as I walked in them throughout the day they became more comfortable. I think these will need some break in time to become truly comfortable. I recommend at least 1/2 size bigger for those men who like to wear their shoes in wide size or looser.

I'm always leery about buying shoes online without trying them first. So far I have been lucky with Amazon. thanks to the retailer got them within a couple of days.

I will pics shortly",4,1,17
"These things are written up as a hiking shoe, but they're also excellent for trail running. I've got about 50 miles worth of running miles in them on mud, concrete, dirt, and gravel. They aren't showing any signs of tread loss yet, so they're quite durable. The deep tread gives excellent traction is perfect for the hill and mountain dirt trails that I run. They've also got good support and padding, so I've noticed a decent decline in aches and pains vs my old shoes. They're so good for my purposes that I'm considering buying a couple more just to hold on to for the future.

If you're looking for a good set of trail runners, this is it.",5,1,17
"I usually hike in my old running shoes, but was getting some foot pain ahead of a long overnight hike. I was back and forth between hiking boots or hiking shoes - and opted for these. I didn't like not feeling the ground beneath my feet with boots, or that clunky feeling that accompanies them.

I wear a 12 usually, and read the reviews to order them a 1/2 side up. The 12.5s are plenty big enough - they give my feet about a thumbs-worth of distance between my toes and the inside of the shoes. But they're definitely not too big - so I'd say they fit perfectly.

They are heavier than I expected, but they're sharp looking. Way more supportive than I would have predicted. Great grip too.

The only complaint is that the heel area seems a bit large. From the midfoot to the toes, these things are money. The heel just feels a little big. It didn't affect me much - you only notice it give up steep climbs. It didn't create uncomfortable rubbing, but I only took them out for about five miles.

Overall, I like them. Really affordable, sharp, and way more support than your average running shoe. So my foot feels better already. While I'm sure they're not as clunky as boots, they still carry some beef with them, and they have a wide heel area.",4,1,17
"They look cool to me, and fit good, maybe a little narrow, but that's normal for some brands, if you've worn Adidas before, you know how they are, Ive always liked the appearance of Adidas outdoor/trail hiking type shoes, and I finally got one, the only thing I dont like so far is the rubber toe guard I'll call it, it gets scuffed to easy and its seems permanent, it doesn't show that much on black but if it was white that would suck, the bottoms are made by Contenetal tire company, so that's kinda neat, there comfortable for long hours, they repel water very good, and dont find them hotter than other tennis shoes, it's more like a basketball shoe, than a jogging breathable shoe, so good for work especially if its wet or cold work, I've only wore them for a couple of months, so I cant speak on longevity, but usually brands like Adidas are long lasting, I think the regular price us a little high, but that's normal, I got lucky and found a great sale on my size only.",5,1,17
"If only the toe box wasn't so narrow, this would be a 5-star review! However, ...

I ordered Adidas Men's Terrex Ax3 low-rise Hiking Boots as a possible replacement candidate for my all-time favorite hiking shoes, Adidas Rockadias (see my review for the Rockadia 3) which are no longer made. I am really impressed with the build quality, the ""Continental"" grippy soles, the asymmetrical finger loops on the heels, the thick non-slip shoe laces, and on and on. I think I've found my replacements.

After a half-dozen day hikes wearing these shoes, I developed a blister under the callus on my right big toe. A huge painful blister. I do have somewhat wide feet. A D width is about perfect for me for most trail runners and hiking shoes. So, if you have narrow feet (A through C), these may have enough toe box room for you without adjusting the lacing.

However, I did adjust the tightness of the laces near the toes, and all seems well now.",4,1,17
"These are very comfy and have good grip. I was a bit nervous because I ordered these right before going camping/hiking, and historically I’ve needed to break in hiking shoes otherwise I’d end up with blisters and sore feet. But, I wore them and had no issues. Definitely recommend. Only other thing I’d like to mention - since they are low tops, they don’t really have good protection against ankle rolling, so if you are prone to that sort of thing or going to be hiking through rocky/difficult terrain, it might be worth considering a high top.",5,1,17
"I bought theses based off of reviews, boy was I wrong. I couldn’t even walk around the house without my feet hurting. These shoes run extremely narrow in the front and are lose in the back. Every step I took my front side of the foot rubbed, as for my heels, they would lift off from the shoes. Maybe I got a faulty pair but I haven’t had a lot of luck with shoes on Amazon.

I’m not even sure how to rate how the fit is for these shoes. If I had to rate them, it would be goofy.",1,0,17
"I initially bought these in an 11 and a half. I've got another pair of Adidas in that size that fit me. But I had to return them for an 11 which fit just fine. These Adidas took an unusually long time to break in and for a while they really hurt. That said, now that they are broken in, they feel great. I bought these to play disc golf and for backpacking and they work fantastic you're both activities. They are kind of heavy and I wouldn't use it for running but you want to hiking shoe to be kind of heavy. I played disc golf 2 to 3 times a week in these and ,,, they are holding up well. I also wear them to work about half the time. I especially like the Continental soul the Continental sole, which seems a little softer or off pavement use. Your mileage may vary. Cheers!",5,1,17
"Runs a little small, so ordering a half a size up may be advisable for some people. Shoes have great traction, but aren't the most comfortable.
Also, it's hardly even water resistant, my socks get wet regularly when handling hoses on the job. So if that's important for you then this isn't the one for you.",3,0,17
"Like others have said, Gore-Tex is NOT waterproof in the same way that a rubber rain boot is, but this is by design. If you look at any diagram of what Gore-Tex material is, you'll see that there is no impermeable layer. It's highly water resistant, but not some sort of barrier.

With that said, these shoes offer a good amount of water resistance, and the soles are pretty tough. I recently took a 400 mile road trip through Colorado and wore these on all of the hikes. They are no worse for wear, but your results may vary.

Overall, I like that they're one solid color so they blend in better with general workout clothes as well as hiking clothes. They fit as expected and have performed well on fishing trips, as well as easy to moderate difficulty hikes.",4,1,17
"I bought these specifically to go hiking in Colorado for a week. I’m not an avid, super hiker, just a husband and dad who carried our daughter on a backpack. Even with the added 25lbs, I experienced no discomfort.

Others noted these run small. I was a bit hesitant to purchase these shoes and I would agree, but ONLY with a few millimeters of variation. I wear 11 in my normal shoes, and bought 11 and wouldn’t change the size.

Overall I love the design, and they functioned as I expected. If I had to buy them again I would!",5,1,17
"I usually wear a mens 12-13. I ordered these in a 13. Turns out they are so narrow that I dont think they would have been wide enough, had I ordered them in a 15. Tried to wear them around the house, un-laced, on 3 different attempts and I was never able to make it past 2-3 minutes. Completely unwearable...and i apparently missed the return window by 1 day.",1,0,17
"I went on a 75degree incline up a mountain through rocks, traversed through slippery rocks, rivers, and miles of rock and debris, climbed walls of stone, and even went as far as ridding a horse with them. Good thing I bought these shoes because what would have been extremely hard to do was not only alleviated by comfort but also by the amount of grip it had.

this is the shoe to have during a very hard trail for someone who is far from being an expert at trailing.",5,1,17
"Probably the best hiking shoe I've had in over 5 yrs. Breaking them in wasnt bad. I walk on pavement and hike the hills and mtns of Montana with ease. Great traction and cushion. They really grip good on rocks and dirt. Going to buy a 2nd pair to keep for when I beat these ones up too bad to wear.
I wear a 12W or 13. These have a wider toe box with a narrow heel. Keeps your foot locked in place without slipping out when your traversing some steep hills.",5,1,17
"Negative: These shoes, as others have described, are not very comfortable. Stiff sole. Tight toe box. I would say I possibly needed to size up, but the heel slipped a little as well.
Positives: They do have good grip and seemed to be holding up well over aprox 50 miles of off road use.
I bought these because they were inexpensive but every time i wore them i got blisters.
I gave them away and bought something else.",3,0,17
"These are great casual day hiking shoes. Just came back from a sandy, rocky area, and they had great traction, with not a lot of effort (and it was HOT). Got them wet accidentally stepping in river, they were fine. And they're good looking...I'd like to find a similar pair for walking long distance on pavement or gravel, which would be a little less stiff, and a little less traction. They are a tad on the narrow/small size, so I had to return and order 1/2 size higher.",5,1,17
"I thought i had scored a great deal on these sturdy trail runners. For the most part they met expectations. They provide firm support, the tread is dependable and they are comfortable for long hikes in the terrain I frequent. But quality control was poor. The cloth lining around the opening of the shoe was shoddy material and is already worn through from normal use. I am extremely disappointed and discouraged with ADIDAS brand right now. I have worn nothing but their footwear for the past 5 years. This is my first encounter with shoddy material and workmanship.",3,0,17
"I love my Adidas AX2 but they’re wearing out. Figured I’d get these AX3s as a replacement. My US11.5 AX2s fit like they were custom made - and lasted forever! But the AX3s in US11.5 are easily 1/2 size small - look at them side-by-side and the difference is quite obvious. My AX2s were made in China and the AX3s are made in Vietnam; I have no idea if this has anything to do with the sizing mismatch.

I’m not sure what’s up with Adidas these days. Part of what I like about the brand beside durability is the true-to-size attribute throughout their line. A US11.5 Adidas shoe has ALWAYS been my size, back to when I played tennis in my trusty Adidas Barricades. Lately, you’ll see many comments about how they now run small.",1,0,17
"I am not sure what shape feet these shoes are supposed to fit, but it isn't mine. My feel feels like it is sitting more on top of the shoe than in the shoe if that makes sense. Like how it would feel if you put TWO insoles in your shoes.
The construction and material seem good, I like the way they look, I just wish they were not a strange shape causing excess heel lift. Will be returning.",2,0,17
"Light weight, pretty durable so far. Have used for about a month with almost daily rounds of disc golf, which is notoriously tough on shoes. I typically go through 3-4 pairs of high end hiking shoes a year. These after a month of use show minimal signs of ware. Only issue is/was discomfort when lacing them tight, they put a lot of pressure on the top of my foot, had to readjust regularly for the first week, or two. The issue has gone away now that the issues are broken in but they definitely caused some discomfort for a while.",4,1,17
"These shoes are very stiff, do not conform well to my feet, and wearing them occasionally for less than 2 months has worn out the material of the inner heel and tears up the heels of all my socks. They haven’t broken in, they’ve just broken down. Wouldn’t recommend.",1,0,17
"I was wearing these around the house and outside to break them in before their first hike. There I was... in my backyard replacing my propane tank on the grill when I completely failed to notice a hornets nest while unscrewing the tank. Apparently they don’t like me hanging around. I ran. I kid you not, I had to make a wide 180 degree turn to get in the front door and these shoes gripped my dog-dug-up grass to the rocky driveway to the wooden steps EVERY bit of the way. I am sting free and couldn’t be happier with these shoes!",5,1,17
"I got a 'used' pair for $40, but they still had the tags on them so I'm not complaining.

They looked a little weird out of the box, but when I put them on not only did they look good but they fit and felt great.

The only thing I have left to do is the test of time, my previous boots/shoes came undone 6mo later so I hope these stay together.",5,1,17
"Bought these Adidas hiking shoes in July after having several pairs of Merrills over the years that lasted very well. These seemed good, but came home after walk today 7 months later with a blister on my right heel. Checked and the padding on that heel had totally broken down causing my heel to rub against the hard back support piece. So, throwing these Adidas shoes away and shopping for other brand.",1,0,17
"Reviewing shoes is hard because everyone's feet are different so take this for what it’s worth:

First time out with them today. Did some Geocaching/hike for about 4 hours, nothing extreme. Planning on doing Mt. San Jacinto which peaks at 10,800 at the end of June and want to break these shoes in first.

Pros: seem to be built well, good traction, comfortable sole

Con: narrow toe box

Hoping it loosens up in the toe as the shoes break in. Will edit if needed",4,1,17
"Comfortable and support hell yes. But only 2 weeks life in these bad boys. Good price but not made to last. Great look too, a little sad.",2,0,17
I bought these as I was going on a trip to AZ and was going to hike around Sedona and the Grand Canyon. I hiked the Devil's Bridge trail in Sedona and the Bright Angel trail in the Grand Canyon and these were fairly stylish and very comfortable even after hours of hiking! To me they seemed to fit slightly large but I would say they're pretty close to size. My only complaint if you want to call it that was a lack of ankle support but these aren't boots and I knew that going into the purchase. I knew it was going to be hot out there and I didn't want something roasting my feet.,5,1,17
"Felt great at home. Then I got them on the trail. Wore them on day two. ""Didn't have time to pull them out of the bottom of my hiking pack for day 1"" Took them off after a couple hours on day 2. Never put them back on.

MAYBE it's my toes, but I put my steel toe boots back on for the remainder of the trip and my feet feel fine. If I had kept these on I am 100% sure my toes would be in tatters.

I had really high hopes for these because they felt great the day I tried them out for work.",2,0,17
"Bought these for my husband for Fathers Day and he loves them! He’s wanted a pair of hiking shoes for awhile but didn’t want anything too clunky or ugly, and these are PERFECT. Great traction and grip, extremely durable. We are in AZ so great on desert terrain; unsure of other terrains as we haven’t had the opportunity to go yet, but can only imagine they’d be great.",5,1,17
"I tried these one and while they seem good overall, the toe box is way too small. I tried my regular size and a half size up. For me the toe box was a deal breaker. Even the slightest movement of the toes was restricting.

I don't have large toes or anything. This design just wasn't for me. I ended up getting the Adidas Terrex Tracerocker instead.",3,0,17
"Absolutely fantastic hiking shoes. At first I was hesitant with how they felt around the heel, however they broke in fast. They have quickly became my favorite shoes. Just went to colorado hiking for a week and they performed better than expected. Great traction and light weight. Wore them for hours hiking and my feet felt great the whole time.",5,1,17
"This product is advertised as a hiking shoe, would expect that to mean high quality durable materials. In less than two months the linning has began to fall apart. Holes appearing in the material, no even where it would be particularly worn by use. Other materials seem to be fine, but the linning let's an otherwise nice product down",2,0,17
"Finding a one pair fits all to wear when coaching football seems impossible. Until you buy these shoes. No matter sun, rain, or hurricane conditions these shoes are perfect. Comfort is amazing, sizing is spot on, and they look great. Going to buy another pair or two and keep in the closet until they are needed. Would highly recommend buying these shoes!",5,1,17
"I bought these shoes to wear while playing disc golf. I needed a pair of shoes that got excellent wet grass traction and these sure do fit that bill. The grip tee pads, loose gravel and just about anything else really well. I also really like the arch support and they don't roll. I wear them every single time I disc golf now.",5,1,17
"Got these for hiking and hiking over rocks is so much easier. They grip so good I feel safe going down hill.

Are pretty water resistant. Just don't dip foot into water because water will get in through the top of the shoe.

Otherwise. Love these shoes. Got some for my mom to hike as well.",5,1,17
I usually blow through a pair of timberland hiking boots in 4 months but i have had these for 9 months and they are just starting to come apart in the front. I working in florida so its always really wet and hot. Im always getting them soaked then drying them on a shoe dryer. So i believe these shoes would last a normal person along time. Im currently buying another pair.,5,1,17
"So far they are holding out.
I work out on the Ramp at my airport and they are pretty good. Don’t have any issues with them and they have been holding on so far.
Haven’t tried them out in the winter weather since I work in the south but through out the rain and heat they have felt comfortable.",5,1,17
"Whoever said these are waterproof or even water resistant definitely never tried it to be true. Just a casual walk thru a park on wet grass from rain showers the night before my socks where very wet maybe 10 mins in. No puddles no small running water just very wet grass will ruin your day with these shoes. They fit great, feel grippy which is great but I was expecting some water resistance at the very least.",3,0,17
"Worn these shoes for about 5 months as work shoes through the summer. I both love and hate them. I love them because they have great support, were extremely comfortable, and I just like the look of them too.
Now the downsides... in only 5 month, as a work shoe, not hiking, the soles are almost entirely worn smooth, I dont even have to walk a whole lot, im an autoglass technician, so its just climbing all over cars and semi trucks.
The heel supports are now wearing through the inside of the heel, starting to dig into my achilles.
The price when I bought these was also $79usd and had prime delivery. And now that I need another pair, they have gone up 20 bucks plus 10 dollar shipping.

They are great shoes, for a short period of time. I've had worse made shoes for sure. But these still aren't made too well. Very good for one season though.",3,0,17
"Great sturdy shoes, fits great, I normally wear 9.5-10, size 10 was perfect.
The soles are sturdy and provide good support on rocky trails.
The soles protector is ""spiky"" and provides great grip.
Haven't tested eater resistantce yet- did not have a chance yet.

Overall: I would recommend it to a friend and would buy it again for light to average hiking trails",5,1,17
"This is the 9th different pair of shoes I have ordered and they have all been the same. Too narrow, no padding, uncomfortable. Very disappointed. I have plenty of 9 1/2 size shoes that fit perfectly. I believe the shoe manufacturers are no longer using American feet as a gauge for their shoes.",1,0,17
"For the most part it was a good shoe with good traction, good fit, but I went on my first hike and it was a normal trail without any obstacle about 4 miles loop, and the left shoe ripped near the ankle area. Like seriously I paid 80 dollars for these, I expect it to last a little longer than one hike and little more than 4 miles before it freaking rips! At first I was like whatever’s and take it on my second hike a few days later, about 5miles loop straightforward trail, and the other side ripped as well. Like wtf?! So disappointed at what they send out.... where is your quality support ! If this shoe can’t handle normal straightforward short hikes, how can you call this a hiking shoes? Come on adidas you are better than this! Waste my money..... hiked 9miles before it ripped...don’t buy just go for an actual reputable hiking outdoor brands",1,0,17
"I bought this shoe as a work shoe for both a restaurant and painting. Not to mention I spend a fair amount of time outdoors. So this shoe seemed liked a good all in one for me.
The shoes came in time as claimed and they fit perfectly. I’m a size 10 and they where about as true as you could get. I originally thought they were too narrow but after wearing them everyday I’m glad they are a little snug. Great support! They are perfect for my long serving shifts and comfortable on a ladder to paint as well as great for running trails. Amazing grip.
I’ve had these now for about 4 months and as you can see in the photo they have very little wear considering how much I wear these shoes.",5,1,17
They look good. But after only 6 weeks of use some of the material is wearing. These are not waterproof either.,2,0,17
"I love adidas, have for years. But these on the other hand, not so much. I only wore them once(and yes, I understand about ""you've got to break them in"") but Good Lord a new pair of shoes should inflict this much pain! Was literally like wearing a pair of wooden clogs. Roomie but painful. Had to return.",1,0,17
"I wanted waterproof hikers, the younger on these doesn’t have a seal to prevent your foot from getting wet. I have the damp socks to prove it. Also, the sole is very stiff, not exactly the ideal hiker when going long distances.",1,0,17
"I own 3 pairs of these shoes. They're awesome for Every day wear, or Hiking, walking, mountain climbing etc.

Basically any outdoor activity you could think of, these shoes are perfect for. I have a brand new pair tucked away in our survival kit, and an extra pair in the Truck. I love these shoes.

If you can find these for less than $100 snatch em up.",5,1,17
These are my first pair of hiking shoes and I have to say they were comfortable all day when I wore them on my hiking trip a week ago. The price wasn’t bad either as I saw some of the other prices of hiking shoes. I’m an Adidas fan anyway so it worked out. We hiked for a good 5 to 6 hours and my feet didn’t hurt at all. Sure I was exhausted after a hike on a very hot day but overall tho great shoes. They fit perfectly too.,5,1,17
"The shoe looks just like the online pictures, and it was perfect for my size (12 medium). It is easy to pull on and off. The lacing is well thought-out and efficient. I especially appreciate the angled pull tab. The fit is right in the middle of size 12 fits in my experience, and there's just enough support to be comfortable without noticing it. They seem to be at least as well-made as my old Adidas which they replace, and if I can get similar service, I will be very happy.",5,1,17
"These shoes were bought for work where I do construction half the week and they are holding up great 2 months later. It took a couple of hours to ""break in"" and even then it wasn't too bad. I will say that it doesn't feel like I'm walking on clouds but I also don't feel like I'm barefoot either. I've had some shoes that feel amazing at first but don't last and they are horrible on my feet after 3 months. These have keep a good even keel so far. It's a good shoe for hard workers and are tough on shoes but also still look stylish. I'll update 6 months down the road if they are still kicking.",5,1,17
"These shoes are almost perfect, but as other have said the heel is loose. They work all right for a couple hour hike. Wouldn't want to hike all day in them, and definitely wont be running in them. The grip is incredible, but unfortunately doesn't make up for the fit. Maybe order a half size down, and try them around the house - if the heel slips though I'd return them.",3,0,17
"when i walked it didnt feel right! Maybe i bought them for the wrong reason? but ive had adidas for 5 years now, and love them, but now i have to switch! after 2 different styles....maybe they are going a little cheaper now in the production, idk.....",3,0,17
"Just got them today and my little walk around the block was nice, I can't wait to hike with them as I walked over some stone tonight I could barely feel them. I got the black grey and orange style and I think they look great. The tread is awesome underneath",5,1,17
"I love these shoes, I use them primarily for work and hiking, they are sturdy and the sole has a strong rubber that protects my foot from sharp rocks or other objects that tennis shoes would not absorb well. They are a heavy shoe but that’s not a bad thing, they have held up well for 2 months now. Being a low profile shoe does mean you won’t have ankle support so keep that in mind.",5,1,17
Amazing shoe. Warm and sturdy. I rarely have shoes that fit and feel good right from the start but these did. Pretty water resistant. I wear In the rain and wet grass all the time. Great sole. Lots of traction and cleans out very well. Great walking or hiking shoe. Protects the bottom you foot and gives good support when walking on a really rocky trail.,5,1,17
"I bought a nice pair of regular hiking boots, but found them to be too heavy and clunky for the hiking that I do. I ordered these as a second pair and they are far more comfortable for shorter half-day hikes. They have awesome traction, even on wet rocks.",5,1,17
"I got my first pair of Terrex shoes at Costco and was blown away by how comfortable they were compared to regular running shoes. My feet are wide, and these accommodate the width better than running shoes, even expensive ones, supposedly wide ones. I liked them so much, that I bought this pair before the other ones wore out (I'm still wearing them, too). This is the newer model (I think the old ones were AX2), and they are just as nice.",5,1,17
These feel amazing on my feet since I do alot of walking at work just because I like to reach my step goal of 10k a day. Very comfy on my feet as well since I have wide feet and don't wanna have my toes packed into the shoe like sardines so they accommodate wide feet.,5,1,17
"I bought this 1/2 size larger than I usually do. The overall fit was fine but it pinched the toes. I should have returned them. The sole design also really collects dirt. Other than that, a nice shoe if you have a narrow foot.",2,0,17
"The shoes arrived and looked really nice upon inspection. I should have listened to other reviewers when they stated the heel was loose. After trying them on, my feet fit in them like a normal shoe, but the heel was surprisingly wide. When you walked, it felt as if your foot was going to come out of the shoe. The house shows I bought from Walmart literally for better than these lol

While they did look nice, and felt comfy while standing, they were just too loose on the heel. Not sure an average size persons foot could fill them out.

Amazon refunded them promptly and I decided to order some ASICS trail shoes and they fit perfectly.",2,0,17
Very disappointed. I have these same shoes in a different color and love them! These are the same size and model but crunch my toes.... was hoping they needed to break in or maybe it was my socks or something so I didn't send them back so my bad....,2,0,17
"Cushion seems well made and firm, looks and feels like a good running/trail shoe. The shoe itself breaths well, solid made sole that appears to be attached good to the shoe. Price for the shoe was tolerable considering where it’s made and the materials used.",5,1,17
These are my 4th pair of terrex adidas shoes. They are well mafe and are my favorite shoes to wear. If you have wide feet these are going to be a tight fit and not for you. Will continue to by adidas terrex shoes. True to size..9 1/2.,5,1,17
These things DIG. It feels like I'm being propelled forward as I walk in them. On the street they feel a little like cleats. But it's not that bad. My only gripe is how sand gets kicked in each shoe with every step. This is kind of an issue cuz I hate rocks in my shoe. Kinda have to walk with a wide stance. Perhaps if they were tighter. I don't like my shoes too tight.,4,1,17
"I am embarrassed to admit this but I spend $150+ on a big name brand shoe that looks similar to this shoe. I can’t tell the difference between them when I am wearing them.

This is a great shoe that is comfortable and supportive.

Thanks foe a great product. Keep up the good work.

Brett H",5,1,17
"Love these shoes, they are super comfy, rugged, look great and have great trail traction. I own a couple of colors and sizes run true for all. You'll like them for sure and they never seem to show wear even with miles and miles of trails behind them",5,1,17
"I’ve owned a pair of Terrex Swift X2 that, if it hadn’t been for the eyelets being ripped/cut by the sharp/hard laces, I would still be wearing them after 4 years. The AX3 have just as good of a grip and they are probably a little more comfortable, too. They are holding up very nicely! Lacing is thicker and softer, so I don’t think they will rip the eyelets on these shoes. Check back with me in 4 years haha",5,1,17
"I found the Men's Terrex hiking shoe to be very good looking and comfortable to hike in,, but with one issue. The sole is very firm, so much so that I find it uncomfortable on pavement. So these shoes are destined for use on trails and bushwhacking, where they excel. They are also really good looking.",4,1,17
"These arrived on a Thursday. Saturday, I hiked 10 miles in the mountains. Sunday, I hiked another 5. Zero sore spots. Zero blisters. Zero things I'd change about these. 10/10",5,1,17
"Bought my husband a size 13 for walking trails. He has worn these for a few months through shallow puddles, mud, snow and ice. They have kept his feet dry and actually were a little slip resistant due to the groves on the bottom of the shoes. They seem to be very durable and are comfortable as well. He would recommend these shoes!",5,1,17
First hiking shoe. Bought them for a week long camping trip and they are great. Comfortable and very good construction so far. Usually wear a 11 but ordered 11.5 like others suggest and they fit great.,5,1,17
I really liked the way they look but they have just fallen apart. Have had them less than two month and only wear on the weekend. Not durable at all. Pretty disappointed.,2,0,17
"Awesome shoes, price a little high. As far as tread wow beyond my expectations. Comfortable as clouds. With adidas I always get one size above so for example I normally wear an 11half but I get a 12 in these shoes",5,1,17
"I always think of hiking shoes as functional but fugly however these really do look sharp. Mine fit perfectly and I don’t feel like a dork in them. aesthetics aside, the real highlight to me is the outsoles. The continental tire grip was put to the test on my very first outing with them in the Maine woods and the wet rocks were no obstacle. made me feel like an actual hiker lol.",5,1,17
These are incredibly durable and not hideous looking. Hiking shoes usually end up looking like your foot is covered in hot dog buns of varying quality. These shoes are perfect for dog walks in the park as well as hiking around on rough terrain. Super comfortable. Love them.,5,1,17
I do not use them for hiking or trail running. Use as regular shoes. Physical therapist recommend this style for my leg injuries. They usually Last around a year . This is my 4th pair no issues or unusual wear.,5,1,17
Bought this as my second pair of AX 3 hiking shoes. I bout the blue pair from a different seller and they fit perfect. Ordered these in the same size and the toe is extremely tight. My feet are always warm so I like room for them to breath. The blue pair is great this pair not so much. Would love to return for a half size bigger but I wore them outside right away as I figured they were the same size as my other pair so there shouldn’t have been a problem.,3,0,17
"The shoes are really comfortable and the handled the terrain well. Toes were protect when stubbing foot on rocks. The soles/tread protected the bottom of my feet when walking over jagged rocks. The bad thing is that the top area developed a rip after only 3.5 miles of hiking. Praying that I still have the Amazon return bag, so I can exchange them or get a refund.",1,0,17
The AX2 has always been my favorite Adidas shoe. I walk parking lots for work and have been wearing these shoes for 5 years. Excellent cushioning with Continental sole and heel.,5,1,17
"I am an ADIDAS guy, love the brand......this shoe however is by far the most uncomfortable shoe I have ever worn......these shoes, sadly, are horrible.....very disappointing. Still love ADIDAS, but a big miss with this pair.",1,0,17
"These hiking shoes did the job! I’m a size 12 and got them wide. First time buying hiking gear, took them to Capital Reef National Park and they were comfortable all day. Also, the grip on these is great! Didn’t slip once. I had a few people tell me I should’ve gotten boots for the ankle support but that problem never really came up for me.",5,1,17
I like these shoes. I’ve only warn them around town a few times to break them in but they are comfortable and I’ve experienced no discomfort. I am going on a hiking trip soon and look forward to wearing them. I’ll update this review if I experience issues but I don’t anticipate I will at this time. Worthwhile purchase as far as I can tell.,5,1,17
"Good fit, consistent good adidas/terex quality. Ive had this pair close to 2 months, and the tread on the bottom is showing significant wear. That being said, i avg'd 4.75mi/day for a total of nearly 300mi of on foot time and these were on my feet for most of it. Would prob last longer if not on concrete/asphalt. Its a big price for a few months of wear. Would make good shoes for as intended use.",3,0,17
"This was the second pair I tried to buy. First pair featured a half size too small fit. This pair was the correct sizing. Both pairs however, go figure, the left foot board, sole, whatever you call it, sloped to the left ! The sole of the left shoe allowed the ankle to bend. Never seen or felt anything like it. Some sort of manufacturing defect. Other wise the shoe was of fine quality, liked the styling, color and the cleat like soles as I planned on golfing in them.",2,0,17
"What others have said about the heel is true, your foot just doesn’t seem snug back there. Just did a 7.2 mile hike with them and It’s not a bad shoe but it wasn’t an all that comfortable ride. Sturdy sole but there’s a lack of cushioning where it counts. Spend more money and get something that’ll keep your feet happier",3,0,17
A little disappointed as they are not waterproof as advertised. The moment I stepped into a puddle that went over the bottom of the shoe water seeped into the mesh. They are comfortable and the look i wanted but you would be better off getting full leather boots for true waterproof protection.,3,0,17
Any water that comes down from above (e.g. rain) will go right through the top mesh. The reviews on this site are totally misleading and incorrect. The shoes fit great. They grip great. They look good. They are not waterproof though. I don't often write reviews.,3,0,17
"It was stated that these shoes are water resistant, but they are far from it. I got juice on them a day after they arrived, and went to spray them off quickly, and the half second they got water on toes, it soaked in inside of shoe. Definitely wouldn’t take them hiking if any chance of getting wet.",2,0,17
"Got these for the reviews and here to add another great one. These have great soles and the support is there. Very durable and protective, yet light and not wearing ya down.

Played 15 rounds so far in these and did about 30 miles of hiking and they feel brand need still.",5,1,17
I’m usually an 11.5-12 but with a 12 these are too small. Order 1/2 size up if you want them. For a 12.5 the price jumps from 59.00-120$ so no dice returned them.,1,0,17
"Good shoe. I added better inserts and not the biggest fan of how the tongue lays. With that said, the quality is good, they look great, and the cost is very low. I typically wear Keen, Merrel, etc. but am happy I got these for half the cost.",4,1,17
"I have been buying Merrill hiking shoes for 15 years but to me their quality has decreased and the price has increased. Thought I would try these Adidas and I am glad I did,. The seams and sowing are tight, the soles give great traction. The look is great and the fit was perfect. Will see how the water proof works in the next rain.",5,1,17
"I took these on a trip to Europe walking through snow, ice, slush, puddles etc and they were absolutely superb! Very comfortable, warm (but not sweaty), and stylish. The grip level on these things is insane, I walked on ice covered roads as if my shoes were glued to the ground. Overall, worth every penny!",5,1,17
"Me gustan mucho. Me los puse con esta medias blancas que no cuadran mucho pero aún así se ven calidad!!! Ayer me metí por un monte, una selva una vegetación y subí por unas montañas de tierra que estaban ahí y fino!! No me resbale ni nada. Te los recomiendo a milllll",5,1,17
These are great for trails and being out in the wild for being more active than just a hiking boot. The upside to me is they have really great breathe ability and weight compared to a boot. I’ve worn adidas for years and know my sizes so I didn’t have to worry about returns. Shoe feels great and just like all my other adidas performs above expectations!,5,1,17
"Adidas were always the shoe that fit best, but this has a strange problem--the shoe presses my big toes in.

My son tried them and found they tilted his foot oddly.",2,0,17
"Well for last 10 years adidas ran 1 size small, Of course after i order these 1 size big they are big. Order the size u normally are. These are tge ONLY adidas on earth sized correctly.",4,1,17
"Fit like they were supposed to. Comfortable off the bat, even served as decent non-slips for professional kitchen work. I don’t know that they are rated as appropriate non-slips for kitchen work but they did really well. Pretty functional shoe, I even wear them while doing basic errands",5,1,17
My usual size was completely unwearable because of how narrow the toe box is. Crushed my big toe sideways. The shape of the sole is like a pointy dress shoe.,2,0,17
Still trying to break them in. They really seem to fatigue my feet on a normal 10000 step day. Not sure how they will hold up backpacking and on trails and rocks. Don’t like them as much as my Walk DMX. Hoping they do fine when I get the broken in a little better. Not my favorite right out of the box,3,0,17
Bought them for my son who works in a mechanic shop all day. Standing on concrete for 10 hrs a day. These definitely helped provide better support and have been a more durable shoe vs what he had before.,5,1,17
This show is not waterproof. The webbed part that covers the top of your foot leaks like crazy. I got caught in a rainstorm and my feet and socks were soaked,1,0,17
"it was intend for the bike cycling and I did have some soreness after each bike ride and decided walk on them for a day, wel these shoe are so uncomfortable and giving them to a second hand store, because the returns of the shoe has expire. I did find a pair of Asics from Dick Sporting Goods which work better",5,1,17
Very good soles. My favourite waking and hiking shoes. I generally walk on uneven and sometimes rocky terrain. You can also wear it as a casual shoe for the weekend or even work.,5,1,17
I daily use these so they barely hit the trail. Plenty of traction in the yard and any loose substrate. The bottom resembles an off road tire tread. It says Continental on the bottom which is a manufacturer of tires so my guess is their R&D went into the design. As an automotive enthusiast and mechanic I think that's pretty cool.,5,1,17
"If he likes them, so will you. They're strong, comfortable for long days on your feet, and look decent. And the price is great for comparable shoes. Will be ordering a backup pair.",5,1,17
This is my husband’s Second pair of these. He loves them. He does landscaping and tree work so it is convenient to have a durable shoe With traction.,5,1,17
"I wear custom orthotics and it is important for my shoes to have a stiff shank. Without the stiff shank, there is not enough support from my orthotics and I have ankle pain. The stiff shank on this shoe allows me to walk all day without ankle pain. I love this shoe!",5,1,17
"Great shoe. I wanted to start out with that the look is amazing. The shoes are built strong and fit great! Once I put on the shoes I realize that these are going to be one of my favorite for all walking situation and I walk a lot! So far, they have been perfect for me.",5,1,17
One of the best all terrain shoes I have had. They felt perfect straight out the box. No need to break them in. Even after a day of hiking my feet felt great. Put your hiking boots on the shelf and replace them with these. You can’t get better quality for the price.,5,1,17
Love the quality. One fits better than the other but that my personal situation. Great look and more sturdy than you’re basic sneaker. Aggressive tread and is great for inclement weather.,5,1,17
"They are great boots I work in a warehouse, 12-14 hours shift, this boots are so comfortable definitely recommend for long walks",5,1,17
I don't like to buy shoes too often but I needed a good light-weight hiking shoe and these were perfect. I did about a 6-mile hike in these and they did a great job. I even accidentally got them dirty in a patch of mud but was able to easily clean them off after my hike. I also wear these as I would any other shoe- sure they are a little bulkier than a normal shoe but just a comfortable and do a better job at keeping my sock dry when I get stuck walking in the rain.,5,1,17
"These shoes were very uncomfortable to begin with. It took about a week to get them broken in. The pressure point was on top of the toes where the shoe would flex & fold down into my foot. With that said, they’re very comfortable now & wear them daily.",4,1,17
"My 1st pair of Terrex was a costco purchase for a deal on a wook shoe. Turned out to the best work shoe i have ever had so bought another pair, disappointed to find they are narrow when the size show 10.5 M you would assume medium width like my last pair. This pair is slightly smaller and no markings i can tell on the width. Great shoe but beware of the sizing.",4,1,17
"Out of the box they were comfortable. After much walking and a little riding off-road they have held up, and retained their comfort and support. They provide great traction, especially in mud (as long as it doesn't go up past your ankle lols). They are a little hot and heavy, but they are low-top so that's not too bad either. I would not hesitate to buy another pair, but I feel these have a couple more seasons in them.",5,1,17
Great everyday shoe! I work in maintenance and hike put in 14+ miles a day in all kinds of weather/terrain and absolutely love the feel holding up great very water resistant the grip is much more aggressive than it looked like to me in the photos but still smooth on paved surfaces and really great walking trails or grass hills will absolutely be buying again if they keep producing them,5,1,17
It was so hard felt like a brick.... And the size is bigger! Disappointed by the description and the material.,1,0,17
"I thought the issues were nice, I didn't have any problems with them. They're very padded in my opinion which I wasn't really expecting, but that's nice if you're going to be hiking for a long time.",4,1,17
"The shoes did not last very long. I do walk a lot, took them on vacation to Greece. They wore out for me on the heels, very fast. I would not buy them again.",2,0,17
"Bought these because I needed new shoes to use on a daily basis that are waterproof and that would also be good for hiking. I've been using mine for about a month now and they still look exactly like new! They are very resistant and confortable to use. The hard sole makes it also ideal to walk in rocky soil or uneven surfaces. It might be a bit hard at first use, but becomes a bit more flexible in a few days. Strongly recommend if you want something for outdoor activities.",5,1,17
Wearing these shoes really hurt my arches. Not satisfied with how they feel.,1,0,17
I got these shoes for light outside activities. After wearing them for 2 days the back of the shoe is coming off! I have not been tough on them at all! Would hoping they were going to last at least a little longer than 2 days but I guess not.,2,0,17
Need to be broken in. They are still a little tight on top off the foot. Once broken in they are great. I am a mover so it’s important what’s on my feet. These are great bc I can wear them all day and they are sturdy and waterproof keeping my feet dry and supporting my foot. It’s like a boot in a shoe but not quite as comfy as a sneaker. I’d def recommend them to a friend.,5,1,17
First pair of shoes I purchased on Amazon that absolutely didn't fit. I went a half-size larger and still way too small. And I could tell the shoe would be uncomfortable even if they did fit. Very firm - no cushion.,2,0,17
"Bought these for a trip to Colorado. It just so happen to be snowing when we got to the resort in the mountains. They were used in the snow keep my feet dry. We drove to Utah. I went on a hike at a national park, the shoes worked really well keeping you from sliding when climbing up inclines are going down declines.",5,1,17
Best shoes for hills or any slippery place where a sure foot is necessary. This is my second pair after owning the ax2.,5,1,17
I bought these shoes for easy hiking when I don't want to wear my hiking boots. They are nice looking and good for street wear. I like that they have a sole with good grip. I wore them for a small hike and they were not comfortable..,4,1,17
Love the comfort of these shoes. They do run small so I would suggest to go up one size. Most of the time I wear a size 12 but with these I get a size 13. This is my 4th pair of these since I wore the 1st two pairs out and I wanted a different color.,5,1,17
"Hi
Quality construction, fit well and have a great grip. Wide base for more stability. Compared to a sneaker they are a bit heavier than sneakers, but worth it. Very nice price.",5,1,17
"I have a pair of the AX2s, which were wonderful. I ordered the exact same size and these were waaaaaaay smaller. Like at least a whole size smaller. How about some consistently Adidas???",1,0,17
Very poor quality after 3 months of mild use the shoes are coming apart at the seem. Very poor quality upper but the grip is amazing.,1,0,17
The out look is very beautiful BUT the outsole and the midsole of this shoes is very hard. So I wear it like two days and it started hurting my feet.,3,0,17
Nice rigid upper. Materials are quality and has nice cushion. I'm between a regular and wide fit so it can be tough to find the right width. These fit perfectly in regular.,4,1,17
"Just picked these up and fit is on point. Am a guy 9.5M

Quality seems nice also",4,1,17
"These are the best and most comfortable shoes, I have ever owned. I have a shoe size difference, between my actual feet. It is really hard for me to find shoes that actually fit comfortably. Adidas brand knows how to make their 1/2 sizes fit correctly!",5,1,17
"The outer edges of these have worn away faster than the rest of the sole, causing my foot to slant more and creat more of an issue, my foot feels unstable. Very tight in the beginning but did loosen up a little over time.
Good seller, no problems there.",2,0,17
"I bought these for my son, and he says that are just what he wanted. Unexpected bonus, apparently they are also waterproof. Very comfortable. Quality made hiking shoe. Buy this.",5,1,17
"Ideal for long hikes and airport travel. They can totally handle rainstorms and snow, although you'll lose grip on the snow. Cold temperatures are not a problem around 0°C, anything less and you'll feel it.",5,1,17
Bought these for my 12 year old son. They fit perfect and are so well made. They are should at least last him a year!,5,1,17
They are comfortable and airy because of the mesh. The breath-ability of the shoe makes them cool. They have support so far that seems to be good so far. A very nice walking shoe.,5,1,17
Very comfortable shoe. Had some from costco just like these but could never find them again. Glad I found them on Amazon because they’re very comfortable.,5,1,17
Fits just right and comfortable very aggressive sole good traction Wet N Dry surfaces would buy again. Purchase this shoe to use while riding my mountain bike works well.,5,1,17
Comfortable shoes. No issues just as described. Simply put they’re shoes and they’re comfortable.,5,1,17
Wanted to like them but they are too tight in the toe area. Seem to be well made otherwise. I like how they look too which is why I bought them but I don’t wear uncomfortable shoes.,3,0,17
Picked up a pair to replace old disc golf shoes and I love them. Great ankle support without being obstructive. The treads have good grip but also seem like they'll last.,5,1,17
"I was hopeful that these shoes would last me at least a year. Alas, almost a month to the day later, the sole is already beginning to separate. Thoroughly disappointed. I hadn't even put many miles on it yet, primarily wearing it to work where I have spent a majority of my time in the office.",1,0,17
"I have a fairly narrow & flat foot, Adidas fit really well & give me that desired arch support w/out being too intense. Still breaking them in but after one over night camping trip & one hike, they’re just about good to go.",5,1,17
"For the price I don’t think you’ll find better shoes

Comfortable supportive and grip well

I added speed laces (non tie) which makes a big difference",5,1,17
The shoes fit and feel great. The tread is deep and aggressive. Great for muddy hikes. But the mud does stay stuck up in there when you come inside. The shoe string holes near the top are a bit odd. They do look clunky.,4,1,17
Have all these shoes for over a year that they're not my main shoe but they're very durable and still holding up,5,1,17
"I haven't broken the shoes down they are still stiff
Sofar they are good and they look durable",5,1,17
They are a bit stiff overall. Feels loose in the heel too. Overall I still really like them. Hoping they break in a bit more and I can probably add elastic laces to get a tighter fit at the ankle so the heel doesn't slip,4,1,17
The sole is too hard and inflexible and the heel cup is loose. No bueno!,2,0,17
Wear these for Disc Golf. They have good traction and are sturdy when you have to trek through the forest or high grass to find your errant Tee shot. The water resistance is also nice.,5,1,17
I am an absolute fan of Adidas Terrex. These are the most comfortable shoes. I highly recommend it.,5,1,17
It may feel a little snug but give it a few days of wearing and it will become perfect. I hiked 15 miles over a weekend and no regrets.,5,1,17
"Very good, but like other size 12D are a bit too wide. I really need “C” width, unfortunately not widely available.",4,1,17
"Shoes couldn't have been much worse the cushion under the foot itself is incredibly thin, the toe box is incredibly stiff so my toes just smash against the sides they dont feel like the shoes support my feet. my feet feel like they are insie a hard box. To put it simply im incredibly disappointed that even after a week of wearing them im still regretting my purchase... never again, you have been warned",1,0,17
I only where these when I'm playing disc golf and they are the best,5,1,17
Feet stayed dry on a very rainy hike in Oregon at Mirror Lake near Mt. Hood. Socks were even dry. Everybody I went went had soaked feet at the end of the hike.,5,1,17
"Comfortable, but won't last cheap materials and poor craftsmanship. Durability is 1 star.",3,0,17
"The sole is kinda hard, but I got used to it quick. It's kinda nice not to feel every pebble though. Light, hadn't tested waterproof yet, that's what boots are for. Quality seems to be above average.",5,1,17
"Firm sole for hilly hikes on loose rocky trails , aggressive tread design, toe and heal padding. Fits snug, so there will be a break-in period.",4,1,17
"If you have narrow a narrow toe box, these are too narrow for you. Weird... I know...",1,0,17
"Love these shoes!! Didn't fall all winter I live in the UP of Michigan we get 200+ inches of snow a year. Used for work mostly everyday carrying heavy objects in and out of homes. They do track more than normal amounts of snow in to the home due to the cleats. But we wear shoe covers in home.

Sick grip!",5,1,17
Runs a little small wears in after a few wears. Great construction,5,1,17
My second pair very pleased I’m in the car business I’m on my feet all day. Good arch support. In and out of cars all day were down the heel of the left foot. War wore uneven only reason for next pair.,5,1,17
Bought these to go out hiking in Colorado. Broken them in first noticed walking though taller dew grass my toes would get wet. Overall a great shoes the grip was great in the mountains and on trails. I would buy these again for sure!,5,1,17
When I first put them on they hurt where the crease as you walk forward would pinch where my toes began in shoe (mostly at the pinky toe) - but after a day or so they 'broke in' and everything bent/flexed properly. Very comfortable otherwise. I'd buy them again.,5,1,17
got this in the mail a few minutes ago and tried it on. Slides a little bit but still fits perfectly. I'm probably going to end up getting dr schols soles with these anyway. only will tell whether these actually hold or not. I hope they do since these are great looking shoes,5,1,17
"Fits good, could use a little more cusion in the soles, but my feet don't hurt after our hour walks 3 times a week.",5,1,17
Definitely met expectations for the great price. Extremely light and perfect for the trail.,5,1,17
"Great grip, good feel, not quite as light as I had hoped. Overall a very good shoe. I have worn them every day for a hike has been a few weeks already.",5,1,17
"At first I loved the shoes. But after a week or so they hurt like crazy! The toe end is so squished together. I got blisters on both feet. They also are not very ""water resistant."" Stopped wearing them already. Sad.",2,0,17
Well they are awesome shoes only if we received and left and a right shoe. We received 2 right shoes,3,0,17
Love the deep solid traction. Also lightweight and cool,5,1,17
"Bought these for my husband and he absolutely loves them. He liked to hike with dog along trails and these keep feet dry and have great traction for Florida ground. I had to return his usual size 11 for a 12, and fit perfect.",5,1,17
the soles of these shoes slant or slouch to the outside not allowing me to stand or walk in a neutral position. soles are thick on the inside and slant down to the outside. feels like im walking on my 5th metatarsal.,2,0,17
Good price and these are really sturdy well put together shoes.,5,1,17
great shoes for walking and home health Aide shoes comfortably,5,1,17
Fits great. Feels very durable with the Continental rubber sole which provides the super action traction for most all conditions. I'm going to order another pair for whenever this pair wears out.,5,1,17
Wear great! Look great! Would definitely recommend them.,5,1,17
product is good but to narrow for my foot.,5,1,17
"On a smaller side, hard/stiff, weird fit especially when standing on flat and even surface. Very uncomfortable.
Cannot recommend.",1,0,17
20+ year Adidas wearer and have been a size 12 for 90% of this time. Always fit. I also only buy Adidas for the more relaxed fit through the shoe. This pair were SO tight in the width behind the toes. My feet hurt for hours after wearing them. Returned.,1,0,17
My husband is on his feet 8-10 hrs always moving. These shoes are perfect for his job. He's got really bothersome feet.,5,1,17
"I bought this pair of shoes for trekking and walking. This shoe is the most uncomfortable I have ever owned! I tried it on a few times hoping to break in these shoes, but my feet would hurt, and I had to stop wearing them for fear of injury to my feet. Bad purchase - very disappointed",1,0,17
Perfect fit and looks awesome to on my feet,5,1,17
"These seemed great at first, but the price they did not last. After about 3 months of normal wear they are coming apart at the soles. Will likely not purchase another adidas product.",2,0,17
Great style and feel amazing on my feet. Although I haven't used them for hiking yet,5,1,17
"Comfortable, I like my shoes really tight but I can't do that with these because the padding between the laces and your foot is kind of thin so they dig into your foot. But I loosened them up and they're very comfortable. I walk 17+ miles a day at work and I'm very satisfied , they look really cool too.",4,1,17
Finally some shoes that last a while. These are sturdy yet comfortable,5,1,17
"Disappointed. Looks like amazing tread , with good grip. Unfortunately, I'd like Adidas to make them with a little bit more of a wiggle room for those who wear wool or different types of hiking socks. With regular ""thin"" socks they fit just fine.",2,0,17
"I received used shoes. The tips of the shoes show scratches, the inner heel cushioning is broken, and the soles are worn. I cannot return these items because they were shipped internationally from my mailbox in Miami.",1,0,17
"I never write a review for anything, but these shoes are GREAT! Last night, walking in a NYC thunderstorm my feet stayed dry! They are very comfortable, but most importantly . . . my feet stayed dry and I was out walking the dogs for at least an hour, Timberlands have never kept my feet dry! Anyway . . . this is my review!!!",5,1,17
This hiking shoes feels great! It is very comfortable and sturdy. You need to 1/2 size up. At least I had to. I love this shoes.,5,1,17
"was hoping for a little more cushion for hiking shoe, not bad.",3,0,17
Love this line of Adidas and have/had others. Look and feel great. Tough shoe for all seasons especially the long cold snowy winters where I live.,5,1,17
"It take few miles of hiking to breaking them in but love how they hold up any trails types and rocks .
I'm happy with them

Give them a try",5,1,17
"The style and design of these shoes are on point. I didn’t expect them to be as comfortable as they are, you can stand on ‘‘em all day. Perfect for disc golf because the rubber is super grippy. I got a second pair of these, favorite shoe by far.",5,1,17
These shoes are comfortable and have good traction for hiking. They are water resistant and keep your feet dry as you walk through small puddles or wet grass.,5,1,17
"Recently started hiking seriously and these shoes were the right pick. They fit perfectly, weigh practically nothing, and let me walk on slopes that I never thought I'd be able to.",5,1,17
Horrible fit. Something inside the shoes kept rubbing and digging into my foot.,1,0,17
Fell apart in 3 months,1,0,17
"It fits, next time I’ll see if they have it in wide. Too early to tell the durability. They’re wearing a bit after 50k steps (all concrete).",5,1,17
Sin algo pesaditos pero es lo que se espera de un zapato tan resistente..Buena compra,5,1,17
Bought these for an outdoor trip for a week. Hiked and went through trails with ease as they were very comfortable. I tried similar shoes at an Adidas outlet to compare sizes and true enough going with a larger size works. These shoes feel durable and look stylish. Definitely work the money.,5,1,17
shoe laces don't stay tied unless you double knot them...disappointing,5,1,17
"The shoes look good, and felt pretty good except for the area by the heel. For whatever reason, on both shoes, the area where your inner heel rests has a hard piece of insole or something that causes blisters after wearing the shoes for a short time.",2,0,17
These are my husband's favorite shoes! He has a permanently injured ankle and he can wear these with no discomfort.,5,1,17
"It felt like I was walking out of the shoe with every step. I customize my lacing patterns, but it didn't seem to matter.",1,0,17
Had high hopes for these being good work shoes in the summer as an alternative to boots. They didn't last 4 months. So disappointed in the quality.,5,1,17
Overall I like the quality and look.,4,1,17
The heel is a bit loose.It had a white stain on one of the shoes.Great color.Great Texture.Needs time to get used to your feet.,4,1,17
It is not comfortable.,1,0,17
As described.,4,1,17
Child loves them,5,1,17
too small 8.5 u.s is my size but these don't fit. walk ins are always better you don't have to deal with this returning crap,2,0,17
I replaced a set of Nike trail running shoes with these for hiking and mountain biking. I'm a flat paddle rider and appreciate the stiffness of the sole on these.,5,1,17
"Don't waste your time. These shoes have zero arch support and the sole feels like you're walking on concrete. They look cool, but that's about it.",2,0,17
"Adidas always run small in their sizing, keep that in mind. After putting some miles on these I can say I love them. Comfortable, great traction, great weight, didn’t hold water when they got wet. Would absolutely purchase again.",5,1,17
These shoes are perfect for disc golf. They fit pretty close to exact size. Nice tread. Not too heavy.,5,1,17
I have a narrow foot and find this shoe fit me very well. Almost water proof and easy to clean. My heal has been a little sore since wearing this shoe daily on pavement for my job.,5,1,17
Great fit and look!,5,1,17
"They are comfortable, light, But not really water resistant. Took me a week or two to discover that. Disappointing.",3,0,17
It’s tough to buy “fitted” items online but when you follow the size chart and order a larger size and still the product is too small? Lame. The bonus is I have to pay for the return despite following the size chart? Two thumbs down.,1,0,17
Love these shoes for hiking. Perfect when you need good grip but don’t want a boot.,5,1,17
Got one pair for my wife and one for myself ... couldn't be happier with MY decision to get those 😍,5,1,17
"These things are awesome, plenty of tread, fit like other adidas. Nothing bad to say.",5,1,17
Todo bien,5,1,17
I have a few keens and merrell shoes that cost double what these did and I prefer these over them. Heavier than running shoes but solid platform for hiking or working in all day,5,1,17
Price was awesome,5,1,17
Great durable shoe.,5,1,17
I'd like to know how I can stretch one of the shoes wider? I should get a refund due to the mis-representation,2,0,17
I use these at work and I am walk more than 8 miles a day. They are the best shoes I have used.,5,1,17
"Good air of shoes, the last pair they are replacing lasted over 6 years. These seem to be an equal quality",5,1,17
"They look great and feel nice. Bought for 11 year son, size 6. I could hear him stomping around the hard wood floor.",4,1,17
Comfortable and made well..,5,1,17
Very Good,5,1,17
"Very comfortable, fits as expected. For the casual hiker, this shoe is great.",5,1,17
I love these shoes and use them for for everything from work to hiking. Very comfortable and look great. I have worn them to work with dress pants and the actually don’t look out of place. Great shoes and very versatile!,5,1,17
My husband is on his feet all day in a management position and this shoe lasts and lasts and his feet never hurt when he wears them.,5,1,17
It’s a very comfortable shoe that fits as expected. It is only waterproof to an extent. I wore to a sporting event that was in a heavy rainfall and eventually the shoes leaked through leaving my socks soaking wet. They definitely work well in cold weather with the insulated feature. Just don’t get wet,4,1,17
These are nice. Better than the pictures. So durable. These are premium! Not going to find something better-these are great!,5,1,17
"The hiker is comfortable and provides good support. It is light weight and looks good, unlike a lot of the clunky hiking boots. Seems to be well made and durable.",5,1,17
"Even though they seem a little narrow, they are quite comfortable, and support quite well. I would have given a 5 star rating if they had been available in a wide width. I have had them for only one week, but they seem to be built very well.",5,1,17
Been hiking in these shoes for a couple of months. Just as I broke them in and was really enjoying them the heal cup area wore a hole through the fabric on the interior of the shoe. This wore a blister on my heal. Cannot wear them anymore. Only happened on the left shoe. Right one seems to be ok.,4,1,17
They are really comfortable and light weight. I like them so much I ordered a second pair.,5,1,17
They feel great. Easy to break in. The traction is aggressive enough for trails but I can still wear them to the gym. Hope they last awhile.,5,1,17
"very comfortable and resistant, I use them to work and I feel comfortable and my feet are protected. The sole is very resistant to uneven ground",5,1,17
"About as expected from a cheaper hiking shoe. Not the most cushioned shoe, but ok. Fit was about as expected, maybe a tad smaller than regular 9.5m",4,1,17
"I ordered a half size up. It was a little too big around the heel at first, but as you move and warm up your feet actually expand. So within 30 minutes of my 10 mile hike, they felt perfect. Light weight and comfortable. Wouldn't recommend for walking on mostly asphalt or concrete with these, but for dirt tracks they felt great.",5,1,17
"I do a lot of walking on and off road. They were at first not comfortable on hard roads but over time felt great

Love the style and look. They are very comfortable even after 100’s of miles I’ve already walked in them. Very durable. Great price for what you get.",4,1,17
Nothin to not like so far.,5,1,17
"Very good but much lower quality than terrex swift r2 and you you a half size more. I always wear size 13 even other terrex shoe, with this one 13 feel little tight.",3,0,17
"Great soes , not just for Hiking even for every day wear, they are very Comfortable and looks very good , very well made and very lasting",5,1,17
MUY BUENOS ZAPATOS EXACTOS A LA MEDIDA Y DE GRAN CALIDAD,5,1,17
Awesome shoes for the trail waterproof lightweight great support I love these Adidas,5,1,17
"Comfortable, high quality",5,1,17
Bought these for use at work in the automotive industry. Tough and keep my feet safe and cool. Will buy again but in black.,5,1,17
"I'm curious what the life expectancy of these shoes is. I've had them for about a month (35 days), and the soles are already junk. Different treads on each shoe are now completely flat. I know these are inexpensive, but I'm floored at how cheap the soles are. These will be useless after 6 weeks of use. Pathetic.",2,0,17
Great shoes for hiking. Very sturdy and not too heavy. Very comfortable,5,1,17
"Comfortable but I still by them a half size larger so I can use soft sole inserts in them. I do that with all my shoes and boots though.
Nice looking also.",5,1,17
These shoes are great around the farm. They are lightweight but sturdy enough to hold up to tough conditions. The added traction is awesome you just have to remember you're likely tracking mud with you. Easily my favorite work shoes.,5,1,17
"On wet ground, they are extremely slippery!! Would not purchase again.",2,0,17
Nice sneaker - and it’s waterproof,5,1,17
Great fitting shoe very comfortable.,4,1,17
My husband bought these. Comfortable true to size and they’re water proof,5,1,17
Great shoe if you use inserts. The shoe is basically flat and allows you to insert specialty insert for high arches.,5,1,17
"Terrible for walking in, I walk 6-8 hrs a day for work and they grip well for when I’m in grass or dirt but are extremely uncomfortable on concrete. Using Dr. Scholl’s the comfortability only goes from a 1 to a 2/5. Definitely for hiking, probably lol!",2,0,17
Comfortable. Takes a few days to break in to.,5,1,17
"Great hiking shoes and very stylish as well.
Very comfortable even from day 1",5,1,17
"I really liked them! Well built shoe. Seemed durable. Just very narrow fit, like all Adidas.",5,1,17
Waiting until the season begins then I will be back to report,5,1,17

"Feet hurt. Too narrow. Strange back design, very very uncofortable.",1,0,17
I bought for hiking but found it works great as a Mt biking and golf shoe.,5,1,17

Deben mejorar la calidad,2,0,17
Casual,5,1,17
"I really like these shoes! I needed a pair of shoes that could keep the cold out but was still lightweight for fall/winter. These are perfect for that. Now when its a little chilly or wet out. I can throw these on rather then my normal shoes or my heavy boots. Great fit, comfortable. Thanks",5,1,17
"I have had a couple pairs of these and they are very comfortable and durable. I like them because they are great for walking but since they are all black can also pass for semi dress shoes. So, when I travel, I can get away with one pair of shoes.",5,1,17
"Fit great, very light and plenty of grip. Wore these in the snow and they did surprisingly well at keeping my feet warm and dry",5,1,17
"Great fit, they look awesome and have great grip. Where I would usually be slipping walking through trails I was able to get through confidently",5,1,17
"These shoes fit great, the are light weight, have a tough sole which makes them great for hiking, and walking through all different types of terrain. Even bought some for my girlfriend and she is picky when it comes to shoes. Would recommend them to anyone.",5,1,17
addidas let me down. both shoes fit different. very stiff .very heavy. just dont buy them,1,0,17
I see that these run a bit big for my feet. I am a female who likes to wear male tennis shoes more than females.,4,1,17
Used these one time. They fit true to size (maybe a TINY BIT big) and were comfortable but started falling apart after a short day hike....returned them!,2,0,17
Fit well,5,1,17
Order 1 size larger that u wear!,5,1,17
Show is great but color is all black description does not say that,3,0,17
The tongue of the shoe is way to thick they could do better.,2,0,17
I used this product for work and hiking and I like that it is made of a durable material and water resistant,5,1,17
Great looking shoe. Fits awesome.,5,1,17
"Look good, nice shoes for the price, looking forward to hiking in them. The right shoe’s tongue doesn’t sit right and rubs into the top of the foot. Semi uncomfortable but you get used to it. And for the price, expected some minor discomfort. Not the softest soles either.",3,0,17
Esta muy bueno pero es para un regalo,5,1,17
Will not fit,2,0,17
Fit great wear them all day at work. More comfortable and last longer than Salomons. Very breathable shoe.,5,1,17
I got good deal during the Christmas time from Amazon.Adidas shoe fit perfect and good quality.,5,1,17
"Tell customers to order a half size larger than normal as these shoes are running on the small side. If not, their toes will be hitting the end of the shoe. I normal order 10 to 10-1/2, so I ordered the 10-1/2 and they are short.",4,1,17
"Very comfortable and is not a high top, nice looking.",5,1,17
"went over roots and rocks they did great, very stiff soles great for hiking. No slipping.",5,1,17
Not waterproof but it fits very nice,5,1,17
These were made with better materials than my previous Terrex shoes... the soles are better on these and they're lasting longer.,5,1,17
This is a good pair of shoes though it is a little too stiff/sturdy after my taste.,5,1,17
los zapatos llegaron sin demora y segun la talla descrita,5,1,17
My husband is extremely happy with these shoes.,5,1,17
These are very good quality and feel extremely durable. The design is nice and the have a sporty profile when your wearing them.,5,1,17
I got these for a backpacking trip across Kentucky. I broke them in for a couple weeks before the trip and continued to wear them after. Very comfortable and solid design/construction. They don’t look like hiking shoes but are very sturdy.,5,1,17
"The shoe is great ,comfortable the only problem is not true to size. I normally wear 11had to return and get a 12. Very durable shoe.",5,1,17
These shoes are not durable. I bought a pair that lasted 7 months with light wear. I only wore them around the yard. Never hiked with the. While every thing else was good about the shoe if it doesn’t last then it not much good,1,0,17
I could barely fit this narrow shoe on my foot...even though it was a half size larger than I usually wear. Nice looking shoe though.,1,0,17
"Mostly black, great grip. I’m a fan of continental tires, so I’m expecting the soles to perform well.",5,1,17
very very small and uncomfortable seemed like a half size or more. they looked real nice but my feet hurt even a day after I returned them,2,0,17
The shoes are tight up top but extremely loose at heel. My heels almost come completely out when walking.,2,0,17
"These are the best, most versatile show ever! Between work and play it’s hard to find the time out to switch shoes. Won’t have to with these!",5,1,17
Very sturdy shoes with plenty of traction.,4,1,17
Great shoes and I had no issues...BTW my first hiking experiences.,5,1,17
The shoe runs small so watch out. I had to return mine and they didn’t have a bigger size in stock so I never got to wear it but it seemed like a really good shoe.,4,1,17
Perfect work shoes for my husband,5,1,17
They are really comfortable shoes,5,1,17
Ordered size 9 and it is very tight. I have previously had the x2 with no size issue so a little surprised with this one.,2,0,17
My new favorite shoes. I wear them everywhere. So comfortable.,5,1,17
"Walked on these all day, and my feet still felt amazing! Can't be the price as well!",5,1,17
i dont want any product from china. they dont fit and they are cheaply made,1,0,17
Waterproof. I love the color. And the price was right. I had the gortex big brother of these shoes before but didn't love the paracord laces. These are just as nice and actually I find them more comfortable.,5,1,17
Comfy. I use them for trail walking during disc golf rounds. Perfect for slightly wet mornings,5,1,17
"bought a pair of these a year ago and held up quite well, this recent pair already has worn through the inside heel after two weeks, and yes they are the correct size. granted i put a ton of miles on them, but the quality has not impressed with the new pair. wont buy them again.",2,0,17
Perfect fit and great traction. Will definitely buy again.,5,1,17
"Fit perfectly, grade tread. These will be nice trail shoes!",5,1,17
I started walking trail and my regular shoes were to soft and thin i felt every rock and root. These shoes eliminated that problem!,5,1,17
"These shoes did exactly what they were supposed to, and gave me a comfortable hiking experience even through rough terrain all day.",5,1,17
"Excelente producto. Son muy cómodos, buena calidad, la talla es la que uno espera, es decir en mi caso 10 americano y quedo perfecta.",5,1,17
Great shoe for trails and MTB.,5,1,17

"These are great non-slip work shoes, highly reccommend",5,1,17

The water resistance is better than anticipated. I bought these for hiking and playing disc golf and I am super happy with them!,5,1,17
"loved my first pair so much that i ordered another 1 week later. great price. fit perfectly (something i worry about when ordering online and not being able to try them on). comfortable. great quality. delivered to korea with no customs/tariffs issues. and delivered fast, even without rush ordering. highly recommend these shoes to anyone.",5,1,17
These shoes are great! Not too bulky but robust to take on tal with confidence,5,1,17
AAA+,5,1,17
Had to wear them in but perfect once they were. As expected fits like normal adidas shoes,4,1,17

"nice boots, just too narrow for me",3,0,17
"I like everything in this shoes, love Adidas. Happy with my order.",5,1,17
"Great shoes, but they scuff REALLY easily",5,1,17
These shoes are nicely made however they are not comfortable at all. I’ve been wearing them for two days and I’m not impressed with them. The bottoms are so hard they make your feet and back hurt like crazy. The heel is a little loose but the rest of the shoe is super tight,2,0,17
"I would not recommend this shoe. It was very stiff and where the shoe bends, puts the crease uncomfortably on the upper side of your foot.",1,0,17
This shoe is awesome. Ordered them because I needed a new pair and because I love Adidas. Looking forward to ordering more this week!,5,1,17
"I've purchased other Adidas Terrex shoes in the past, however, during the first hike with these shoes, the toe on these started to separate from the rest of the body.",2,0,17
Got these for work. Not too heavy but strong enough for a full day. No slipping issues.,5,1,17
I want to like these so badly. Unfortunately they just aren’t overly comfy and after just a couple weeks of use they are coming apart. Wouldn’t be able to recommend these honestly.,1,0,17

Great shoes,5,1,17
"Fit, color, and comfort all meet my expectations. I would purchase these shoes again.",5,1,17
Shoes fit well in the size I ordered look great. I would buy again.,5,1,17
I ordered these on sale for the holiday and normally wear 11.5 in all my other Adidas sneakers. These were short and my toes hit the tip. I returned them and of course they went to full price and were out of stock on the size 12. Otherwise they seemed well made.,3,0,17
The fit is perfect and comfortable. They have more tread on the bottom than a regular gym shoe but surprisingly still lightweight. Happy with my purchase and defintely would buy again.,5,1,17
Bought for my husband love them. Had for hiking trip.,5,1,17
Great shoes that fit as expected and they are very comfortable. I've had them about a month now and they have been just what I wanted.,5,1,17
My husband love the shoes they a little to heavy as we expect but for the price was a good option. The size was a little to small so I recommend to buy one size up,5,1,17
"Very nice appearance.
Nice fit. Im sure I'll be as happy as i have been with all the Adidas footwear.",4,1,17
"These are great shoes. This is my second pair. Good for getting wet, hiking, walking, etc.",5,1,17
"Lover everything about them! I’m buying 3 more, they fit perfect, light weight and super durable! I have a slight wide foot and they fit perfect! Extremely happy!",5,1,17
These are well made very comfortable and perfect grip for disc golf.....,5,1,17
This shoe is ok.. it's a little bit wider than expected it works well as a work shoe.. not very fashionable for casual use,3,0,17

"I have been purchasing this style of Adidas slides from stores, for numerous years. The last pair were made in Italy, and were consistent in quality with those previously purchased. This latest purchase was the first time I have acquired them on line. These were made in China and are clearly made of lesser quality materials. They are much less weighty, and as such are less comfortable, and do not provide the cushion support of those purchased in stores. Being lighter in weight might be perceived as a benefit, but not at the expense of losing the support of a more quality made slide that carries the Adidas brand name. Price was not an advantage in this purchase either. While there are more costly slides available, the price to value ratio of those, are no better than these. Questionable also if P/V of these is a reason to purchase them.",3,0,17
Runs small! If you are a ladies size 9 these will not fit you! Often Adidas run big but these do not! My daughter wears a 7.5-8 and these fit perfect! They are not spongy they are the all rubber that has zero cushion anywhere! I ordered the 7 in men’s..,5,1,17
"I generally prefer Adidas to Nike or Under Armo(u)r becuase 1. I have flat feet and 2. the prices are reasonable. I'll keep these for now until I find something else, but it might be time to drop slides off my Adidas brand list. These feel like youre walking on tennis balls. Maybe they have to be broken in a bit, but the structure of these slides is very unusual to me (pertaining to the large lump in the sole).

Oh well, I suppose you get what you pay for.

Edit: After a day, i'm used to the lump and its not that bad. I still find it strange though",4,1,17
"I bought these to replace some older Adidas Cloudfoam slides that started deteriorating after 3 years. These run a size too small, so definitely recommend to size up. I normally wear 9.5 for Adidas shoes, but ordered a 10 on these and they fit. These are definitely of lower quality, but it is expected considering the price.",4,1,17
"I wasn't looking for much. Just something to put on my feet that wasn't terribly uncomfortable when walking in the garage. At $13.00 the price was right, but the quality was somehow worse than I knew was possible. I'm not even sure if these contain rubber. It feels like plastic, and there is no give when you're foot is in it. Also they were a bit tight even though I ordered my usual size.

Really not sure how they messed this one up. If you're looking for something casual to wear out and about, keep looking. If you're looking for something for the shower or to take out the garbage that you don't mind losing at some point, honestly, just go hit up a Marshall's or Walmart. I bought some basic Adidas slippers for around the same price, and the difference in quality is crazy.",1,0,17
"I swear I don’t even think my feet know what real shoes are anymore. Tired of wearing cheap dollar store knock offs. Don’t judge LOL. I decided to splurge and buy the real deal.

Supportive, definitely sturdy, waterproof, comfortable, do your feet a favor and just invest. Buying five dollar knock offs every few months adds up to the money will supportive, definitely sturdy, waterproof, comfortable, do your feet a favor and just invest. Buying five dollar knock offs every few months adds up to the price you spend 1x
And something tells me these will last at least a year. But then again I’m pretty rough on my slides LOL and summer is coming !

Definitely invest, I wear a size 9 women’s so I bought a size 7 in men’s and they fit beautifully. And my friends don’t make fun of me anymore!",4,1,17
"I am a fan of the Adilette series of Adidas sandals. The cloudfoam is better than the solarsoft by Nike, in my opinion. These shower sandals feel harder than the ultra cushiony Adilette comfort sandals, so be sure to pay attention to that detail. These are made to get wet, the comfort ones are not. These are a great pair of pool/beach sandals. The fit is a little tighter around the strap across the foot; less forgiving than the comfort style version - but you should still order your true shoe size.",5,1,17
"When these were first made available in the U.S. (1980s) they were all the rage with my fellow athletes. They were super comfortable and extremely durable. You could spend all day in them! Now they're just cheap plastic, not the denser, more ""rubbery"" feel of the old models. The arch support is so high that they actually hurt my arches to wear them. The old ones also used to have a thin, cloth liner under the strap that made them extremely comfortable to wear. That's gone now. I wore these out to run errands for about 2 hours and only walked in and out of a few stores. The strap dug into the top of my foot so badly that I couldn't wear any shoes for three days. This used to be the most comfortable slipper on the planet. Now it feels like just another piece of cheap, Chinese junk.",1,0,17
"These waterproof slides are my go-to for any outdoor activity. They are so convenient to slip on. I like the pattern and brand logo on the side. They offer wonderful support and are super comfy. I think they are remarkably durable. They fit as expected. I normally wear a size 10 in Womens. I tested out a 7 and an 8 and liked the 7 better. It offered a more secure yet roomy enough kind of fit. I can see these making for a wonderful gift, especially for college students using dorm showers, any supremely active people as well as just anyone in general. I bought them in Black and Gray and ended up returning the Gray because they didn't really go with anything in my wardrobe. These slides are really nice and I highly recommend them.

"Update: I would give these negative stars if I could. I ordered a replacement and they sent me the same ones. The most frustrating thing is that I have adidas shoes with Cloudfoam in them and they’re so comfortable, so why can’t they get these right?

These are falsely advertised. I bought these because a friend of mine has the adidas slides with the Cloudfoam footbed and they are super comfortable. These are NOT Cloudfoam, even though it clearly says they are in the description. These are hard rubber and are very uncomfortable. You’re better off with cheap flip flops from a convenience store.",1,0,17
"I needed a pair of sandals to wear in my house for the summer time.

I learned my lesson over the winter buying the cheapest pair of slippers on amazon, they lasted about 2 weeks.... So with this purchase I decided to spend a few more bucks and buy a decent brand.

Adidas has always made good footwear, and I was surprised that they had a pair of sandals at my price point. Having owned a few pairs of Adidas shoes in my day, I knew they would be good quality.

The product came as described and shipped in time.

Again, these sandals are only being used indoors. With that said, they are perfect. Very durable and comfortable. They have good arch support which does help with my bad lower back, whereas other sandals are completely flat.

The sandals stay on my feet no matter what I am doing, and I am confident that they will last me a couple years to come they are so well made.

I highly recommend these sandals if you are looking for something affordable and durable.

Thank you,

"These shoes are very comfortable on the feet. When I first tried them on they felt super nice and I was excited to wear them around the house. They are, however very small.

I wear a women's size 11, which I ordered, but I couldn't fit my foot into them. My feet are wide, so it happens sometimes. No big deal. I ordered the men's instead since they're always wider. My size is a men's 9. But I got a 10 just in case. Too big is better than too small. Except nope. Still too small. I could fit my foot in, but it was almost painfully snug and the back lined up exactly with my heel.

Because of non Amazon related delivery issues it was such a bother to just get the darn shoes that I decided it wasn't worth returning again. I'd just keep wearing them and see if they stretch out. Fortunately they did. They also mold to fit your foot after a little while. So they're very comfy.

But only if you wear them for a little while. Bumping around my house is no issue, but I live in a large apartment complex in the way back. Nowhere near the mailbox. I've worn them to check the mail a few times and by the time I get back, my feet and calves hurt. This has never been an issue before, and I wear flat sandals or flip flops for everything.

Additionally, these shoes squeak. On my way back from the mailbox I always annoy myself with the sound of the shoes squeaking. And that's just from a little bit of foot sweat. I can't imagine how awful they'd sound if I actually wore them in the shower as intended.

Overall, I don't hate them because they are comfy to wear around the house. But when they specified shower shoes, they weren't freaking kidding! These are NOT meant for wearing out!",3,0,17
"I ordered this product for my husband size 11. I remember clicking on the right size. When it arrived it was size 8. I thought ok maybe i messed up, let me reorder size 11. I clicked on size 11 go to check out, and of course i pay attention this time. It shows size 8, so pay attention it defoults to size 8. They are nice shoes, i will keep them for myself they fit perfectly womens size 9. My husband realy wanted them, he is going to be upset when he gets home and finds out what happened. Was really looking forward to getting them.",1,0,17
"These are ok to keep in your gym locker for shower after workouts/ Better to buy the originals, made with actual rubber, for gym, shower, indoor and outdoor use. The extra few dollars will be worth it. I've always used the originals but thought this time I'd try the Comforts. Actually they're not very comfortable, feel cheap so I gave these only three stars. The sole material is poly-something. I realize the material used is necessary to reduce the cost. The originals are made with actual rubber material for better wear, versatility, and are a much more comfortable fit and feel.",3,0,17
"I bought a pair of these at a brick-and-mortar store and LOVED them so much I wanted a 2nd pair. Shortly after, I ordered these from Amazon but the product is much different (and inferior). First of all the size 10 I got I can't fit my foot into and I have average width feet (not wide). Second, the sole material is a harder, shinny plastic rather than the soft-to-the-touch material that made the 1st pair so comfortable. The only conclusion I can make is that these are fake.",1,0,17
"I like these sandals. I will say they have an arch them to match the arch on your feet, which takes some getting used to, but now I feel it adds some support to your feet. I will say, if you prefer a looser feel, you may not want to purchase these as the straps are low so that your feet are secured, but for some people it might be feel constricting and uncomfortable. If you have wide feet, I would also recommend getting a half or full size up because the strap will feel even more constricting on your feet.",5,1,17
"My 13 year old son has flat feet and his podiatrist wants him in shoes of some sort all waking hours. Being 13, orthotics aren’t cool. I got him these for his “inside shoes” because they looked to have some build in support. A rarity in slides. He said they feel really good on his feet, even better than his sneakers with inserts. I ended up buying two more pairs. One for outside and one for his soccer bag. His grandpa even ended up ordering a pair for around the house because they’re so comfortable!",5,1,17
"Great for the shower which is exactly why I bought them. Check the pictures, I wear size 10 and it fits greats",5,1,17
"I used to wear these flops when I was in high school/college and played soccer. Always loved them and then...they just disappeared from my life. I needed something for kicking around inside/outside at home and got these because they are so cheap. Though I'd try them again. So great. So comfortable. Just perfect. I wish I'd kept buying them for the last almost 30 years since high school.

Wait. I've been out of high school for almost 30 years? Hang on, I need to go cry. Like times aren't hard enough right now, I need this too? At least I've got comfortable flops to wear.",5,1,17
"Adidas offers two main types of slides. Shower slides (this model) and also comfort slides so I will do a quick comparison.

Comfort slides are softer and much more comfortable, both in the footbed and upper strap. But being that the strap has a lot of cushion, if they get wet they will take some time to dry up. Also, there’s a gap between the strap and the footbed by design, so if you take them to the beach a lot of sand will get stuck.

On the other hand the shower slides (this model) are a little lighter but they have a harder footbed and a less cushiony upper strap so if they get wet they will dry much quicker. However the shower slides run a little small compared to the comfort slides so I would suggest ordering a bigger size. (See the picture I attached. Shower slides on the top with the tag and comfort slides on the bottom)

So just to summarize.

Comfort slides
- Better for day to day activities without getting wet or waking on the sand
- More comfortable

Shower slides (this model)
- Better for the pool, beach, shower or anything that involves water and sand.
- More practical",4,1,17
"We do not believe these are actually ADIDAS. They are hard plastic with no bend. There is no padding at all. It's as if they attended to shape it like a foot, but it does not fit a real foot. It does not look well put together, like they are already about to break.

These cost us $25, which was a bit of a splurge for sliders, because it's a Christmas gift for my son. But my husband's $12 sliders are much more comfortable. We compared them to my daughter's ADIDAS sliders, and they are so far off, it's just not possible these are real. They are so uncomfortable, we wouldn't want to keep them even if they were $5. But 25?",1,0,17
"I absolutely hate walking barefoot inside my home. Even though my floors are clean, I needed new house shoes because we don't wear outside shoes in the house! That's disgusting and who wants to bring in s*** from the outside into your home? (let that sink in). So I've always wanted to get some Adidas slides and this quarantine situation just makes me spend more money then I want to because shopping just keeps me entertained. So I decided to get some and I'm glad I did! I love the quality of these adidas slides, although I felt I should've ordered a half size bigger just for extra wiggle room- this'll do! For anyone who wants to look stylish at home, get some of these.",5,1,17
I like Adidas but dislike these shoes. I have disgusting roommates so I got these to wear in the shower. They fit width and length wise but have an extreme arch. Admittedly I have very flat feet but never in 40 years have I worn shoes with such an arch that my feet felt like they were being ripped apart. For the purpose of showering for 10mins they are bearable but I had planned on using them around the lake too which I definitely can't do due to major pain caused by the arch. For that reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because they do work in the shower for short periods. Its as fair as I can be for as uncomfortable as they are.,2,0,17
"These thin out in the toe area making them uncomfortable to walk in. You end up adding a lot more weight on your toes since they are sloped that way and are a lot less comfortable than my nike slides. The contouring also is a bit too steep so it feels awkward as soon as you put them on, especially since the material isn't that soft. I'd recommend getting a different pair that doesn't thin out in the toe area.",2,0,17
"I should’ve read more reviews before purchasing. Got these for my husband who’s an 8.5 and complained about his nike sandals feeling small (size 8) so I thought this size would be just right for him but no! They fit like an 8 or 8.5 in women’s size. I even thought for a second I had mistakenly ordered a women’s size 9. I’m a 7.5 and they even work for me, I might keep them to wear with socks but it was a bummer they didn’t fit my husband.",4,1,17
I have another pair in pink and love them but this pair is so scratchy on the top of my right foot and it hurts! It’s definitely the thread used at the very edge on the underside of the shoe closest to the ankle. I thought they needed to be broken in but that’s definitely not the case. I had to put a bandaid on the underside so help with the issue but that doesn’t look good at all. Not sure why the other pair had no issues but these do.,2,0,17
"The entire thing is made from this soft foam which makes it really comfy. The problem? The adidas logo cut into the heel portion of the foot, because of how it's cut, that part feels like it digs into your foot. It's noticeable right off the bat, even through socks, and quite irritating after a few minutes of walking. That being the case, this might all be a matter of the break-in period, which might go away after some time, but right out of the box is this slight digging problem that's small but noticeable problem. Will update after some time with them.

Edit: Break-in period over, problem still persists. After a full day, I found a backwards imprint of the addias logo on my foot, making me feel like I've been branded by the company. Not a daily sandal",3,0,17
"Worst quality ever. I took a shower and worn them, in less than a day the sides started coming off. One day later it’s completely off only attached with a very thin layer of rubber. Photos show the second day. I would not recommend. Either it’s fake or just super low quality. Get the Aqua version not this shower one for better quality and comfort",1,0,17
I wear an 8 and order a 10. Seems great so far. Got them on now. Spongie. Comfortable and heating up to foot. Cuff is good on this one. Some the cuff is too tight and hurts your foot. Foot bed fits foot good. A little expensive at ~$25. Most I have paid for a flip flop. I have bought more expensive but returned them because of fit. Rating was very good. Stripes look great. A little flashy but match my shorts. For showers I guess which is great. Just hope they do not stink after a while.,4,1,17
"I've had better sandals from a dollar store. I wonder if they are even authentic Adidas product as they are so cheaply fashioned and not anywhere close to a size 10 men's. (The strap going across is so tight, and I still cannot get my toes all the way under it - these are clearly women's sizes or children). I don't normally review products but I had to warn others. I searched by highest rated product when buying and man they are doing something fishy to have such good reviews. Even the sizing issue aside, the actual material is like plastic and feels like they just took some hardened packing foam and put a strap across it (and were so cheap they used an inch less of the strap to save even more money). I figuratively shot myself in the foot buying these instead of my normal brand because they went up in price. I adidas this to myself - don't adidas this to you - do not buy!",2,0,17
"I wouldn't try walking 10+ miles or anything in these but for lounging around the house, walking the dog or getting the mail, they are perfect. I love the 3-stripe branding as I've always been an Adidas fan and these look really good. They hold up while wet and I find they dry quickly unlike some of my flip flops that I have. They are versatile as I can wear them barefoot or with socks and still be comfortable.",5,1,17
Looks great but was a bit too small for me. Bought a sized 9 as I am normally a 9 but should have bought one sized bigger. Gave to my father-in-law and he loves them.,5,1,17
"These slip on sliders are the best and most comfortable sandals/thongs/sliders I've ever bought. My pair is durable and so comfortable. It might seem strange but I look forward to wearing these as I'm slipping my feet into them. They are that comfortable. I'm sure they will show signs of eventual wear and tear. When that day comes, I'm buying another pair. Love em!",5,1,17
These slippers are not the most comfortable things you can buy. The material used to make them is kind of hard and you can feel the pressure from the surface you’re walking on transmitted through the slipper to the bottom of your feet. The support from the sole is almost missing. The fit of these slippers is also quite tight (small) and I would recommend that people with wider feet should go for a size larger than they usually wear.,2,0,17
"After a few botched orders of other brand’s house-type shoes, I finally found JUST what I was looking for with these bad boys! I found that w/ in this price point (as well as being a mens, size 15), the selections w/in ~$20 price-point were a bit misleading — and was pleasantly surprised to find these Adidas sandals even listed in this range! I figure I’d write-up this review in the hopes of saving you some time/disappointment.

In general, there’s ~3 main styles of house-type shoe options that caught my eye: moccasins (slip-on/regular), beach
“thong” sandals, & the “shower” model (fixed strap/velcro over the foot in closed-cell resin, think these/Crocs). Being size 15, the moccasins I found had sketchy treads and where WAY too clunky/huge making them a challenge in the middle of the night, or any damp/wet floor situations like showering/bathing. The beach sandal I found had SUPER scratchy material between the toes, which at this point in this “house-shoe misadventure” I made lemonade from these 2 lemons making the later an automatic supplemental Nurf football back-up, LOL…

Alrighty, so in closing, here’s my PROS & CONS of these Adidas —

PROS:
+ they arrive a touch snug allowing you to break them in perfectly
+ surprisingly deep/receptive foot/arch support
+ slick, simple design style w/ nice contrasted colors
+ very easy to clean up ENTIRE sandal
+ quality name brand at an amazing price-point
+ comes in big/tall sizes
+ applicable to an array of situations/uses

CONS:
- spotty availability
- same versions scattered/unconsolidated via vendor/model

Good luck, happy purchasing all!",5,1,17
"I purchased this exact style over a year-and-a-half ago from Amazon and they were very good quality: the edges were finished and secure and upper and footbed nicely molded. They were super comfy and have held up pretty well, but after 1.5 years they've loosened up a bit. I thought I would buy a second pair, since I knew the style and my size it would be a no-brainer.

When I first took these out of the package I was certain that I had gotten fakes from a third-party seller. But I checked, and the seller was Amazon.com. The quality is horrendous. The foam edges don't seem like they were finished at all and the entire upper is bent all over the place at odd angles.

I don't know what to make of this. Since I don't think it's likely Amazon as a seller would be selling fakes , the only thing I can conclude is either Amazon is selling defective merchandise, or Adidas quality control has gotten way downhill.",1,0,17
I initially purchased a size 10 which is my normal size but when they arrived and I tried them on I couldn't wear them all the way because of the super narrow shape. So I returned that pair and ordered a size up. When the size 11 pair came in and I tried them on I was able to fit my feet in them but it was still very restricting. I tried walking in them and it's very uncomfortable. It's a shame too since I love the look of them. These particular sandals are only meant to be worn by narrow feet :(,1,0,17
"I liked the price. I liked the stripes. That’s all.

Went to daughter’s swim meet today with my new “comfy” kicks. Pffft. My a$$! These Men’s size 10 Adidas Sliders are GARBAGE. The top of my right foot now has a cut on it from some sharp portion in the shoe. The right one didn’t stay on for some reason as well. The left one’s arch is like the stinking St. Louis bridge! I don’t know what human foot it is made for. Perhaps a chimpanzee. I’ve seen their arches. Pretty wild. My pinky toe on my left foot has a blister as well. Run a bit small too.

I just don’t have anything super nice to say about them. Just don’t get them.",1,0,17
"Bought the Adidas shower slides shown on left to replace a 6 yr old pair of Addidas superstar shower slides shown on the right! The Adelete slides are lighter, more comfortable, have a molded foot bed, and are easier to walk in than the Superstar slides i owned for 6 yrs! They also have an all foam footbed verses a microcloth covered cushioned footbed! Wet and dry traction are about equal between the two however the superstar slides had much more tread and look to be more durable! Only owned the Adelette’s a couple weeks now! That is why the 3 star rating for durability! Time will tell how well they hold up! I looked for velcro adjustable slides so i could adjust how secure they fit but to be honest i went with all the other ratings for these slides! 43,000 plus in sales has got to account for something! Glad i did because these are easier to walk with than my old pair even though they fit less secure than my old pair! I even wear socks with the new pair and have no difficulty going barefoot in them ! They walk fine either way! I use both pairs to walk on our hard tile floors, in the shower only to clean them, and to wear walking outside to get the mail. If they hold up like my Superstars they will be a winner in my book!",5,1,17
"I ordered 1 size larger. They were long enough but they are extremely narrow and neither my husband or I can wear them. They are so tight just trying them on they rubbed badly on top of my toes and my out foot just below the pinky toe in bunion region. I don’t have a bunion but it felt like I did after I wore them a couple minutes. Within around 10 minutes I had to take them off because my feet hurt so badly. They do have a very nice arch support, especially from sandals/slip ons. My husband tried wearing them a couple hours in honors he could stretch them out for me. It didn’t work, so he suffered for me. It must be love lol. If you have very narrow feet then these would probably work but not for Normal or slightly wider feet. I would do an adjustable in those instances. Feeling let down because I really like them!!!!!",1,0,17
Order a size up they are not authentic adidas slides. ( I didn’t know hubby told me when they arrived) They tore up within a week of wearing. I bought them for my husband to put on after he is done working so his work boots can stay in his truck. I do not recommend.,1,0,17
"The sandals are super comfortable.

Sizing:
If you’re deciding between two sizes I’d recommend going with the larger size. I typically wear a size 8.5 or 9 in women’s depending on the shoe. I was hoping to avoid ordering a size that was too small and for that reason I decided to order a men’s size 7, which is a women’s 9 according to Google. It fit perfectly.",5,1,17
"I ordered this shoe for my 11 y.o. I started with a size 6, children's. Then, a men's size 7, followed by a men's size 8. They were ALL the SAME SIZE. None of them fit! Thank goodness a major warehouse store got a very similar Adidas shoe in at the time we were trying to find a shoe to fit. I had to return the size 6, 7, & 8 to Amazon. The warehouse store had an Adidas size 8 that were just a smidgen too big, so we kept that pair. Yet the size 8 from Amazon was too small. I have no idea what is going on with the sizing of this Amazon shoe.",1,0,17
"I used to have the same type of Adidas shower sandals several years ago. I ordered a new pair, my shoes are usually 10, but the 10 was rather small. I kept it to give it as a present to a young nephew. I ordered 11 and they fit well. It is of a somewhat lower quality than the same product I used to have, it has the feeling of being made of plastic, may be it is all plastic. The support feels rather different than most sandals, but I do not know if that is a bad thing. I ordered the navy blue/white and it is the color of the picture. This order took only three days to arrive (with Prime). Overall, it is just good, I would say that there should be many sandals more comfortable, of better quality (and probably more expensive) than these ones.",4,1,17
"These run a little shorter than true-to-size. The band across the top of the foot is a little tight as well. If you are right at the cusp of your size, size up.

Lots of arch support. Even toe support so you have something to grip your toes on so it doesn’t easily slide off your feet. Very spongy. Almost too spongy to walk in, but they’re comfortable.",3,0,17
"I bought two pairs of these slides for both my sons, one pair in black and white and the other in red and black. They look good and fit true to size. Kids like wearing these with socks to hang out in or take a walk in. My boys don’t plan on using these as shower shoes or getting them wet, so I hope this will make them last longer. I read lots of negative reviews about the durability of this product but in the end I went with it anyway because I didn’t want to pay so much money for something my boys would use occasionally and casually. I buy flip flops from Old Navy for myself. They’re about $4. They last until they last, then they break and I throw them away and get myself another pair. So same logic applies for me with these slides too. My boys are still growing and especially the younger one will go through a lot of footwear before his foot grows to full size. So if they break within a year, so be it. We’ll replace them or look at another brand.",4,1,17
"I bought two pair of these: one for my husband and one for myself. I felt the pair that I tried on was tight across my foot, while my husband felt that his felt a teeny bit loose. We traded shoes and are very happy with the trade LOL. He feels they have nice arch support, while I feel they are little bit slippery while I walk. I bought sandals from Adidas online before that are more padded and softer, these ones are more plasticky feeling but do the job. I bought two pair of these one for my husband and one for myself. I felt the pair that I tried on was tight across my foot, while my husband felt that his fell a teeny bit loose. We traded shoes and are very happy with the trade LOL. He feels they have nice our support, while I feel they are a little bit slippery while I walk.

We will wear these to the pool and stores.I am a size 11 in women’s and I bought a size 11. My husband is size 10.5 in men’s and also bought size 11.",4,1,17
"These sandals run way small and they are made for narrow feet. My feet aren’t even wide or at least I never buy wide shoes. My foot doesn’t fit comfortably in these sandals because it does not go all the way in because of the design. As far as size goes, I ordered a pair at my normal size and they were too small. I then ordered another pair a size up and they were also too small. I’d recommend buying two sizes up IF you’re going to buy at all. My overall recommendation would be to find other sandals.",1,0,17
"I can’t count the number of shoes I have owned… This is among the worst fitting… Oddest feel I have had—HORRIBLE IMO
It fits and yet feels small all around
Strangest feeling arch… That makes standing and walking feel as if you’ve got some thing under you in the wrong place
Definitely would not recommend and just can’t be bothered returning… How do you not get something like this right? The arch is just too far forward I think IMO did I say uncomfortable? IMO",1,0,17
"These aren't very comfortable. They have a scratchy irritating feel to the fabric part by the toes. Not a good quality for being Adidas. Wouldn't suggest. Thought they would break in, but now it's to late to return.",2,0,17
"INFO/DETAILS: I ordered the scarlet/white/scarlet color in size 6. It was the most affordable color that was available at the time. It’s actually more red than hot pink like the photo shows, which is fine with me either way.

COMFORT: The material is not cushiony, in fact it is a bit rigid. It is still comfortable, and I feel like the molding/shape is nice for support under the toes and the arch.

DURABILITY: I haven’t had these for more than a few days, so I cannot comment on durability yet. I’ll update if anything goes awry, but they seem to be sturdy.

SIZE/FIT: Make sure you measure your foot according to the included size chart for this item listing. I am typically a 6.5 in men’s/boys, but I was a 6 according to the chart. Glad I measured, because the 6 fits nicely. A 6.5 or a 7 would have been too loose.",5,1,17
"These sandals have one of the largest arches I've ever seen. The description is accurate when it says 0-3 inches in terms of platform height. The top of the arch is literally about 3 inches higher than the surrounding sandal. Thanks to this giant arch, the sandal was both slightly too long for my foot and MUCH too narrow to actually insert the foot under the strap.
Honestly, these are the strangest shaped pieces of footwear I've ever encountered and I'd strongly recommend not trying them unless you know you have a strange shaped foot.",1,0,17
"Was using NIKE for a long and so wanted to try a different one. I am happy with the comforts, primarily because of the reasons that are mentioned below in the pros section. Highly recommended.

My 2 cents below:

Pros:
- Good material. Feels good while wearing
- Seems to be durable enough
- True to the size chart
- Very good build quality
- Sole is soft and can be worn for a long without any pain
- Can be used both indoors and outdoors

Cons:
- I did get some strain from the sides that I should get used to it. So it depends on your foot to get adjusted to it as it is not very soft as such but I think it is the same with all slippers",4,1,17
I have a few of the Cloudfoam shoes from Adidas and they are all super comfortable and amazing to wear for all day use....these not so much. They seem just as hard as a cheap plastic sandal.,3,0,17
I golf a lot in the summer and I don't wear socks. I don't ever wear socks I hate them and my feat get too hot. These are a pleasure. If they get wet they'll be dry in minutes...they clean easily. They're always there for me easy to slip on and surprisingly they don't fall off my feet like many flip flops do. One thing to note: I typically wear a men's SIZE 14 shoe across the board. That option was not available with these so the ones here in the picture are a SIZE 13. They're fine...flip flops are different. You don't have to match your normal shoe size EXACTLY. I'M ELATED with my purchase of these. Alex,5,1,17
"Don't waste your money, these are cheaply made and don't hold up. I've never had this experience with adidas slides before so I am deeply disappointed they started coming apart within a few months after they arrived. I bought them at the end of April and the strap started pulling away from the sides a few weeks ago. I usually only wear them around the house and occasionally outside when I'm running a quick errand. Other than falling apart, I will say the shoe fit is true to size and they were fairly comfortable and somewhat supportive, but what difference does that make if they only last 2 or 3 months. So sad 😞",1,0,17
"Shower slides only. If you are only taking a 10-15 minute shower, they'll be great. For anything else please read. The stitching on the inside of the slide that rubs on the top of you foot and starts to hurt after 15-20 minutes. Just the 2 hours I wore them 2 other other people said they had the same problem. I misread the description. So 5 stars for what they are meant for. I went with the Adidas comfort & they are perfect.
For a shower or with socks = ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️
For a water park or day at the lake 1 star = ⭐️",5,1,17
"It took me testing 3 different types of sandals or shower slides in various sizes before I finally decided on these. These are fantastic, and hug your feet perfectly. I kept having an issue with my heel sliding all over the place during walking, while trying out other brands. This ended up with my feet kicking up dirt or brushing against things and getting filthy! After lots of hassle and returns, I tried these out. These have a slight indent/dip in the heel that nestles your heel and keeps it from sliding around. There is also a little dip for your toes on the front for the same effect. Seriously, BUY THEM NOW if you're debating.",5,1,17
"The product arrived without any physical damage or cosmetic imperfections,

The design is good and material seems durable enough for normal wear and showers. The sturdy shoe hanger is a nice bonus.

At first, I was on the verge of returning them, because of their high midsole. Every twenty to thirty minutes of standing/walking caused severe pain in the midfoot area. As my feet are slightly flat, I thought that I'm probably not used to this kind of slippers. After three days of using them, the pain dispersed.

It's already a month that I'm using them and i think that their high midsole kinda fixed my slight flat feet.",4,1,17
"I was a little hesitant about purchasing these because my husband actually wears an 8.5 shoe. So I didn’t know if I should go up or down half a size.
I’m glad I went down half the size to the 8. He’s able to wear them alone or with socks. (I know... ewww... but no worries, I don’t let him leave the house with socks and sandals). However, the fact that he can wear them comfortably around the house with his socks when his feet are cold and they stay on without sliding around or without socks on a hot day for him is a huge plus!!!!

Hubs is an Adidas snob, if something has an athletic logo, it has to be Adidas. As far as we can tell, these are the real deal. They came in the Adidas box with the Adidas packaging.",5,1,17
Worn these slides 6 times in the month and a half. Walking to my mail box and the top of the slide became unglued and is unwearable. I’ve worn these slides from adidas for 20 + years and they usually last 1-3 years depending on how much I wear them. Been on hold with Amazon for 45 minutes and they are seeing what they can do to process a return or send me a replacement. The customer service representative gave me 3 options. 1) 20% restocking fee 2) contact seller and ask them to process a replacement or credit. 3) return item for a replacement and pay shipping. I think this is unrealistic due to the fact that these slides are only a month and half old and the product is a defect. Not sure if these slides are 100% authentic adidas. Never had any adidas slides come unglued after using them 6 times and are less then 2 months old.,1,0,17
"It's great to have grips on the bottom of the shower shoes, but you also need some sort of gripping friction between your foot and the insole of the shoe. I don't know why I need these, I could do just as well coating my feet with vegetable oil. They get very slippery on the inside and not on the outside when wet, and when you plant your foot to take a step the sliding of great concern.

Not sure what I'll use them for now. Spider smackers, maybe? Terrible engineering, Adidas. Steer clear of these things.",1,0,17
I got to admit they're very comfortable they offer a really good support but they don't last that long these things are ripped after about a month-and-a-half and I only use them in the night time when I'm jumping in the shower and coming out not to mention they're very slippery from the bottles I would not recommend them you know stepping out of the shower with them unless you have something on the bottom they look really nice so I wouldn't that but for your safety I would be careful in this purchase because they might rip like-minded or you might slip on them,3,0,17
I take a 10.5 shoe & that’s what I got in this & it didn’t fit it was tight on my feet! So I got a bigger size I believe it was either 12 or 13 & still was tight on my feet! Not sure if it is supposed to be like that but it was uncomfortable & had to take it back for the second time. So I’m going with the adjustable strap one when it comes in stock.,1,0,17
"I really like these slides. They offer phenomenal support to my feet. They are very comfy, durable and fit as expected according to the sizing chart. They are excellent value for the money paid. I highly recommend this product.

Lovely authentic Adidas sandals. Cloud foam fluffy feel. Comfy and beautiful on my feet too. As a lady I just sized down two sizes in men size and voila. Love my scarlet sandals.,5,1,17
"Needed new flip flops and these are very comfortable considering they are snug for my size (size 9s).
That is my usual size - but these do fit snug .. no way I could wear socks with these.

Rather than deal with returns I'm just wearing them as normal as.. they are flip flops and I aint old enough to need to wear socks with my flipflops :)

Over all very nice pair .. it is now my primary footware considering working from home and all :)

Heck... I just might wear these into the office when I go back!!!

HAH!",5,1,17
"I have an older version of this product that I've had for years but they are wearing out and I wanted to replace them. I received the new slip ons and noticed they seemed to be made of much lower quality materials than the older version I have. I decided to give them a chance anyway but after a few days, I had pain in my knees and ankles due to lack of the support. The soles of these slippers are very, very soft and cheap feeling with no support whatsoever.

Either Adidas quality has dropped significantly or the slippers I received are counterfeit. Either way, I am returning them.",1,0,17
"The standard Adidas slides are brilliant for pool side, public gym shower, running around the house, or quick trips to the store. I wear them around the house and when I have to go outside and don’t want to put on sneakers.

You can’t go wrong with them and that’s why I have 3 pair to work with my other Adidas track suits.",5,1,17
"I have to admit, I love 'em and hate 'em. While being very comfortable, they are unforgiving at the toe box. I'm hoping they'll ""break in"". The forward edge of the strap cuts into the top of my middle toe; it seems more pronounced on one sandal than the other. I have to wear a band-aid or piece of tape on top of my toe to protect it from the ""bite"".
Wish I could give them 5-stars, but due to this issue with the sharp edge nicking my toe(s) I have to de-rate them a bit. If I'm able to toughen up my toe's epidermis then I'll use them 24x7!",4,1,17
I generally fit into size 11 and the description noted something about the size being actual. I also have wide feet so I tend to try and fine wide versions that are almost impossible to actually find. I ordered size 11's and they fit ok but are a bit snug and after walking a little they get all funky/angled as my foot is too big for them do to having wide feet. I almost got the next size up but was afraid of having flippers...lol. I love the molded to the foot design just a little bummed on the size. My knock on the star is because of no wide option or wider moulded design to account of it if no wide is even available.,4,1,17
"When I was young I wore slippers...always. Or cheap flip flops... This is my first slide style shoe. Initially very nice. As I got older I wore Crocs, Rainbow flips, Tevas. Tevas are my go to for walks. Very tough. These slides are cool and comfy, easy to put on, good cushy sole (Better than Crocs), and lightweight (lighter than Tevas). Just a few hours into wearing these, and I am enjoying them. The only concern is the top strap, possibly a bit weak since it is a single stitch. For the price it is a great option, to help with foot pain or possibly minor back ache... A definite must try, in the age where there are so many orthopedic options. ( BTW...I love that they are waterproof!!!)
Thanks.

"I had a steel blue pair of these for years. I don't know what happened to them.
I think hey finally broke, don't remember. I had them for years and years.
I moved to cheapo flips form $ stores etc., that last a year.
Then came acrossed these on sale while browsing and thought ""you need them again"".
Package arrived very swiftly.
Slides fit like a glove. I'm a narrow 12.
They fit great.
That's the beauty of these, they kinda mold to your feet like hard clay.
I feel like I cheated myself by not re-buying them years ago.
They are my favorite all around foot covering.
I wear them everywhere.
Red and white is very sharp looking.",5,1,17
"I have another pair of what I thought were the exact same slides from Adidas, both with CloudFoam. My last pair are getting worn out from three years of indoor/outdoor use and happen to be incredibly soft from day one. I was extremely disappointed when I tried the new sandals on because it was like stepping on golf balls with pressure points in spots of my feet that didn't make sense. The shoes are small, and very contoured, unlike prior versions. They are also very plastic-y feeling, which might have something to do with ""shower"" slides, but they do say CloudFoam, so what's the deal?",2,0,17
"The quality and make of the sandals was overall great. They seem very comfortable and would have loved to kept them since I have always gotten a long life out of this brand of sandals. However, this time around I decided to go with a different model/color and they were really tight around the actual foot. That is the reason I'm only giving it 3 bc it was too tight around the foot. Otherwise it would be a good set of sandals to use. Ended up just gifting this pair to a someone with smaller feet. So if you usually buy sandals at say size 10, but you want this pair get them in 10.5 or 11 to be safe.",3,0,17
"Six up two sizes!! We sized up one size since
A lot of others said to size up and not true to size... well you can say that again.. not true to size and we sized up and it was still small and ankle was hanging of the back.. there a big bump where your foot lays under the band and maybe that’s the problem.. it’s for support but it’s high bump and uncomfortable.. takes away space and your toes don’t go all the way to the front.. you have to ouch your foot all the way to the front and like hold on with your toes for it to barely hang of the back. Nice color and all but the sizing is what bothers my husband.",4,1,17
"Purchased to replace a different style of adidas slides. The previous style was fantastic but unfortunately I couldn’t find it in my size, so I took a chance on these. Big mistake.

Pros:
* the grey & white is a nice clean look
* straps seems well made

Cons:
* the size 8 is tiny (I should have went a size up)
* the sole is hard
* almost no arch support
* ridges for toes are poorly place

I would send these back had I not wore them outside on a walk. They honestly free so bad, I’m starting to think they’re knockoffs. Back to looking for replacement slides.",2,0,17
"I look like a fool with these on in public. They are easily a size too big. I normally wear a 10 in Nike running shoes. Size aside, I had to take the thread out of the top edge because it was digging into the top of my foot, easy to do, but they were unbearable otherwise. My son's pair of the exact same slides didn't have this. I plan to wear these out and then get the next size down. They are very comfortable and I used to wear all the time in highschool/college before and after soccer...didn't know they still made them. Even more comfortable...but the old uppers were better IMO.",3,0,17
"Good contour on the slide to match your foot. Very comfy because of this.

Functional durability is likely good, but I generally only wear them for a short amount of time each day so I can't speak to that.

Cosmetic durability is lacking. The white stripes have already cracked after a month or two. Not super visble standing off from the wearer.

They stay on your foot as well as you'd expect any slide to.

I'm having trouble uploading pictures with slow internet. I will update this review with more pictures later.",4,1,17
"I bought this Adidas Cloudfoam sandals as a comfortable substitute to my old Adidas sliders, but this turned out to be anything but comfortable. The upper part of the sandal is narrow and it squeezes my foot; the inner material is somewhat coarse and creates friction with the toes and sides of the feet. The sandals are not comfortable, although nicely designed and built. Total disappointment, and I am a big fan of Adidas sliders -- had them for 20 odd years in different styles...",1,0,17
"Theres nothing that says quality, and respect more so than A D I D A S. When you see the TRIPLE STRIPES, that lets you know, you are about to be in the presence, or better yet, you are about to be Sporting a piece of footwear that will stand up to anything a wearer will walk into, and these Slip Ons are awesome on the beach, the shower, the house, or anywhere you need to get something on your feet in the quick of time and look FRESH while doing it.",5,1,17
"These were super stiff right out of the box and very short and snug compared to the regular (non-shower) cloud foam slides I have.

Within a few days of wear though, the soles do break in and become softer and more flexible.

The tops of the slides aren’t totally waterproof as they will hold on to a decent amount of water if you actually do wear them in a shower. But they are much faster drying than the non-shower cloud foam slides.

Overall, great purchase and much more supportive and comfortable than any flip flop(including crocs and vionics).",5,1,17
"Poor craftsmanship. Somehow I would like a refund for my purchase of these Adidas sandals slides.
The top foot strap of these sandals has come undone from the outside edge. (See photo).

It was mistake to purchase these poorly manufactured Adidas sandals slides.",1,0,17

So, I was really excited when I saw these with the smooth insole area, and I've worn them often since I got them. So, comfy! Well worth the money. The only problem I had as a female was in sizing correctly, I wear a 8 1/2-9 in female shoes, I ordered a 6 in these slides but should've went one size up, 7 perhaps. I recommend if you're a female buying these that you use a measuring tape as suggested by Addias.",5,1,17
"These were nice but ran small. My son wears a 5.5Y in sneakers with extra room at the toe and I got a 6 in these and he couldn’t even get his foot in them. He does have a wide foot, but even the length of the shoe was short. You should definitely order up if your foot is wide because you can’t adjust that part. They feel heavy and durable like they will last. Seem comfortable and easy to slip on quickly. The would probably make your feet sweat and potentially smelly if you wear them without socks all the time. Stylish and trendy enough to wear everyday and definitely not just shower shoes.",4,1,17
"Because of the sandals' format, wearing them requires exact knowledge of wearer's foot size. Mine are a bit tight, but a bigger size would have been too loose. Thus, I consider these a perfect fit for me. Using them during the morning shower ""trip."" Durability (I gave 5 stars) is too difficult to predict, but they seem to be of a good quality, and the brand name is famous. Thus, I trust that they will last a long time, because of little daily use.",5,1,17
"I ordered four pairs of this slippers, non of them fit correctly. They are small and tight on our feet. I am very disappointed, my son has this slippers for really long time and they are so comfortable, I thought that I was buying same product just different size.",3,0,17
"I bought these to replace older ones that 8 had worn out that I got at Burlington coat factory. These are well made and actually a better version than the original ones I bought. The issue is, the strap that goes over the foot is much smaller than my original pair causing them to not be able to fit over my foot completely and so they sit crooked under my foot. I'm going to give them time to get broken in, but just buyer beware, these don't fit as well as older versions.",4,1,17
"Bought these red Adidas slides to wear in the house since we don’t wear shoes indoors here. These were highly rated so I got them to replace my Jordan slides. First, they look great with vibrant color and have the classic three stripes. Unfortunately that’s the end of the positives. I have an average width foot and these are crazy narrow. With and without socks on I have to JAM my foot in to get them on. I didn’t take pictures without the socks on to spare everyone the sight. The bottoms scuff SUPER easily so after trying them on they are ineligible to return. The pics of the outsoles are after JUST trying them on a wood floor.",2,0,17
"I got these for my dad. He has problems with his feet. He is also always on the go--and enjoys being outside even when he is home. I thought these would be easy for him to slide on and off; I wanted them because of comfort, too.
When they arrived I could tell that they were exactly what I wanted. My dad tried them on and he likes them. They have thick soles which will be great for his feet.
I'd purchase these again.",4,1,17
"I got these because I wanted flip flops I could wear with sandals. I'm glad I ordered the size that's usually a bit larger than my normal size, because these turned out to be smaller than expected. These aren't comfortable. I guess they're fine for putting on without needing my hands when I need to put something on to take out my building's trash at night once a week, but otherwise I don't think I'll wear these much, because they aren't comfortable.",3,0,17
They are a smidge too small. These shower slides are one piece plastic similar to crocs. I was confused as to which type of slides these were since they look the same and are both listed as adilette style. I like that these have the adidas written on the side. The picture shows 2 different adidas slides; the shower slides (right) and the cloudfoam slides(left). The ones on the right are these shower slides....which I will return because they run small. The one on the left is the softer cloudfoam slide which I love.,3,0,17
Read reviews and sized down as most said. Was a mistake in my case had to return and go next size up. Will redo review when I receive next size up. *update* received new pair next size up to 10 and they fit great. They felt a bit snug at first but after wearing for a week they adjusted perfectly to my feet! I really love these slides and are very comfortable. Check your size. I normally wear a 9.5 but 10 fit me great and not too big.,5,1,17
"I bought these to replace some really comfortable Adidas slides I got from Costco, which they no longer sell. I could not believe how hard these were. It was like walking in plastic (like hard plastic). I immediately knew this was a mistake and regretted getting them. This is one of the problems with buying clothes/shoes online... you cannot feel the item to see what you are getting.

If you need some outdoor slides to slap the crap out of some attacking wildlife, these will do. If you wanted even an ounce of comfort, move on to something else.",1,0,17
Got these for my daughter and she loves them. I decided to try them on myself and lol I can not wear them. Unfortunately I have bunions and over time my toes have slowly been pushed in the wrong direction. These sandals have a molded foot bottom. So if you have any malformation in your feet. This probably won’t be a good choice. I was really bummed because I love the way they look. Hope this helps someone out there 😊,5,1,17
"I really wanted to like these sandals but the material that they’re made of is a bit stiff and my feet sweat so my feet slip while walking. Next, the size, I’m getting sick and tired of having to pay good money for products made in China where they don’t know how to make a good product cause they don’t have quality control. Everything they make is geared towards the Asian market. They have smaller bodies and feet compared to Americans. When you shop for shoes, your choices are medium or wide, no more C, D, E, EE, etc.. So now you have to go to a store and hope for the best.",4,1,17
I’ve had them for a few months now and my only complaint is that the top part rubbed my foot and gave me a red line after I took them off. I kept using them and now I think my foot toughened up enough they don’t leave the line,5,1,17
"Comfortable; hugs the turf; dries quickly except for the part that goes over the foot. Several that looked good had reviews that they filled with water and stayed soggy. This product does what you want. I haven't tried it for walking outside. I'm sure it would be comfortable but I don't know about support or longevity. I read many reviews of this and similar shoes that people wore as outside sandals, which surprised me.",5,1,17
"I purchased a ""Male size 11"" for my husband, but these were so incredibly small he couldn't even get his full foot on them. They did fit my feet though, which is a Female size 7.5/8. Although I did not send them back or write the review right away when I purchased them, I am still quite disappointed in this purchase, as we did not receive what the right product. I did keep them because they did fit me, however, they are pretty uncomfortable and only wear them when I need to run outside real quick and then back into the house. Definitely would not recommend purchasing these off Amazon, I would suggest going into the actual store and trying on sizes.",1,0,17
"I really like these slides because of the foot mold. This time around, I felt like the strap was a lot tighter and felt very plastic. Perhaps it is the grey color, or just that you should probably get half a size up from your usual to get it to fit. I am a 12 and I ordered a 12 but it felt like a 10.5 when I was walking around. My older dark blue pair fit pretty well and I still use it.",4,1,17
I am a big boy... 6’2 340 lbs and wear a size 14 shoe. Slides never fit fight and always try to twist sideways on my feet. My son bought these for himself and one day I squeezed into them to get groceries out of the car and even tho they were size 11 I liked them. I ordered mine in size 14 and they fit great and stay on my feet like they are supposed to so now I wear these ll of the time! Will def be buying again...,5,1,17
"My husband typically wears 9 or 9.5, and I bought a size 10 in these for him. His heel hits the very back of the shoe, so they only just barely fit. But we weren’t sure if going up another size would be too big. I would recommend sizing up a full size, at least! Overall, very comfortable and will be form fitted (I have a ladies pair of the same ones, and the sizing seems to be better in those",5,1,17
"I ordered a size bigger because of the reviews, and I definitely recommend doing that. There's about a half inch space from foot to end of slipper in front and back, which is how I would want. They're a little snug around the band against the foot, but it will probably loosen a bit in time and be perfect. Overall nice, just needs some breaking in.",4,1,17
"I've been wearing these around the house for a couple of months now. I'm a big guy and I need a little support and these have provided that, kept me comfortable and have held up well. I've had a few Nike slides before and I do love them but decided to check these out as they were cheaper and now I'm not sure I'll spend the extra down the road.",5,1,17
"I bought these for my son. My son wears a men’s size 9 and I did listen to the reviews and went up 2 sizes to an 11. They don’t fit him. I wear a women’s size 9, which I believe is a men’s size 8. And I can barely cramp my foot through the opening. So please don’t waste your money, and they say cloudfoam but they are not!! Please don’t waste you money!!",1,0,17
"These are great. Unlike sandals that have a flat footbed, the footbed on these conform to your feet making comfortable and almost effortless to walk on, you don’t get that urge to lift up your toes to prevent them from flying off as you walk like other sandals. The fact that they also look great is just an added bonus.",5,1,17
"This is my first time ever purchasing Adidas slides from Amazon instead of from Adidas themselves. Honestly I’m so happy that I did, Same great quality, support, comfort, & durability as if I did by from an Adidas store. Amazon offered them at a much lower & reasonable price. As always shipping was amazing & quick too. I plan to purchase as many name brand things I can through Amazon now! Happy customer",5,1,17
"I have been wearing Adidas sliders for years, ever since my kids started playing soccer. I have one pair I love. I'm getting ready for back surgery so I thought I'd get another pair as it would be easy to put them on without bending over. The new sliders are terrible. They weigh about 2 oz. They provide no support that I notice. If I wear them more than 5 minutes the top of my right foot. I had torn the plantar fascia and I know it needs support. The original sliders feel fine, the new ones are definitely an inferior version.",1,0,17
"about 2 sizes too small. are these rejects from adidas or something? it has bulges on the bottom near the heal where the foam was cut… but it isn’t cut flush- reminds me of what a rejected product would be. disappointed, but? usually am buying footwear or clothing online as opposed to in person. would not purchase again, not even a correct size.",1,0,17
The slides seemed great and had support where needed but the straps being non adjustable really limits the fitment. I wear a size 12 a d my right foot is slightly larger than my left but not by much. This was enough though that my right foot would not go into the straps. The left was still tight too. And as anyone who where’s slides a lot knows they wear and stretch over time which is another reason adjustable straps should be standard. I had to return the item as they just did not work for my feet.,2,0,17
"Love the new style. These Adidas slides have a more comfortable foot bed. More cushioning. They look great and fit perfectly. You should order your normal size. But if you want to wear them in the wintertime, you might want to size up. I wear mine with socks in the wintertime. It makes them a bit snug, but still comfortable. To each his own. I will say, I probably have at least 8 pair of Adidas slides.",5,1,17
"I used to wear flip flop in my home with wooden floors but because of winter and cold I had socks on, so as you can imagine flip flop doesn't work that is why I purchased this one. comparing these two, Adidas isn't as comfy also, I usually buy a size 10.5-11 shoes from both Adidas and Nike but the size 11 was small and really narrow for me so I had to exchange it with size 12.",3,0,17
"These sandals are just way way too tight on me. I didn’t know my feet were so wide until I’ve tried buying four pairs of sandals online now and none of them will fit. It’s just something I cant buy online. If you have even somewhat wide feet, just go buy them in person and save yourself all the trouble.

That being said, these are such nice sandals. They would be so comfy and great if my feet weren’t too wide. Such a steal for the price, very well made. So sad I can’t fit them because I’d never take them off. Hope this review helps.",4,1,17
"Every shoe I wear is a size 11 (US). Just regular, nothing out of the ordinary. And bought these, size 11. I would say the material is normal. Nothing cheap about the construction. Good contour for the foot. But. The strap over the foot is snug. Maybe its just me. Idk. I wear socks on my feet while wearing these, thin, almost dress socks. I don't care what you think, I don't care. But I have tried these without socks. Its still snug. Just another 1/2 inch of material would have been perfect. Its my only complaint. Other than that I like these very much. My athletes foot has gone away vs. the crappy slippers that were ""AmAzOn ChOiCe"" and some Lotrimin Ultra. Much more air circulation. I will rate it 4 outta 5 stars. 5 being stupid crazy angel kisses softening every step I take. These are wayyyy better than slippers. Peace out home skillets. Stay safe, vote and hope every step you take is in the right direction.",4,1,17
"I can see these working well for smaller feet. I'm Size 13 (US). All my shoes fit well and are Size 13 (US). These arrived in the box with the Size 13 tag attached, but the arch was too small to fit my foot through. I felt like I was going to break the strap fitting my foot all the way through. They're very light and cheap feeling. I paid around $22, but the moment I picked them up I did not feel like I was holding $22 of value. Returned them, got a refund. I'm glad they work for so many others, but these slides didn't work for me.",2,0,17
The material on these seems decent. The foot shape is not. If you have flat feet I would definitely not get these. The mid foot area is so hard and high it feels like your stepping on a golf ball. After wearing them for a little while stepping on the floor barefoot felt very strange. I could still feel the strange mold of these sandals on my foot.,2,0,17
"I normally love these. I think the batch was made defective since having read a review of same complaint. The top piece that goes over the foot was cut too short. My feet are normal, but can’t hardly slide into the tight space. The foot bed is good. The shoe is not. Will be returning. I will go to a store for another pair.",1,0,17
"These were bought for a competitive swimmer to wear in the locker room and on the pool deck, and they’re a great buy! They’re great for shower use and store easily in a swim bag, and dry without any issues. We’ve also sprayed them with disinfectant and washed them regularly. These are perfect for this kind of use!",5,1,17
"I would recommend sizing up a full size (not a half size), and possibly one and a half sizes if need be. Here is why. I normally wear an 11 or 11.5, and I bought a 12 because the reviews told me to size up, but I definitely would have been better off with a 13. These 12's are right on the edge of being too small for me. Thankfully they're still comfortable.",5,1,17
"What can you say about slides, well for starters these are just about true to size, but if you're like me and get your sandals/slides 1 size larger than your shoes for added comfort, a little padding around the edges if you will, then these are true to that school of thought, in Adidas sneakers I wear a 10 so I got an 11, PERFECT.
I had my third back surgery 10 days ago and have been using these to get around the house in, so if that speaks to their comfort, there you have it, they are a dream for those of you not post op! They have a nice arch support and are firm, but not so firm I'd rather walk barefoot on hardwood floors after surgery, they have a nice give that is responsive and gives a hard rebound, honestly it probably means they will last forever.

-JL",5,1,17
"I ordered these literally to wear at the hospital to give birth and take a shower, so the quality isn't that important to me. They're very lightweight, like the soles are filled with foam. Different than the adidas slides I'm used to from my youth, but that probably explains the low price. Would still recommend as shower shoes.",4,1,17
"The foot strap is completely not flexible. So unless your foot is average or small thickness or width, there is no give to the strap on these at all and will not fit anyone with a higher arch or wider foot. Had to give mine away to someone that normally wears a much smaller size than what these were supposed to fit.",1,0,17
"I’ve never had a slip on like these before. Me and my husband laugh about slip ons like this and call them our prison yard sandales. They look nice but to my surprise they were a size to a size and a half too small! Bummer for me, but my husband got a new pair of slip ons/prison yard sandales. I’m going to reorder a different pair that’s a size bigger. The original size I bought were 10’s. Will try some 11’s now!",3,0,17
"I purchased the blue slides and after a week they seem to be pretty good for what I paid for them. I use my slides every day all day, you will notice a slight hump for the first few days, but slowly you should be able to adjust. The only downside for me is that since it’s a plastic they will make your feet a lil clammy - I may upgrade to a nicer a adidas slide but will do for now.",4,1,17
"I am incredibly disappointed. I ordered male size 11 as I am a 10.5 and I enjoy a little room on my house shoes for comfort. At first, I thought they sent me women's shoes. I think they feel like a 9 because I have to jam my feet in. After about a minute, I'd lose circulation.

I was feeling less hot on Nike and thought I'd go for Adidas. Save your money and look for another shoe because you'll probably give them away. These were supposed to help me keep my floors clean, but all they have done is help keep the Adidas shoebox full.",1,0,17
"My 13 year old son has flat feet and his podiatrist wants him in shoes of some sort all waking hours. Being 13, orthotics aren’t cool. I got him these for his “inside shoes” because they looked to have some build in support. A rarity in slides. He said they feel really good on his feet, even better than his sneakers with inserts. I ended up buying two more pairs. One for outside and one for his soccer bag. His grandpa even ended up ordering a pair for around the house because they’re so comfortable!",5,1,17
Although I love Adidas clothing an shoes I ordered these slides an I had to return them. They were very stiff an the bottoms where ur foot walks on where very hard an they flip flop to me was just very stiff I did t like them at all. I bought a pair of the same in navy blue from the store an they were super soft so I ordered these online thinking they wud be the same but they looked the same but didn’t feel anything like the navy blue pair I bought from the store. I wouldn’t recommend them if your looking for comfort. The gray color was exact as shown but I just couldn’t deal with how stiff they felt on my feet,1,0,17
"I got these because the left one of my old pair of Adidas slide sandals finally came unglued from the base on one side, after many years of use.

It looks like Adidas has cheaped out on these latest ones, made in Vietnam. The previous ones (made in China) were a bit roomier for the same official size 11 and also had an adjustable two-part band with Velcro, plus they had a nice textured insole. These are pretty plane Jane by comparison, and not as comfortable. We'll see if they last.",3,0,17
First off I wear size 12 4E in shoes. I’ve had bad luck with slides strap not fitting over my foot. So I went up to a size 13 and I’m happy with that decision. I really don’t think a 12 would have fit over my foot. Yes they are slightly long but I like them. There is arch support and the slide are a bit stiff yet flexible. I plan to buy another pair! Photo for reference. If you have flat wide feet go up a size!,5,1,17
"I purchased these shoes for my sons to use as shower shoes and to walk around on our hardwood floors (house shoes don't last with these 2). They love the fit, the shoes look good on them and according to them they're comfortable. The shoes are a great quality and look exactly as they do online. I always wait to do reviews to make sure that products hold up well, and these definitely have after a few months of daily wear. Would definitely recommend and purchase again.",5,1,17
"I bought several pairs of Adidas slides and just this pair came in much different and way smaller, even though they’re labeled the same size. They look to be knock offs which is really disheartening considering these came from Amazon. The stitching is different the molding is much cheaper you can’t read the sizes very well they look & feel like knock offs",1,0,17
"I have a pair of Men's 9's identical to what I ordered here. The order says men's 9 and this review popped up as a women's shoe. Regardless, this is not made of the same material, it's hard plastic and not comfortable and is definitely not the same size as the 9's men I ordered from Adidas directly. I would investigate this seller because I highly suspect these are fraudulent products. I'm returning this garbage immediately. If you don't believe me, order a pair of these from Amazon and a pair from Adidas.",1,0,17
"Ordered for my son, who needed a pair of slides that could get wet...he's about a size 12.5 so we ordered the 13. Lengthwise, they are great. He has some room to grow. He says the strap is a little tighter than expected, but he was use to a pair that had been adjustable, but his foot is pretty thin and narrow. They arrived promptly and in great condition...so far he approves of them and really likes the Grey color.",5,1,17
It’s reasonably build for its price. The issue with most such slides/slippers is that the sides rip after a few months of use. Let’s see how this performs. The slides have indentations/groves that are meant to fit the shape of the sole. These indentations can be uncomfortable for some people and I usually don’t like these but the sole is soft enough that it doesn’t bother me. I had an earlier pair that had a harder sole with indentations that made my feet numb. I would recommend this pair.,4,1,17
"My husband loves these, but they are too new to speak of durability yet. He wears an 11 and ordered these in 11. They have at least 1/2"" of extra length, but he likes his shoes exactly that way. He said they're very comfortable, and the slide is super easy to wear.",5,1,17
I wear an 11...ordered an 11...fits like a 9. My son wears a 10 and still could not get his foot in these. I can't even get my toes past the straps. If they are going to sell these like that just say order 2 or 3 sizes bigger. I assure you the 11 is not an 11. Sent them back for a refund.,1,0,17
"I LOVEEE these slides! I’ve been wanting to buy one but it’s so hard to find my size. Finally, I was able to buy it here. I actually got the wrong size but I love that it’s free return, you don’t even need a bag, you can return it in the bag that it came with.
I was able to order the right size and I’m loving it. I’ve used it the whole time I was on vacation. I especially love using it when traveling on a plane because I hate taking off shoes for security. I will definitely purchase again but different colors!",5,1,17
"I have had Adidas sandals before that were amazingly comfy and come in an Adidas box...these time this pair was a big fail, I’m so dissatisfied about the fit, I feel like I have my feet inside a plastic bottle with no support, no good shape, nothing, makes my arch to be stressed, my feet get tired after wearing these for more than an hour awee! I don’t know if these are authentic Adidas “I doubt it”, they came in a clear plastic bag, no box, no wrapping paper. Im so disappointed because I can’t even return them since I’ve already wore them. They’re going to the trash can, waste of money!",1,0,17
"Comfortable. If you use them for shower shoes, be careful. The inside can get slippery if soapy, so hold on to something. True to size.",4,1,17
"These slippers Broke right after the Return Window and they were used only three times. The strap is cheaply glued on the base. They fell apart on the way to the beach from the car, 50 yard walk. My son didn’t even make it to the sand…. Very poor quality. We do not recommend.",1,0,17
"First strike was the fact they're not true to size and the size ordered did not fit me. I expected it to be a little loose based on my shoe size, but instead my foot was sticking out on both ends. They also felt far too plasticky compared to my last two sets. I would not recommend them based on the lousy feel, and the improper sizing.",2,0,17
"Ordered 2 for my sons. Different colors and sizes. By the second day, wearing at a beach resort, their feet and toes had horrible blisters right where the sandal crosses the top of the foot. We’ve never had this issue with competitive brand flip flops/sandals. Will stay away from these Adidas in the future.",2,0,17
Great to use in shower areas. It has good sole grip . It dries out quickly. Upper band is easy to maintain. Very light. Ergonomic design is very confortable. Well finished.,5,1,17
"I am very disappointed in these sliders. They have the Adidas name on them and the famous three bands, but they seem to be a poorly made knock-off. They are constructed so that when I slide my feet inside them, my feet are skewed to the side by the top portion (the part with the bands) and don't fit correctly into the footbed. That makes them very uncomfortable to wear, and they don't stay on well. Could they be a counterfeit imitation?",1,0,17
I ordered up a size for my teenager as the reviews mentioned (he normally wears a size 9.5 to size 10); I ordered the size 11 and my son could not get his foot to slide all the way in because it was too narrow under the band part of the shoe. I am returning and will be ordering something different.,1,0,17
"Nice price point, but my son got painful red marks on top of his feet when wearing them. I tried wearing them, as well (we are the same size), but I also experienced pain and bruising. Cushioning the foot with a pair of socks helps, but certainly doesn't win any fashion awards. Wish I had gone for a different sandal for him.",1,0,17
"These fit great with or without socks. They are super durable and easy to clean. They are insanely comfortable and I have walked 5+ miles in these with no problem. I have bad arches and joints but these are so cushy they make it comfortable to walk.
Update: My first pair stretched out with lots of use so I bought a second pair. I would give these 10 stars if I could.",5,1,17
"I purchased these to slip on when I need to go outside for a few minutes and putting on shoes would take longer than the trip outside will. These fit well over socks and do not slip off when walking around the yard. they have a arch support which is a little more than my other shoes, but not by much. the are comfortable.",5,1,17
Great slides. Purposely ordered the white bottom as I wear them in the house. The darker ones seem to leave marks on the carpet like barefoot marks or wearing shoes in the house. The white seem to eliminate that. Had them for a year and a half very comfortable held up well still wear them daily give it a 10,5,1,17
"I ordered the male equivalent size but these are made for slim feet and because of the padding I always have to squeeze my feet into the slides at first and get used to the feeling.

Also, it wasn’t trimmed properly and so there is extra plastic around the bottom",3,0,17
I ordered these in size 13 for my husband because that’s what he wears in all shoes. I regularly buy him shoes without him having to try them on and they always fit. Well these were too small. He can technically still get his foot in them but they are tight and his heel is right at the edge of the shoe almost falling off. I would recommend ordering a size bigger.,4,1,17
"it was cheap when i bought it. it was around 22 bucks. unfortunately it isn't that comfy compared to the cheap nike's sandals. i ordered the same size as the nike one and this one is way too tight on your feet compared to nike's. if you want to order these i say get 1 size above what you usually get. either way, the tight feeling on your feet (especially sandals) is an uncomfortable feeling, but that's just me.",2,0,17
"These are great sandals. The support is placed wonderfully - it actually makes my back feel good wearing them. You can wear them on the beach and in the water without having to worry about them getting soggy, and in turn moldy/musty. No water will get into these sandals. Only wish they made a bright Kelly Green.",5,1,17
"Important here is that this is the CLOUDFOAM variant of the adilette sandal.
Quite comfortable! Perfect fit for more narrow feet.
The sandal's ""cloudfoam"" sole is softer compared to the Orginal Adilette's sole, but still firm enough to keep its shape when walking.",5,1,17
Are these kids sizes and I misread it? These are way too small for my boyfriend's feet. First pair we got were his normal shoe size and he couldn't even get his feet into them. So we exchanged them for another pair that were 2 sizes bigger and they're still too tight for his feet...,1,0,17
I bought these for my stepdaughter and she loves them. Comfy and cute. I was worried they may be a knock off but they aren’t. Fits perfect. And the best thing about them is the price. Totally worth get an extra pair for a just in case or a back up pair.,5,1,17
"So I have ankle issues from surgeries which made me over supinate. this also (especially in summer) can cause big swelling on my feet and arch area. Since these don't have any give, it just doesn't work. my feet won't fit comfortable with the strap. That being said, I could feel they were well made and cushioned, so a normal foot person would do fine I think.",5,1,17
"I'm not a big fan. I've had other Adidas slides and liked them better. These slides have a big cushion in the middle of the foot, which might seem like a good idea, but I thought it felt odd and a little uncomfortable actually. Worse, though, is that the strap on top began to rub or dig into my foot --the back edge of the strap toward the heel. I have a red mark where it has rubbed my skin. And I was just wearing it around the house. Seems like it would be much worse if I were walking for a while.",3,0,17
"You will definitely need to go up at least one size. My size 8 was waaay too small. My feet hurt trying to break them in around the house for a couple hours. It was so bad, I returned them the same day they arrived! Didn’t bother getting a new pair. I’ll just take my refund.",1,0,17
"The product was very uncomfortable, and the seller would have charged me about 80% of the cost to ""return"" them. Ridiculous. If shoes don't fit or feel right, they should be free returns if never worn. Will never buy from this seller again.",2,0,17
"Don't buy these sandals. When i received them i tried them on and the greases feeling on the sandals made me take them off and clean them with hot soapy water. It didn't do any good to clean them, they felt just as greases. Also the size is off by one size to small. Not worth the money. Invest in a better sandal. By the way mine are now in the trash, wasted $20.00 bucks. i will never buy an Adidas again.",1,0,17
"The shoes took a few days to stretch to their normal size. They're perfect now. I've been wearing them since June with no problems. I was a little unsure about the quality because I saw other people say theirs was ripped at a very weak seam. I have the same weak seam, however the shoe is still holding up.",5,1,17
I bought these for myself (they were cheaper than the women’s). I usually wear a size 9.5 in women’s (somewhat of a wide foot). Ordered these in the men’s 8. They fit great. My heel is almost to the edge but it’s okay. Super comfortable and cute. Don’t look too big. I’ve worn them all day and they haven’t rubbed the top of my foot at all. I just googled what my size would be in Mens.,5,1,17
"Had maybe a week, before the strap going over the foot started cracking. Plus if you want to constantly slip while walking cause the material does not act kindly to those who’s feet sweat. You should definitely buy these, because they’ll make your life more adventurous with not knowing the next time you’ll eat it when trying to walk to the refrigerator to get a snack.",1,0,17
I got these for my boyfriend and he has regular feet not narrow not wide and it feels like these slides are meant for men with dainty paper thin feet. His foot did not make it in under the strap so we returned and got him some Nikes,2,0,17
"These shoes fit me but they are a little too thick on the soles. If I had tried them on at the store I would’ve never purchased them. Not the end of the world, I will still use them, but it will take a while for the my feet to get used to them. Also they are a little hard for a rubber sandal.",4,1,17
"I ordered these for my son, but he wasn't a fan. Luckily they fit me too! I ordered a 7 in men's and they fit perfect. (I wear a 9 in women's.) The only thing is that if you wear without socks you'll get little black things on your feet when they sweat. I remember a pair I used to have doing the same thing and I think it's just because of the material they're made of.",5,1,17
"the stitching on the inside of the inside top has rubbed my feet raw! this has to be a design flaw or I got a bad pair.
I will not be able to wear these without socks which is useless. I hope they will accept a return as they have been worn outside.",1,0,17
"These run small. I ordered a men’s size 7 for my son, which is his normal shoe size (he’s 12), these were way too small. His heel hung off the end about 1” and his toes were all the way at the top of the slide. Ugh! By the way, his foot from heel to toe is 9” even, I ordered a size 7 just to be safe and they were still at least an inch too short for him.",3,0,17
"We are going south for a vacation and the Husband needed pool / ocean shoes. He generally wears an 11 in Teva's or a 10 1/2 in other styles, but we ordered a 10 and they fit him fine. Comfortable and supportive. We got the black/white stripe pair and he is very happy with them.",5,1,17
"Product fit perfectly, and would have been absolutely perfect if they weren't broke coming straight out of the box. The box was also not so pretty and looked like it went through h*ll and back. However, I made an exchange and sent them back. I did recieve another pair within a few days but we chose white this time and nothing was wrong, fit perfectly and very comfy. Still waiting to hear if amazon has received our return item, because im a little worried they may charge if they don't receive it.",1,0,17
"The sizing was off. Too small. I normally wear a size 10.5(US). Got the 11 and they barely make the right foot length and the top strap (over the top of the foot part) is too tight. Should have gotten a 12. Other than that, they are nice quality and nice bright color works well with the white stripes. Quick drying! While I get dressed they dry from soaking wet in under 10 minutes to packable dry state.",4,1,17
Not all that comfortable not a true 12 a bit short kinda high up for a slide ... almost like a woman’s shoe ... wore them around the house for a week with and without socks to try and get use to them ... will get a better pair before summer and save these as back ups they were cheap enough...,3,0,17
I ordered a size 4 men for my 10 year old who is a size 5/6 in women’s and it was way too small! I sent it back and ordered a size 6 and then fit great. It was a little big but plenty of room for growth. My daughter he loves them now so I would recommend you order a size or two bigger.,5,1,17
The size for a 5 is way to small the slide itself is cute but the sizes really run small idk maybe because I tried to order in a boys for a cheaper price but around the time they didn’t have my size anyway so I chose a 5 and it came smaller than what I expected,3,0,17
"this is the second time I got this for my son. Unfortunately, the size 11 slides that I recently got him was too small. He is 13 and weara 10.5 in men but I’m guessing his feet grew lol I will have to get him a size larger and just keep the other one for his dad",5,1,17
"The strap on these Adidas Men's Adilette Shower Slide are too small.
I purchased a size 13 pair, while the shoe itself could fit my foot the strap where I slide in my foot in only allowed about 3/4 of my foot to fit making these shoes useless. While I have a large foot I do not have a swollen or particularly wide or fat foot. I would avoid this product.",1,0,17
Great shoes. Ordered to use as shower shoes at the gym. One star deducted as the shoes are a bit more narrow than expected while the rest of the shoe fits comfortably. May just be a personal preference on feel.,4,1,17
It's not Adidas' fault. I have wide feet and I thought that perhaps it would be elastic enough for my feet. I was wrong and so I returned it. I went ahead and bought one of those shower sandals with velcro strap.,4,1,17
My husband LOVES these shoes and requested I get more for him. I thought he was being goofy about his love for them until I tried them on myself. They’re soooo soft and comfy!!! I can see why he likes them. They’re a great price too!,5,1,17
"Lo que más me gustó es como se ajustan al pie. Ya tenía otras, las que tienen puntas en la planta, pero estan son mejores.
What I liked the most is how they fit. I already had other Adidas ( with massage nubs) but these are superior.",5,1,17
"This is quality/well made, but I sent it back and opted for something less expensive. It was too much money even for the quality to spend on flip flops. I mean they are just plastic/rubber and you can find them cheaper that fit well and do the job. I just wanted them for the beach or gym.",2,0,17
"**Edited: Received the 10 and they’re great. Order up 1-2 sizes with these shoes.

These are nice, but run very small. Sizes are like a US women’s sizing. I bought these in an 8, for my son who wears a men’s 8, but they were too small. Would have fit me perfectly. I returned them and purchased a 10. Easy to return.",5,1,17
"1: these shoes are way too small! I bought them for my teenage son and my 10 year old daughters little skinny feet wouldn’t fit in them.
2: I returned these April 21, it’s May 23rd and I still haven’t gotten my refund! Don’t waste your time or money.",1,0,17
My son is a 13 Adult and got a 13 Adult but runs small and snug so go a size up for better fit,4,1,17
"First the sandals look great and my feet don't feel slippery when they are wet. The sandals have and arch to them which was a surprise and feels uncomfortable to me. The strap over the toes feels ridged and when walking it cause the strap to dig into the top of foot. It might take some breaking in, so I'll post a follow in a few days.",3,0,17
"A review from my daughter:

I wear a size 8 in Women's, sometimes an 8.5. I ordered a Men's 7 (equivalent to a Women's 9) thinking it'd be a little roomy. I was wrong. Even the Men's 7, which should be a half size big on me, is too small. I'm keeping them anyway, in hopes that they mold to my feet a bit.",4,1,17
It fits in length but it’s tight on your foot and it seems to be cheap quality...Also like I said it fits the length of your food but the shoe fits very tight maybe after it broke and it might feel better but I’m only keeping the product because it was cheap enough not to return it,2,0,17
My teenage son is happy with these slides and he's wearing them nonstop since I bought them for him. He's a basketball player and he appreciates the ability to change in and out of these in the locker room. Also great for the pool.,5,1,17
"The footbed is unsupportive, and the strap is uncomfortably tight--I have high arches so I could not slide my feet into the sandals except painfully. I won't have this problem now as they are in the garbage can!",1,0,17
"The soles are a bit more stiffs and the top as well, I recommend the Adillette Comfort instead as all around house shoe, these are better for swimming pools and possibly the beach but they discolor from seawater, especially when dark color. Good all around but a bit stiff top that is somewhat chafing.",4,1,17
They look great but they are very cheaply made. I've been wearing mine around the house for only a week and the strap arch has completlely detached from the base of the shoe rendering them useless. By the looks of it the strap was connected to the bass with nothing more than glue. Consider I only wear them to walk from my desk to the kitchen they should have lasted allot longer than a week.,1,0,17
"Can’t go wrong with Adilettes… got them for my husband and ended up buying one pair for myself. They don’t look as cute as other sandals but they’re as comfy as comfy can get! And for a fraction of the price, I would say go for it.",5,1,17
"I bought these as my old pair of Adidas slippers were worn out and I wanted a pair of similar design. The old pair served me a long period; I hope the new one should last a while too. Comfort wise, these feel the same as or slightly better than the old ones. They appear to be make of the same materials and similar levels of quality. I would recommend these for daily domestic use.",5,1,17
"I wear a size 10.5 medium shoe and I purchased the next half size up an 11 medium. The shoe was too tight and too short to be an 11. And yes, the box read an 11 medium. I did wear the shoe for 3 weeks without any significant movement of the shoe to fit the contours of my foot. If the fit was correct, this would be a very comfortable and stable shoe.",2,0,17
Leave these in the sun one time and they will be junk. The old version didn’t shrink in the sun. The new ones are far inferior and if you leave them by the pool once you’ll come back to slides that is three sizes smaller. So disappointing.,1,0,17
My husband wanted these to wear back and forth to the hot tub. He can also use them when showering if need be. He said they are comfortable and fit like they should. They don't have a whole lot of support so he would not go on for a walk in them. But they work great for going to the hot tub and are waterproof!,5,1,17
"Got these for my husband & they are NOT for men with wide feet- AT ALL. His feet aren’t even exceptionally wide, we have never had any other problems with any normal width shoes, so I figured these would be fine. He couldn’t get his foot into these at all. Not good for anyone with a wide foot!",1,0,17
There is no way these are real Adidas. I have several slides and they are all so comfortable and Soft and most importantly say ADIDAS on them. These dont. They’re hard. There’s not bend to them so they hurt and nowhere on these do they say adidas. It’s like they’re made out of plastic. My feet want to slide around in them.,1,0,17
"These are supposed to be used for just the shower but I use them for everyday usage. Because of that, I definitely feel my feet get sweatier than other slippers. They are pretty basic as far as comfort but feel durable. Time will tell. I would buy another set but only for the bathroom/pool/spa. They would have to be dedicated to wet scenarios.",3,0,17
my son didnt ask for them but we live in a hot state and i like to prepare for six months of summer ahead of time. the price was right. true fit to size. i would have preferred red for him but went with the more frugal option. if you know what size you need and like the look then it's pretty straight forward. and actually they look better in person.,4,1,17
"Idk why the strap has to be so tight. My fiance is skinny, and doesn't have chubby feet or anything. It's weird how tight the strap is. Should've gotten one that allows you to change the tightness. Ugh.",3,0,17
"Not that comfortable after long periods of time, however I mostly use them to shower, they are great and dry really fast.
They did come a bit smaller than other adidas slides I have
But overall good slides",4,1,17
"These slides cut up the tops of my feet. I wore them for about 2 days, they weren’t comfortable but I figured maybe they needed to be broken in. When I was going to bed the second night, the tops of my feed were irritated. The next day I could see they were scratched up from them. Super weird. First time going with Adidas slides too, won’t be trying again.

Also, I bought a size 12, which is what I wear in every type of shoe or slide. I’ve worn size 12 slides for over 10 years. Just wanted to clarify that they weren’t too small.",2,0,17
"I wear a 9.5 in other Adidas, so I ordered a 10 In these. The length is perfect leaving about an inch for my foot to move around, but the strap is loose. I’d order a 9, but I worry that they’d leave my heel at the edge of the sole or off the sole. I’ll probably just wear these around the house since they fly off if I’m not careful.",3,0,17
 Got these slides for my boyfriend on Halloween he loves them he wears them all the time they fit as expected. Size 11 they are comfy and really soft lol I would recommend getting a pair I steal them from him haha. My fav part is they are easy to clean as well,5,1,17
Got these thinking its same as all black but I was wrong. These were not as comfortable as the all black ones. So I returned these for the black ones with I have 2 pairs and my wife has one too. The black is more comfortable compared to these.,3,0,17
Definitely not like the normal cloud like Adidas slides but the color is nice. If I could do it again I would’ve just went to the real site or a sporting goods store and bought the better ones. Theses are simply for the pool so it’s ok.,3,0,17
"They may be called shower slippers, but these shoes never leave my husband's feet until he changes into boots or sneakers. They don't slide off when he walks and there is nothing pinching under the foot at the strap like many others of this type.",5,1,17
I ordered size 10 since my feet are around 10.5 inches and it was specified as 10.7 in for this size. I was not disappointed when I put them on. The heel support and the ergonomic design on the ball of the foot makes this short slide the best I’ve worn. I had to order navy since black was sold out but I’m happier with the navy look otherwise. I have had them for about a month and there are no signs of tear or any flattening around the sole. I’m super happy with their durable construction and their iconic design.,5,1,17
Pretty decent slides for the price pretty comfortable to me however I can see why people say it can be a little uncomfortable it has a little curve to it so if you like flat shoe this is not for you also it is a really fitted slipper so if you want to have a little more room definitely order a size or 2 up,4,1,17
"I chose a men's 8 because I wear and a womens9 and wanted that extra .5 for wiggle room...fit like a women's 8 so I sent it back and got a 10 and they fit better but its deff not a men's 10 lol weird weird sizing, I only wear adidas though<3. Love the style and super comfy and lightweight",5,1,17
This order was returned and a refund requested but the refund was not returned to my account. It was instead placed on a GIFT card and an additional sum also moved from my account to the GIFT card. I do not wish to have a GIFT card. Please return the funds to my account.,1,0,17
"This not what i ordered... and I live outside the US.
I ordered a particular pair of slippers, I just received them from the person who brought it for me and to realise that what I ordered is not what I got.
And to make matters worse they dont fit.
Adidas is my favorite brand and when I purchase a particular item I expect to get that exact item.
If it's not available let me know so at least I can make a decision.
I AM DISAPPOINTED",1,0,17
"Best slides on the market! I have narrow feet and have always had a hard time wearing slides but these fit perfectly and don't slide off my feet at all. They're also super comfortable and extremely lightweight, I definitely recommend.",5,1,17
"I think it's fake, if not and this is original Adidas, shame on them! It feels really good, but after 1 month use they are reaching for the sky :)))) you can see on the picture how their form changes. It would be understandable if it happened 6 month or 1 year later but after one month?! Shame on you Adidas :)",3,0,17
"I've had a pair of these as shower shoes for years, and my wife borrowed them a few weeks back and raved about how comfy they were (and wouldn't give them back). I bought her these to have her own pair and she wears them more than any other shoe she used to wear around the house (including slippers).",5,1,17
Tight fit. Adidas has changed the slide over the years. I preferred the old style without all the different supports. Not as comfortable as before but will do for short periods of time. Seller gets 5 stars.,3,0,17
"Husband wears a size 9.5-10. Had to order 11 and it fits, a little snug at first but over time, but will stretch after a little while now it’s the perfect fit. Order size up if you’re wanting a pair.",4,1,17
"I actually bought the blue size 6 for my Father's day gift. He said it fit fine and could even wear with socks. I also bought a white pair in size 5 for my mom. She said it was a little tight because she has wide feet and the top of her feet are high. They switched, both are happy. I decided to get the gray size 7 in men's even though I'm a woman; my feet are wide. They fit perfectly. We're all happy. All is well in my world.",5,1,17
"Looks and feels cheap. All plastic. My both feet are the same size, but while the left shoe fits well, the right is too tight. I hope to be able to stretch it a bit, little by little.",3,0,17
"Stitching/thread at top of foot piece rubbed and caused a sore. I think I have fixed this via cleaning and rubbing/sanding the rough area. Sole is very stiff, hence the durability rating - but that does make the comfort score lower. Overall not bad now that I have fixed the issue and broken them in a bit.",4,1,17
"Replaced Adidas Carozoon slides size 11. First pair of Adilette size 11 I sent back, more like a size 10. So I got size 12 which are a snug fit. I like these slides for shower, others are not all rubber so stay wet.",4,1,17
I ordered a size to small but I an ordering another pair . The sandal feels light weight I was scared to purchase because of the reviews . It shows the sandal either shrinking when wet or the entire top part coming off. I decided to give them a chance and with the experience so far they look and feel comfterble.,4,1,17
"Originally gave 5 stars but as you can see, Just 37 days later & wore less than 10 times & its falling apart. Obviously not durable. Returns cut off at 30 days. If they can't make a product that holds up better than this they should give it up. Will never buy again.",2,0,17
"I was looking for a reasonably priced slide sandal (nothing between the toes) that I could wear to the beach, and this does the trick. If you wear a half size, order the next whole size above.",5,1,17
"My husband usually wears a size 12 but we got the 13 for ""comfort"" and they were way to tight on my his feet. We figured that they might stretch over time but he felt like the strap would cut into his toes and we didn't want that. They seem like good slides but we had to return them. Now we aren't sure if a 14 will work or if we need to try a different brand.",3,0,17
There is no padding on the underside of the strap that goes over your foot. The result for me was that the seam at the front of the strap rubbed against the top side of my toes. Very uncomfortable and it was immediately clear that these wouldn't work for me. This was returned and I found a better pair elsewhere.,2,0,17
"Very uncomfortable to wear, feels too much squeezed. Feels like walking on a hard stone. The size chart is wrong-headed order one size more than what it says yours might be. For return/replacement, they are asking me to pay $6 towards the UPS store. Eff that.",1,0,17
They run small. I bought an 8 for my son and they don’t fit that should’ve given him room for growth but they barely fit now and he’s still growing. I kept them for myself they fit me fine but I’m ordering 2 sizes up for him.,4,1,17
"Purchased to use as a shower shoe at work and for traveling. There is no doubt that they are waterproof. That’s the good, the bad is that they are not comfortable at all because they are so firm.",2,0,17
"These are perfect for my daughter who is a swimmer / life guard. They are softer than the ones my son and I wear and the strap is not adjustable. They work for her, not sure about the durability. Our older ones with the hard nubby soles seem more durable?",5,1,17
Looks very nice it is comfortable besides the logo underneath your feet that you can feel it while you walking besides that I will buy maybe a half size larger but will definitely buy it again good product it is durable for children,3,0,17
"These have to be cheap knock offs. We have purchased several pairs of these slides and my kids will wear through the soles but they have never just fallen apart. These are super cheap and the strap came off of the bottoms after only a couple of months. Don't waste your money on these, just order directly from adidas.",1,0,17
"Purchased these for my husband. He typically wears an 11.5 in men's, so I purchased a 12. They were too small, soi ended up keeping them. I wear a 10.5 in women's and they are just a tad bit long but not too long to keep me from enjoying them poolside. Recommend ordering up for men's.",4,1,17
"These are ok if you wear socks with your sandals, the material sticks to your feet when humid, an my feet are normal or less in humidity.",3,0,17
This is my second time buying I gave the amount of stars I gave because they do run very small so I recommend sizing up. Other than that they are great comfortable wash as well just had to get a size larger for my husband.,3,0,17
"There's really not much support for these shoes, but they are comfortable and easy to clean. I assume when buying shoes like these you are looking for something easy to clean and easy to slip on, not for the support.",5,1,17
"I'm usually a size 8.5 women's and a 7 in men's (sometimes a 7 men's in Adidas is a smidge big due to the width). So I bought the 7's thinking they'd be perfect. I couldn't even get my foot in them. Like at all. They were ridiculously small. I don't know if they all run small or if I just got a pair that were incorrectly sized. That said, the return policy was stellar and I had no issues getting a refund.",3,0,17
Got my 11 year old son these in size 6. These fit more of a size 6 in a big kid size. I bought him another Adidas pair of slides in Men's size and there he fit a size 5. These are great quality. He uses these for baseball so he can wear these in between games while he doesn't wanna wear his cleats.,5,1,17
"We liked these sandals at first but they quickly have shrunk in size too much when we left them outdoors on the patio (despite being Spring time). Their shapes also deformed quickly (the back of the sandal got curved making it very uncomfortable).
Unfortunately I cannot recommended them.",1,0,17
"These are comfortable for use in the house, not to be used in the shower or anywhere where there is water. The material absorbs the water and it takes a long time to dry. I’m concerned about mold… but I still use them. Keeping an eye out. The worst is when I used them to shower after being at the pool, and driving home with the AC on and wet feet the entire time.",3,0,17
"Tried to upsize and replace my son's exact pair in size 4 with a size 5. They are identical. Model, color, everything. I checked they said 5 and measured width and length. Identical to his size 4 he is growing out of.",3,0,17
I was hesitant on buying these as I'm picky about my slip ons and the previous ones I had are no longer sold which were super comfy and soft. After break in these sandals mirrored the ones I loved.,5,1,17
"Made of cheap material, and it smelled used upon arrival... gross. Better off saving over half your money and getting something from Walmart, which would be just as good and doesn't smell

Edit: after rinsing them off initially and wearing them in, i use them everyday and am a fan. 2/5 to 4/5 stars",4,1,17
"Updated sep 14th
Really disappointed about the product,it’s not even been one month,the sandal already starts breaking.
I’m a women size 6.5,I got a men size 4. A little bit small. But it looks really cute. I just hope it won’t break like the other customers showed.",1,0,17
They fit as expected. That's the only good thing about these. I wore them for about 20 minutes and the bottoms of my feet were super sweaty. I would definitely not buy these again. I went right back to wearing my And1 sandles.,1,0,17
Awesome shower shoes. I broke 2 pairs of cheap flip flops early on during this deployment so I searched for some shower shoes that looked like they would last. I like that the soles are thick which works great for small amounts of standing water. I can tell they’re not going to tear and the insoles are cushioned which is much more comfortable!,5,1,17
"I wish I'd read the reviews before I bought these. I've worn size 11 my entire adulthood, but I had to shove to fit my foot under the strap on these. At LEAST a size too small. I had to return them and go up to a 12. Otherwise, I assume they're fine (hence the 5-star review).",5,1,17
"I’ve ordered three black pairs already and haven’t been satisfied with either one. The first two pairs were slightly damaged and obviously used. The third was new, but the sole support on one of them was flat. I’m looking to buy them again because I really want a pair in good condition. They are really comfortable, but I won’t settle for a pair in bad condition.",3,0,17
"I love my slides. Bought them in black and white and wear both all the time. I absolutely love them. Whether wearing indoor or outdoor they’ve remained clean, or easy to wipe down, comfy, and lightweight. I highly recommend purchasing a pair or two for yourself. You won’t be disappointed.",5,1,17
"Pretty upset, I received these slides 6/19/18 and today out of nowhere they ripped on me 7/30/18. The date to return or what I was hoping to exchange them was 7/19/18. How convenient. Pretty upset as these were super comfortable and my first pair of slides ever. Hopefully I can get them replaced",2,0,17
My son swims and these are great for the pool. He's not particulary hard on them but they are holding up well. He says the footbed is comfortable. He wears a 13 and these fit just fine.,5,1,17
"I love these shoes, but I had to return and go a size up. I normally wear a size 12 shoe and these are not wide enough for a size 12 wide. But its a great shoe once you get the right size",4,1,17
My Dad has an old pair of slip-ons that he is literally walking out of because they are fabric. This slip-on is solid and just perfect; he loves them and wears them everyday. Thanks!,5,1,17
"I returned these a day after I received them. These didn't smell like rubber when I opened them up, they smelled like stinky smelly athletes foot!! It was disgusting!!!! I don't know if it was because it was during the summer and they were hot on the truck all day, or they were previously worn by someone with athletes foot. It was awful!!!!",1,0,17
I had to give them a couple of days to stretch out to my wide foot. I am glad i waited it out. The sole is amazing. I don't have to use my pad mat at my stand up desk if I am wearing these. Great for the price. I was skeptical at first. Took about a week to break in.,5,1,17
"The slides are far too tight to be at all comfortable. I find myself just dealing with the soreness they produce for my feet any time I have to use them. I have attempted to let them loosen up through regular use and I have even tried to simply stretch them out myself. However, these slides are horribly proportioned. I have never had a problem with tightness before with adidas, or any other footwear brand at this size. I suspect my pair will find its way to a thrift store, or landfill. Either way I hope whoever finds them has feet proportioned like a particularly narrow fish spatula.",1,0,17
I got a size 12 I always get a size 12 every time I get shoes or sandals or flip-flops. for whatever reason this didn’t fit. Maybe go for a size up or try to find a wider size. I gave mine away to a friend. They fit him perfectly but that’s because he wears a size 11.,1,0,17
These are perfect for what I bought them for. Great for slipping on to go outside. They broke in pretty quickly and are comfortable for short walks. Had for a couple weeks and seem to be pretty durable. They fit as expected but if you like a looser fit consider going up half or full size.,5,1,17
I feel like I lost $25 dollars. This shoe and whatever the size would be is considered a narrow.,1,0,17
"Purchased Scarlet/White. My son loves them and he wears them daily. However, the red tints the bottom of his socks a little. The pink/red stain does come out when you wash but that is the only complaint",4,1,17
"Great price, and the sole feels comfy but they are a bit tight around my foot. I have skinny feet and even bought a half size up…still a bit tight. Perhaps they will stretch out over time?",4,1,17
"Surprised to find such good quality! I got the red color and it totally stands out. Very comfy and able to wear them all the time. I am size a women’s 8.5, I bought men’s 7. Wish there were more colors my size, I would’ve bought more",5,1,17
"I bought a pair of these in black two years ago and they are extremely comfortable. They are so comfortable that I wanted a second pair. These are not the same at all even though they are the same size, style, and brand. The loop over the top is a lot tighter and is generally uncomfortable. I am returning and buying something else.",2,0,17
"I don’t think these are the same as before. I have bought several pairs over the years which felt as soft as a wrestling gym mat.

These however, are hard as hell and I wonder if they’re real adidas.

I’ll try find the other buyer and spend the $30. On a good note the Grey color looks nice and for $13 it’s ok.",3,0,17
this slippers is not just for shower like it says you can wear it any and everywhere you want i ordered this slippers for my 11 year old son when it came i loved it because we both wears the same size i went ahead and ordered me a white one and also ordered another one for my 9 year old son too.,5,1,17
My son lost his other pair of slide which were Nike and I could not see paying another $40 for slides. These are a great value for 1/2 the price. He mentioned that the feel up by the toes is weird but that he is getting it used to it. The shoes arrived within a reasonable time.,5,1,17
Love them I suggest you get a size or two bigger than your shoe size I wear ten and half and ordered 12s and fit perfect ...,4,1,17
"I normally wear a size 9 in womens, but my feet are too wide for the women's slides to fit comfortably so I ordered a size 8 in men's and they fit perfect. Super comfortable, easy on and off, and great to wear around the house with wood floors to save my arch. Now I want more colors!",5,1,17
They came used with dirt on the bottom and the box was completely beat to hell. Ordered another and noticed it had a the paper in the shoes like you would get in the store. So I guess they don’t check wether the product is worn or not.,1,0,17
"They look great and they are made out of a nice material. However, they seem very tight. I bought them for my father but they were too tight for him so I wear them. But they were too tight for my fit too. So i gave them to my wife but she didnt like them. So now I gave them to my mother but she says she will give them to my sister’s kid. So here you go. 4 ppl had them but no one wants to wear then.",3,0,17
"I’m a size 10 and a half in every day shoe size, they didn’t have these in that size so I figured I should go with an 11. The strap that goes over the foot is just a bit low so I have to really pull the sandal over my foot, and then it slowly starts coming off while walking.",4,1,17
"They were a little larger than the size, but not too big a deal. I use them for things like going to play golf. easy slide on and off when putting on or taking off golf shoes, and can wear them over the golf socks. (Can't do that with flip-flops or other types)",4,1,17
"They look pretty cool, and the materials are decent. They really hurt my feet though. The arch supports are in the wrong places, and the straps pinch, even though I sized up.",2,0,17
"They're nice for around the house, but If you plan on wearing socks with them, go up a size. I guess I should have figured that out since they are technically shower sandals, not house slippers.",4,1,17
Besides the size running about a full size smaller they are extremely comfortable. Probably the most comfortable slides We’ve bought. My husband wears a size 10 to 10.5 sneakers so I ordered an 11. He will definitely need a size 12. So make sure to order a size larger than you would usually wear.,3,0,17
I purchased this as a gift for my brother and the sizing is very small. These run very narrow and are definitely not for those with wide and or larger feet. It was pricey to send it back so I ended up just giving them to another family member.,3,0,17
"I actually returned my real size and ordered a size up but the band is just way too tight around my foot, and I don’t even wear wide footwear, I wear regular just fine! I can still manage it, but the band that wraps around the foot is just way too tight. Will not be purchasing these again.",2,0,17
I bought these for my son. I’ve bought these multiple times for both my boys. They really like them. They slide on easily. I can hose them off when they get dirty. They fit them well. Plus they don’t have the in between the toes thing like a flip flop that hurts their feet.,5,1,17
I purchased these sandals for my son's birthday. I thought the sandals were going to have a soft material so when you step it's smooth not hard. I wasn't looking for the hard plastic kind. I did keep the sandals. didn't want to go through sending them back. Maybe someone else would like that kind of sandal. It just wasn't what I was looking for.,3,0,17
"I’ve bought at least a dozen pairs of Adidas Slides over the years, but these don’t fit like the previous ones. The instep is too high so my feet don’t stay as secure. I don’t think I’ll order more unless I can try them on first.",3,0,17
I would definitely size up on these slides. My husband wears a 10.5-11 and I bought him the 11. His heel went over the back rim causing them to be uncomfortable. Score for me I have a new pair! 🤓 The shoe itself is very comfortable and I wore them most of an 8 hour day at the water park.,4,1,17
I bought these for my wife. She wears an 8.5 size in woman's so I ordered an 8 in men's. Could have gone a little smaller but they're fine. Durable and comfy. We are pleased with these. Recommended.,4,1,17
"Well I didn't care for them personally, my old feet needed more comfort. My son on the other hand loves them he stated that they were very comfortable for him. He is flat-footed and says they feel very supportive. I will update in a few months and review the durability and comfort then.",4,1,17
"I love the comfort of the slides. Very durable and they have great support. Perfect for me. A little bigger even after measuring my foot with the size chart but, I’ll be keeping them.",5,1,17
These were for my son for after soccer games and practices. His foot measured 10.5 inches and I purchased a 10. It fit but right to the toe so I bought him another pair for inside the house use when he slips his outdoor shoes off at the door and I bought an 11. 👍,5,1,17
"My husband did not like these. I ordered his regular size and he said they were too small and slipped around on him. They smelled funny and had a cheap plasticky feel to them. I swapped them for the Adidas ""comfort slides"" version, which are more expensive. But he says those are more true to size and way more comfortable and don't feel cheap.",2,0,17
I've worn a 10.5 Adidas sneaker most of my life. These shoes are barely to big for my wife size 6. The description said accurate sizing so I did I would like to exchange this 11 for a 13,2,0,17
"These like many other slides are way too narrow. My husbandcwears a 10.5. I git an 11 and he could not get his foot in at all. No, he's not fat either. I guess these are for European men? No clue",1,0,17
"After bad experience with Under Armor slides, the Adidas are better but not perfect. Only slides that I've found to be more comfortable are Foot Joys but their durability is poor. I find that I can't wear the Adidas slides for more than an hour.",4,1,17
"I bought a pair in the beginning of July. Only used them to wear out to the pool/hot tub at my house. They fit well but the rubber caused irritation and rashes if you walk in them while they are wet (or your feet are wet).

The strap popped off today, not even 3 months later. Check out my photos. For the price, I’d expect these to last a bit longer than 2.5 months. Maybe I just got a bad pair, idk…",2,0,17
"Too stiff. Does not conform to your foot shape to make for an easy slip on. I have to use my hands to pull it all the way on and then its not ""comfortable"".",3,0,17
"I'd gotten these in blue about 2 years ago to wear around the house, and loved them. Now I bought a second pair in red to have for outside use. They fit perfectly, they give my arches excellent support--and I wear molded arches in my shoes--and they're great for walking!",5,1,17
I bought them for my boyfriend and he said they were comfortable and fit good. He is a size 11.,5,1,17
"This may have been made for ducks not for human it most certainly did not fit I tried stepping on it, squeezing my feet in and with no progression I could not get my foot in properly. You may want to order a size or two larger I'm prepared to have over 2 inches of extra sandal in front and back sticking out of your foot.",1,0,17
"Fit is great. Support is alright. They're pretty good, tbh. But I can't get over the rigid top-foot band that kinda digs into my feet... I will look for some that are more flexible or elastic on the top band. I'm a female and I wear size 8 in men's or 10 in women's. US sizing. :)",3,0,17
These run a little wide in my opinion. I bought them for my husband and they are loose fitting on him. But length is spot on and besides them slipping here and there they are durable and very comfortable!!,5,1,17
So comfy! I have plantar fasciitis and spend a fortune on Birkenstock’s because they are known for arch support. These fit my foot like a aloft glove AND support my bad arch. Wish I had found these years ago. Even if they wear out faster I could buy 4 of these for 1 Birkenstock.,5,1,17
"The Adidas website has Adilettes that are slightly more expensive at $30 but feel a lot better than these ones. These feel less durable and comfortable in comparison, although they are much lighter for walking around in.",3,0,17
This are comfortable. They were not a bad price either. A couple of my white stripes are cracking already which totally stinks. Now ill only wear around the house. Bought them for myself for christmas.,4,1,17
"Like many other review mentioned, these run SMALL. I normally wear an 11-12 so I took the advice and ordered a 13 thinking they might be too big but instead they are still very snug. I only need them to walk to and from the gym shower so for the price, I'm still happy with them. Just don't be afraid to go big with them.",4,1,17
"These are fake!! I ordered my son a size 6 in kids size and a 7 in men's for me. His are bigger than mine!! Also, the bottom has a large bump that makes it impossible to walk!",1,0,17
So comfortable got my boyfriend a pair for Christmas I love that they’re not the ones with the spikes. Wanted a pair for myself even got my brothers gf a pair too so comfy!!,5,1,17
"I ordered these thinking they were like my previous pair no they are pre molded for someone's foot. Not mine, probably not yours but maybe Cinderella? They are hard uncomfortable and I hate them zero stars. Tried to return that was a scam",1,0,17
This show is very uncomfortable it runs extremely small and extremely narrow it's the absolute worst slide on shoe I ever purchased in my life ..very cheaply made and I would advise to stay away from them never buy these narrow tiny shoes.,1,0,17
"I've not gone easy on these slides, but they are holding up. If they ever come apart at the glue I'll update my review. They seem possible to clean to some degree, so they look pretty clean even still. I like them. Simple look, comfortable fit.",5,1,17
"I got these for my boyfriend before vacation. He loved them! Said they are comfortable, supportive and liked the colors. So far no breaking or ripping anywhere. I ordered a size up because of previous reviews and happy I did. His normal size would have been too small.",5,1,17
"The most comfortable thing I’ve ever worn. I love the support and cushion it has. If there’s anything wrong with it is, if your foot is in the right place it will create a vacuum and you’ll start making farting sounds with your feet.",5,1,17
This sandals are for mens but they have the chart size if you want to buy for a women and it recommend me to buy a size 6 at first I doubt it but when my order arrived I try them and fit perfect.,5,1,17
Really comfortable. I was actually surprised at how comfortable they are. They cradle your foot nicely. Will definitely buy again. Had to purchase another pair for my son as well.,4,1,17
"I wear these mostly around the house, but they're durable enough (I think, haven't had them that long) for walking around outside. I bought these in part to bring on a bicycle trip. They're very light and pack into a small space.",5,1,17
"Decent water sandals. But my son wears a 11 1/2 shoe, and the 11 sandal was much too small. The size 12 is still a little small. Order at least one size up!",5,1,17
"Good quality but run way to small said men’s size 11 but gave them to my mom who they fit perfectly and she is a size 9 women’s, plus slim fit. Would not buy these again. That’s my mom wearing my men’s size 11 😫",3,0,17
"I'm normally a 10 or 10.5 size but even a size 11 in these shoes are much too short and narrow for my feet. Looks like they'll be going back. I will say that they seem well constructed and the insoles are comfortable, but it's hard to give a full review when I can't walk very well in them.",3,0,17
"If you have a wide foot, go up a size. I got this for my son. They are too tight for him. Usually sandals with just one strap works for him. I can wear them so I kept them.",4,1,17
"We bought these as indoor shoes during COVID-19. They're squishy and the length is just a tiny bit smaller than expected. The width however is considerably small, we had to cut the sides even! Do not recommend to those with wide feet or those who are prone to swelling.",4,1,17
Sandals are even more poorly constructed than you imagine. The band started pulling away from the sole within a week and has had to be glued back multiple times. Garbage.,1,0,17
"They sent me the wrong color which was just annoying but my husband didn’t care, so it is what it is, but the smell these have is horrible. I don’t know why they smell so bad out of the box. I wiped them down with fabric softener and they’re ok for now",5,1,17
"Never wore anything more comfortable than this pair of sandals. I don’t know what the rubber has, but it’s very soft (more than “normal” rubber) and well cushioned. Was having trouble with knee and after using these sandals, the pain has been reduced to almost none.",5,1,17
"I wasn’t sure about these as they aren’t adjustable and didn’t immediately feel as comfy as my other slides. I was wrong. After using them for a camping trip they held up, worked great in the communal shower 😬.",5,1,17
Got this for my husband and so glad I sized up on these. My husband normally wears a size 10 1/2 and I got him size 11 in these and they fit him perfectly. Any size smaller would not have fit him. He says their comfy! I can’t really say how the durability is since this is only day one having them. They look just like how the pic looks and got here super fast.,5,1,17
"These slides fit wierd. There is a bump on inner sole that pushes foot into top of slide. Left slide is noticably smaller than right slide. Narrow and odd fitting, not like other Adidas slides...maybe a knockoff.",1,0,17
"Liked the look and style but the opening was too narrow for me personally; they fit but were tighter then I’d prefer. Opted for the same brand, different color but with the adjustable Velcro strap and those fit perfectly without needing to adjust the strap.",2,0,17
"Bought these for a beach trip, ended up loving them and now I wear them all the time. They are comfy and what I really like is that they are so easy to clean. Cleaned them up after our trip and they looked brand new again. I’ll be rockin these for awhile and already order a black pair as well.",5,1,17
"My 2nd pair. It was too tight when I first wear it. After I wear it for couple weeks, it did become loose, So that’s good. I love it because it’s simple style and clean look, but I feel like it’s a bit over-priced.",4,1,17
"Initially, I had ordered my size as a 13. This was already one size up, but this was WAY too small. Luckily, customer service was great and I was able to swap for a 15! I wish there were half sizes because these are slightly too large, but better than before.

These shoes do make your feet hot due to the material, but they are extremely comfortable especially as a flat footed person. Plus the design is sleek.

"Nose si son originales o no, vienen en caja que pareciera original, pero bro; si esto es original adidas ha perdido mas calidad que las hamburguesas de tu local favorito.",2,0,17
"First I ordered black men’s size 11. I wear 11 in every adidas shoe I own. They were way too small, I could barely fit my foot in. The next pair I received was black and white, which is not even on the product listing page. I want a full refund.",3,0,17
These slides seem to run very small. I ordered a size 12 and they don't fit the person they were intended for. I was able to give them to someone who wears a size 10 men's.,3,0,17
Don’t buy these. I bought these for my son in law to just wear around the house nothing drastic. First: they didn’t fit they were to small and I got the correct size. Second: he made do and they lasted 3 days before they came apart. Not satisfied,2,0,17
Buy these!!! I'm a mechanic and work on my feet all day and when I come home and put these on! They are so comfortable and the ball of my feet feel supported,5,1,17
"For 15 years I have been wearing the Adidas Adissage slides, and I should’ve stopped 15 years ago. These are so much more comfortable and supportive. Plus they are way cheaper!",5,1,17
My husband finds these to be really comfortable but wishes I’d gotten him the adjustable ones as he has narrow feet so he feels they are a bit loose on him.,5,1,17
"My main Adidas slides from previous had a thicker base, and fit better. My feet are a little snug for these newer ones, but with the adjustable velcro they are still pretty close.",4,1,17
I use them for my everyday use at home and walking around my home. I have been using these for the past 6 months and they are so comfortable. Very good product and at a great price.,5,1,17
They are true to size and nice looking. Very stiff non flexible shoe. Band across top of shoe cuts into toes. I have skinny feet and they are very narrow.,2,0,17
"Just got them today, put them on, and they fit exactly as they should (size 12). The soles of them mold perfectly to my feet. SO much more comfortable than the ones I've been wearing for, well, let's just say a long time. Very happy with them!!",5,1,17
"I rarely buy shoes online and this is a perfect example of why.
1) I wear a size 9.5 and ordered a 10 and they are still too small should have ordered an 11.
2) I did not realize they would be hard plastic.
3) I do not feel comfortable returning shoes because I wore them for several hours hoping they would break-in but they only got more uncomfortable as time went on.
4) Total waste of money for me.

Some people may like the feeling but not me",2,0,17
"These slip-on's have a surprising amount of cushion for the heel, which I always need. This is my first pair, but won't be the last! Plus, every where I go, when I am wearing these out and about, people have stopped me to say, Hey I have a pair of those too, Aren't they comfy?",5,1,17
These deserve a zero star. These are made for women. A man's foot cannot fit in these shoes without being extremely painful. My husband said these are the worst shoes he's ever had. Worse quality than Walmart and it's shameful that they have the Adidas name on them.,1,0,17
"I had a couple of sandals that where intended to use them in water environment but most of them had this ""Sponge"" that absorbs water and then they had this really bad smell. Was a little bit nervous to continue using this type of sandals instead of ""just rubber"" sandals like the crocs but this Adidas are made for use in a water environment. I'm amazed! Would buy again!",5,1,17
"If you are buying for a growing boy, then size up! My son is 14 years old and a size 12. They just fit with no wiggle room so they’ll probably work for a short time. These look like great shoes but I cannot speak to their durability because they were just purchased.",4,1,17
I ordered my normal shoe size and they would barely go on my foot. Ordered 2 sizes up and they are still snug. Sizing is very off.,1,0,17
"I ordered these shoes in a men’s size 8. That’s what the tag says, but the shoes are at least two sizes smaller than my roomy old Addidas size 8s and the quality is far lower. If the shoes stretch a bit, I’ll be able to wear them, but I wouldn’t buy them again.",2,0,17
Awesome Price and great purchase- sent to our condo when on vacation and they were perfect for beach to pool. Comfty fit and easy to wash!,5,1,17
"I bought a size 11 because that is the only size that was left. I needed a 10 for my son and thought for sure I would have to return them after he tried them on. Turns out they fit perfectly, so these definitely run small but it worked out for me.",4,1,17
"I normally wear a size 11, so that’s what I ordered. Probably should have ordered a size 12. They fit a little small. Don’t want to go thru the hassle of returning them so I’m keeping them hoping they’ll stretch out.",4,1,17
This item runs large. Not of best quality.,3,0,17
"Great product. First bought them for my husband ~5 years ago, had to buy him another pair recently, because he wars them indoors year around. This purchase was for our son, who wanted his own pair.",5,1,17
"I purchased for my boyfriend - He loves them and I will say, they are super comfortable and easy to walk in! Thank you! I added a picture to help others with sizing matters (I am a female size 8.5) and so you can get an idea and my boyfriend is a size 10.5 to 11 and they fit him perfect!",5,1,17
Fit prefect men size 5.5 for woman comfort . 😁,5,1,17
"Seemed oddly set up, as if your toes should be tiny. The built up areas meant to provide support are in completely incorrect regions, based on my actual feet and my simple basic understanding of human anatomy. Overall i am slightly disappointed. Feet are scrunched forward in the footbed in an uncomfortable position to fit the contoured design. Adidas failed on this simple footwear.",3,0,17
Not very comfortable. I feel like the top part is too small and there's no adjustment it is what it is so my foot occasionally slips out. It's not comfortable but does what I need it to do I guess.,2,0,17
Not comfortable. The strap is not adjustable nor is it flexible and the edge over the toe is a little sharp. The padding doesn't hold a candle to regular slides. 2 stars for style but I will never wear these. :/,2,0,17
I wear a size 10-1/2 or 11. I bought size 12 to make sure they would not be too small. I had to exchange them for size 13. The 13s are still too small.,3,0,17
Adidas has always been a trusted brand. Bought these for my son's birthday. He wears them often. They hold up well. Great value for the price!,5,1,17
"This is the second time I order these slides. The first time was amazing; great fit, durability, and size. The second time: the one with the stripes runs small. I will return them.",5,1,17
"This is the second pair , first pair I returned size 11 was not stretching too tight without socks, an worst with thin socks never bought Adidas shower type slides .Love the color Red.",4,1,17
"As others have said, the toe box is a bit snug. For me it just felt too tight despite going a half size up. They also feel pretty cheap like styrofoam. But they look nice and do the job.",3,0,17

"I've been using these for a couple of weeks now, both outside and inside, and I'm still happy with my purchase. I bought them at a men's 10 and my usual shoe size is a women's 9.5 . I like them a little bigger so I can wear them with socks as well (for practicality, not as a fashion statement). Would definitely recommend.",5,1,17
"Adidas slides are the best fitting, my bf and I wear them around the house or outside doing errands…they are perfect for any outfit and who doesn’t want to wear slides all day and still look good?",5,1,17
they way too small .I got them for myself and km a size 5 in men which is what I order but they're more for a child then an adult,1,0,17
"I had some other adidas brand slides (the ones with the weird nubs on the feet) and they were great, lasted years. I just didn't really care for the nubs on them. These slides are terribly uncomfortable. It's already ""worn in"" with an indentation of a foot that doesn't match mine. My $5 slides are way more comfortable than these.",2,0,17
" Son unas sandalias muy bonitas, cómodas, duraderas, de una marca reconocida y de calidad. Las recomiendo para uso diario, para estar en la casa o caminar porqueson de un buen material resistencente.",5,1,17
"Horrible shoes, even for shower slides. Cheaply made and are not the advertised sizes. I'd guess they run 2-3 sizes smaller than labeled. I discovered this after ordering 3 pairs in an attempt to get the correct size. Will be returning all 3 pairs.",1,0,17
These run small. They might as well be youth shoes,1,0,17
"My husband does not like it , he said the slippers too hard , make his feet not comfortable, and a little too big than usual size !",2,0,17
If you wear size 10 purchase size 13. Looks good and is comfortable.,5,1,17
"Very disappointing. Inaccurate description of slide. Cheap feel.

Normally I’m a size 10.5 in shoes, I ordered an eleven, it fit like a nine. I double checked the tag and it says 11. This makes NO sense! Where is the quality control?",2,0,17
"I'm a fan of the adidas brand, and definitely is not the first pair I owned. They kept up their standards and I'm satisfied!",5,1,17
"I thought these slides would be more comfortable, perhaps a little softer. It's my first pair of slides, though, so perhaps they are all like this. They do the job -- easy slip on shoes for a quick step out of the house, and easy slip-off when back inside.",3,0,17
I purchased these for my son to replace the pair he grew out of. They arrived on time and are just as we expected. They seem comfortable and sturdy.,5,1,17
"They definitely run small and really narrow. Not comfortable at all. I ordered them for my husband and they're even snug on me. Keeping them, as we tried them on with bare feet and that's gross to return lol",1,0,17
"this is for men and runs extremely small. we ordered this for my husband and instead of returning it i will wear it myself. so definetely a man would need to order size or sizes up to be able to wear this.
update: very uncomfortable. horrible.",1,0,17
A lot of people are saying these run small but I got the size I normally get for adidas and they fit perfectly. it took a couple days for the strap to stretch to the shape of my foot but they're so comfortable now,5,1,17
No even a month and falls apart I bought it here just to avoid to go to the store but got my lesson the ones at the store last a year.,3,0,17
"These won’t fit in a million years, will be regifting to my dad who has much slimmer feet.
I was a little disappointed in the quality as well, I don’t feel that these will last very long but I guess only time will tell!",3,0,17
Not worth it super hard to get your feet in I am a size 9 and could not even slide my foot into the size 12 because the top part is glued too close to the shoe. Also it's glued on so it'll fall apart,1,0,17
"Love the look when I saw them in an ad. They are cheaply made and certain they would not last. All the other size 9 i wear, this one was as close as you can get with my heel right at the very back. They run small. Returning them.",2,0,17
"My son really likes these slides. He is a swimmer and out grew his last pair. These are a little different, but he likes them just as much.",5,1,17
"Not true to size. Bought them and they were too small. And I even got them a full size bigger.
Update: I just got the second pair in and they are still too small and these are two sizes up. I don't understand why they are so small",1,0,17
"All my footwear is size 12. I ordered a 13 incase they ran small by mail order.
The size 13 pair recieved is too tight, I can't slide my feet into them.",2,0,17
I buy my boys these year round. Great for running out the garbage or to the pool/beach. They are hard on shoes and they have yet to destroy a pair of these before growing out of them. As a mom of 5 boys I’d say these are my favorite slides hands down!!,5,1,17
"I love these, they are easy to slip on and I keep them right by the door. They fit well and are durable. I would buy them again.",5,1,17
Not comfortable felt cheap. I left them in the sun for 3 hours and they warped under their own weight. They are either fake or Adidas really cut back on quality,1,0,17
I’m a size 11 and that’s what I ordered and they were to small also they feel to plasticy if that makes since very uncomfortable,1,0,17
"So, I have purchased very similar Addidas slides just like these in the past. I have always bought a size 12, so I know exactly how they fit and feel. This pair is smaller than all the others I have purchased in the past. There is very little cushion and the shape of the arch support is awkward and not in the correct spot. I am so disappointed because I thought this was a no brainer, but clearly they have redesigned and made this much less comfortable and much less true to size.",2,0,17
"Excellent quality, my son love it! I ordered a small size and didn’t fit to him, however the support was excellent and I bought another size and fit really good. The price is awesome you cannot find it. 100% recommended very trusted seller.",5,1,17
"I bought these for my husband who has thick, wide feet. Unfortunately, they do not accommodate his foot thickness combined with the width. They are well made, but if you have wider, thicker feet, you may need to go up a size or 2.",5,1,17
I wear these around the dorm and when I shower. I've had them for maybe just under a month now and the band becoming unstuck from the sole. Them being comfortable is completely pointless if they've fallen apart and can't be worn.,1,0,17
They were perfect for my Grandson,5,1,17
The most uncomfortable shoe I've ever used. These are definitely not made for flat-footed people they have the highest Arch I have ever seen in my life insanely High,1,0,17
Awesome. The fit is exact and they're so lite. They also don't slap your feet when you walk. I was also able to drive in them just fine; the feeling of the gas and brake on the sole is similar when wearing boots. They feel like $30 slides.,5,1,17
"my only quibble is that with water, I would have preferred a rougher surface, not a smoother one. Of course a smoother surface is easier to clean and dry.",5,1,17
"Got these for my grandson. They hold up, stay on his feet, and are comfortable. He has outgrown several pairs. We’ve washed them & given them to younger friends.",5,1,17
There’s something that seem not original about this adidas slide. Very different from the original adidas slide I was trying to replace .,3,0,17
"I had to buy another pair when my last pair were hijacked by my husband and kid. I love these. So much support, so comfy. Forever my favorites.",5,1,17
These are comfortable. Not to stiff and have a good curve for arch support. I hope i don't have issues with glue keeping the loop on the sandals like some of the reviews but so far they are holding up amazingly well especially when considering the price of these and the price of those similar slides that competitors offer.,5,1,17
Every other pair of size 13 shoes fit without issue. These slides are way too narrow and fit too tight. My feet keep sliding out of them because they’re made too small,2,0,17
These things are meant to last. I bought it for my dad and it’s only been 2 months and he almost slipped twice as they just skid and don’t provide protection. Now I have to spend money and buy another pair.,1,0,17
"Sad I bought these for father's day and they are a female size 8..It says mens 11 but they are not!!!....Ordered again!! A man's size 11 is actually a size (""13"")...
I would have given you 5 stars but your sizing is wrong!",3,0,17
I use them as house shoes but no complaints. Really comfortable even when wearing for awhile and after a long shift.,5,1,17
Bought a size 6 for my daughter and they are way too small the sizes are no correct. They are a men’s 6 which should be a woman’s 8 and they are way too small,3,0,17
"Favorite slides I've owned. Not huge on support but that wasn't what I was specifically looking for. Ended up buying a second pair for my spouse, who tried mine on and really liked them.",5,1,17
Runs small. I've had 2 other styles of Adidas shower slides and this is the first that runs small. Also not as comfortable as the other 2 versions by a long shot.,3,0,17
"Saw what I thought was the same shoe in a local store, but theirs was so much softer, more flexible, and much more comfortable. These were returned.",2,0,17
My 11-year-old son who wears a men’s 7 could barely get his foot in there they’re too narrow and too short it almost makes me feel like they are knock off. I’d spend a little more money and get some thing better quality.,1,0,17
"Probably the most uncomfortable flip-flops I've worn so far. There's a weird bump which I think is supposed to be for arch support, but it actually puts a lot of pressure on the nerves. Do not recommend buying these.",1,0,17
"These slides are great for showering in a health club/gym locker room. They are light, non-porous and dry off quickly. They feel very comfortable to wear and have surprisingly good arch support. Great and inexpensive solution for locker room and camping shower shoes. Top marks.",5,1,17
They are great for a quick walk or walking on the beach but overall not good for long use. They offer little support and aren't as comfy and they look.,4,1,17
"You get what you paid for I guess! I’m normally a size 10. These slides were too tight so I sized up. Still wayyy too tight. Judging by these other reviews, the band probably won’t last very long.",2,0,17
Size was a tad smaller than my last pair.,5,1,17
"Not bad. Does make feet smell if you wear it for a long period of time, recommend wearing socks if you're gonna wear it and aboid prolonged skin to rubber contact.",4,1,17
"Seem to be decent quality but probably won't last 6 months, not super comfortable or uncomfortable. All and all, worth the little bit they cost",4,1,17
"You don't really look for both comfort and style in simple shower slides - after all, you're not going to wear them to a social function, right? Apparently, Adidas didn't get the memo. My son was very pleasantly surprised and is giving kudos to Adidas - and Mom! Thanks Adidas!",5,1,17
"Comfortable, durable, water resistant, convenient...love my Adidas slides. Cant get 5 stars because they arent really a shoe..so support isnt really the same..but for a flip flop they are supportive lol",5,1,17
"Recently bought my husband a third pair. He loves this shoe. After wearing them all day, he just rinses them and they are like new.",5,1,17
The molded shape is great for a narrow or slightly more narrow/ medium width foot. My older son measures a medium width but he’s on the fuller wide and he is stretching these things out. Also the length is shorter than any other size 10 I’ve bought to date. Color and weight are good. The look is nice.,4,1,17
My second pair. They're lasting about a year but I live in Florida so that is alot of use. These are comfortable and true to size which is why I bought another pair.,5,1,17
Used it for dorm showering. Works great. Not slippery. Recommend.,5,1,17
"Yeah so they don't slide off easily which is good, and they're fairly comfortable, but I feel like they run a little bit smaller than advertised.",4,1,17
"Bought these for a relative because they kept taking mine lol. Needless to say these have solved the problem. Also wanted to say that Amazon is really surprisingly great when it comes to sizing, so even if you get it wrong they'll exchange for no extra cost.",5,1,17
"I don't what in the pressure points are in the flops, but after the second wear, I immediately took them off. There's a tingling, sting-like feeling I feel right away, when I've had them on. I have other slip-on's and don't have that problem AT ALL. It actually feels like someone is poking my feet with thorns in those flops. I was excited to finally get a pair of their flops, just to be disappointed.",1,0,17
"The slide part of the sandal that keeps your feet on the sole is uncomfortable. The fit is not too tight, but after walking a mile in my new sandals there were cuts on the top of my feet. I can't recommend these as I haven't had this problem before with any slide sandal.",2,0,17
My family has had several pairs of Adidas slides over the years. All of a sudden they seem to run narrow and they never form to you feet.,2,0,17
Great quality! My 9 year old wears them every day as he refuses tennishoes. He loves them and they hold up well! We've had for several months now,5,1,17
Although I like these they seem definitely different from my original ones. The old ones were definitely slightly more comfortable.,4,1,17
I ordered a size 13 and they are no where near the right size not a good value since I can't wear them I suggest you order these really big if you can,1,0,17
I bought this for my 8 year old son as he is growing fast and it actually fits him right the size 7.,5,1,17
The fit is great even for me with wide feet and they’re perfect for walking around the house during the summer. Love the colors as well.,5,1,17
Bought this for my husband and it looks good. Physical appearance is good but he told me it’s not comfortable to wear. There is something in the side of the slippers that is hurting his feet.,3,0,17
I thought these were the soft slides but they are NOT. the plastic is hard. I'm returning and buying the right ones. if you are looking for the super soft bottoms you should buy the adilette slides instead not the shower slides.,3,0,17
This version has weird stitching along top front toe edge which is really uncomfortable almost unwearable. They old rubber version was better.,2,0,17
These shoes worked well for my husband who has foot problems and can not walk barefoot. Used in the shower and around the house.,5,1,17
"Me and my Wife both got a pair and are extremely happy with our purchase. For the price you can not go wrong. Only thing I would advise of is that it took a few days for the sandals to feel comfortable since I it had to stretch a little to fit my foot correctly, but after a 2-3 days of wear in, they are perfect.",5,1,17
These are great to wear around the house and outdoors as well. They are comfortable and able to get wet with no worries. And stylish!,5,1,17
My husband at first did not want me to buy these for him because he doesn’t like to “advertise” brands for free but once I found these with the logo on the side he said he’d take a chance. He liked it so much I got him a second pair. He will use the older one for outside!,5,1,17
Wear these all around the house and when I’m outside doing work. They are comfortable and breathable. Very easy to clean too.,5,1,17
these are great shower shoes plus they look dope af. get lots of compliments and now i feel very cool. highly recommend,5,1,17
I love adidas because they give are big support and run narrow. Been buying these slides for years.,5,1,17
"I'm flat footed - wore these for about 10 minutes and had to take them off before I crippled myself. As I said my feet are flat, have always been flat and will always be flat. the padded instep was much too painful for me.
Yes, the looked good, yes they were well made ... but I don't have an arch so wearing them was going to cripple me.",3,0,17
Ordered for my son but way too small. He was very disappointed. He wears a size 10 and these were not wide enough for him to slide his foot in,1,0,17
"I wear normal men’s size 10.5 I purchased an 11 for a little extra room. My foot wouldn’t even go through the slide, it’s like their possibly woman’s? But say men’s.. my toes wouldn’t even come through the other end!? Their way too narrow! I don’t require wide shoes ever! Don’t purchase.",1,0,17
Loved these slides just too small normally wear 13 but sent back and ordered different ones cause they didnt have a 14,5,1,17
Quality product however they fit quite small. I wear a 9 and 1/2 but had to purchase size 11. They also are very narrow so if you feel that you have larger than normal feet from the size that you wear thenthese are not for you.,3,0,17
"These seem like fake Adidas which I wouldn’t expect from Amazon. Very disappointed, it’s so obvious they’re not real because the quality especially the sole is horrible! Beware!",1,0,17
"I am satisfied and the best thing is with that price you cant go wrong. Good quality. Good for a shower, sea, pool in or out of water.",5,1,17
"Just a little bit pricy but totally worth the price. Everything else I am satisfy with. I wish there is a cheaper alternative to the slipper. But oh well, I probably will wear this for the next couple years.",3,0,17
I love the slides but they do come tight compared to regular shoe size so I suggest ordering a size larger.,4,1,17
Look great and seem durable but have massive bump for the foot arch making really uncomfortable to use. Wouldnt recommend. Worse part is i have 2 pairs and unable to use.,3,0,17
If you have high arches you may want to look at something with an adjustable strap. I found these to be pretty uncomfortable.,2,0,17
The band holding your foot in the sandal is flimsy. It doesn't feel comfortable or stable and you have to jam your foot in. I wouldn't recommend this product for use.,2,0,17
"My husband didn’t like them very well, tight fit and less support than his last Adidas that were a different style.",4,1,17
"It's my second time buying this, the first pair I bought a year ago doesn't break but I just want another pair for mild outdoor activities. This time they seem to make the slipper a little bit tougher and thicker. I don't know if this is a pro or con but will find it out.",5,1,17
"For under $20 these are great. Bought for my son and he's happy so I'm happy.
Comfortable indoor/outdoor slides that look cool.",5,1,17
"Basic sporty slides for the kids, cheaper than at the big box sporting goods stores. Not worth paying a lot when their feet grow so fast. Would size up if in between sizes.",5,1,17
"The top part of the slide is in extremely uncomfortable, it had a hard plastic feel and the edges hurt my feet. I wouldn’t wear this even if Adidas pays me a salary every month.",1,0,17
"They are cool looking, but fit a little tight. I have several pair of these and the others fit nice and loose...",4,1,17
My son swims year round. These are perfect for him when on deck ready to swim. He loves them and walks around the neighborhood with them on too. So much so I may need to order a new pair soon.,5,1,17
There is a hump in the middle that isn't my favorite. They fit nicely and hold up. What can I say? It works well.,4,1,17
I purchased these as a Christmas gift and my husband loves them. It seems like he never takes them off. He says they are so comfortable he wears them every where.,5,1,17
"The strap is made of a foam material that starts to stink if not dried completely before being stowed away in a bag. I had to throw mine out after only a few wears because the smell became unbearable when I put them in a bag overnight while they were still a little damp. However, they were comfortable.",3,0,17
"They are the same size as a size six. Although it shows it's a size 7 🤦.
My Son grew out of the size six. He was excited when the package arrived, but the new ones are actually a size six. Ugh 🤦",5,1,17
I got a size 10 for my man n they fit as expected perfectly I would definitely get the same size u wear as it is spot on n he really loves them nice n comfortable thank u,5,1,17
I received the wrong item. Instead of the item being the open slip on as shown on the picture. I received the thong flip flops. I am not able to provide a review for the item shown on image.,1,0,17
Bought these and they fita as expected. Have good support and are very comfortable. Made well should last a while.,5,1,17
Bought these for my husband - the footbed is so hard. It's like walking on a rock. Returning.,1,0,17
"I bought these to use getting from my pool to outdoor shower, walking on hard surfaces and gravel pathways. They are so uncomfortable that I tried them once and quit. Also were sized a bit large. A flaw in the design of the fit of the toe area. The arch was OK.",1,0,17
These are a bit more stiff than the regular Adilette. This is what makes them waterproof. They are good but different than the supersoft standard.,3,0,17
"While these are cute, they are snug. I am a US size 11 in women (9 in men) and the 9 is a little too snug. The shipping is super fast.",3,0,17
this would have been a five star review because I love how comfortable they are and I think they look super cool but unfortunately they began to tear where the top attachment meets the front part of the sole of the sandal after a week and a half of very light wear inside the house only. I probably only wore them 4-5 times total before noticing the tear. Bummer bc I thought I was going to love them. Will be returning them.,2,0,17
Processing and shipping was quick and easy. Slides came as described by seller and in the pictures provided by the seller.,5,1,17
"Way small. Returned this within 2 days. Also rubs the top of my feet.

I’m
A big fan of adidas gear. This was way too small and very uncomfortable unfortunately",3,0,17
They're extremely lightweight. I bought then to wear around the house instead of going barefoot (since I have plantar fasciitis). I like the support to my arches and the heel well. Can't complain based on the price I paid and the fact that it does what I needed it to do.,5,1,17
"Is not the most comfortable fit, but it does it’s job. They are great to wear at the pool.",5,1,17
I love these slippers they are very comfortable and last forever!!! The best for the price I just got them in another color. I’ve been buying these for years Adidis are best!!! Also they came in a day ahead of schedule. Excellent company to order from.,5,1,17
"Length is the right size for a 13, but they seem to be a bit wide, especially for an Adidas ""shoe"". If the top ""strap"" was a bit tighter they would be great.",4,1,17
Greats sandles but order a couple sizes bigger. I wear a size 9.5 in Most my sneakers and I ordered a size 11 in these Sandles and it fits perfect.,4,1,17
This is way too small. I’ve been wearing the same size Adidas sandals for years and these I can’t even get my foot into it.,2,0,17
"These are somewhat comfortable slippers and they fit fine but they feel very Low Quality and I don’t think they will last in the long run. They feel really light but flimsy, like they’re made of inferior quality materials. You can even see the exposed glue keeping the things together. Kind of overpriced if you ask me.",3,0,17
The box was all dented up so I wasn't expecting to like them as much as I did. I am a US size 8.5 - 9 Womens if it helps✌,5,1,17
It was a reasonable price. I personally am not a fan of the center having the bump (which is met to shape the foot). These aren’t cushioned as much as I prefer but they aren’t beyond hard to the point I hate them. I’ll still use them.,4,1,17
The shoes are well made and very light. I don’t know if it’s because it’s a “men’s” shoe or if they are just made large and wide but I would order 2 sizes down from your true shoe size if you’re a woman. I usually never write reviews but I’m trying to start bc it does help to see what other people say about the product. Reviews have saved my butt many times.,3,0,17
"I have pretty good posture, but after putting these slides on, they would not fit straight and went crooked and the comfort was really lacking.",3,0,17
"Run a tad small. My teen has chubby little block feet size 7. Bought 8, a bit snug on him but length is fine. Hoping as he wears them they’ll stretch a little.",4,1,17
"The wife wears a women's size nine and these fit her perfectly. I ordered men's size ten. Unacceptably, comically small.",1,0,17
"Super comfortable and fit great. The material is really comfortable and durable, I wear them almost everyday and I’ll wash them once in a while and they still look as new.",5,1,17
Hard to find these fit shoes for my husband was very satisfied with these fit to task size and comfortable for him. He was very pleased.,5,1,17
"I purchased US size 13 (printed on the slides themselves, in Amazon description, and on the shoebox). They are 3/4'' shorter than my old slides, and are too small. It's a clear labeling mismatch.",1,0,17
They were a little on the small side. Also they kinda hurt my toes. Maybe with a bigger size they would feel better.,4,1,17
"I'm pleased with this purchase. Good value for the money. Only time will tell how durable this product truly is. Fits a bit narrower than expected, though I'm a little wider than most and still comfortable.",4,1,17
"These sandals must have been irregulars since the left shoe fits considerably tighter across the top band. The hassle of returning something for $20 is not worth it. On another note, I did like the pair I recently received in navy.. which is why I ordered the scarlet color.",2,0,17
"I never had a pair of slides that have a portion in the middle that seems to be there for extra arch support. As soon as I slide my feet into them, I could feel how comfortable they were.",5,1,17
"Great product, very confortable. Run true to size. Made in India. Down side: stitches under the strap scratch top of foot and large toe.",4,1,17
"Shoes are great for teen with feet 2 or 3 sizes smaller than the adult these were purchased for. Great quality, just way too small.",4,1,17
