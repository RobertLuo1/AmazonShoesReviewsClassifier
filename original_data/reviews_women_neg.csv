I bought these thinking they were new since it's full price. I got them today and they came in a damaged box and the shoes are obviously used with grass and dirt on the bottoms and stains all over the shoes. The soles are worn down from use over time. What a joke! I'm so angry about this! Do not buy from these people.,1,0,26
I have been wearing Air Zoom Peg 36 for many years. After trying the 37 I found the style has changed and the shoe is now made higher fitting and rubs on ankle bone because of this. I returned these shoes.,2,0,26
"The cost of these shoes have nearly doubled in recent years. And yet quality has diminished. Terribly chincy, paper thing tongue that rubs uncomfortably. So disappointed.",2,0,26
"They are way uncomfortable to wear all day or for running or walking. for a Nike shoe, I am very surprised at low quality! Ss",1,0,26

"EXPECTED FIT IS GOOD. STRICTLY FOR RUNNING.
TRIED TO USE THEM FOR SHORT DISTANCE WALKING. FEELS UNSTEADY… TRIED TO RETURN THEM. BUT, TOO LATE! MIGHT TRY TO SELL THEM
ON AMAZON!",3,0,26
A substandard product was sent with zero finish. Seemed as if a rejected piece that was sold at full price and sent across to me . HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED with Amazon for not doing quality checks before sending products . HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED with Nike for letting sub standard products be sold in the market - not caring enough for their brand image,1,0,26
"I was really looking forward to a new pair of shoes for work and when I first tried these on they felt fine. Well, I work 12 hour shifts on my feet and these rubbed the back of my heels and tops of my feet so bad they were raw when I got home! I wont wear them again.",2,0,26
"I couldn’t wait for them to come and after the first try to the store and back I couldn’t stand it.
They are very high in the back and it gave me very ugly blisters. I don’t know if I can send them back after I used them one time. The back does not have a lot of cushion and being very high that creates a very uncomfortable fit . I am so sorry .... I cannot even walk ; running will be impossible.",1,0,26
These run SMALL.,3,0,26
I generally wear an 8 in shoes and an 8.5 in athletic sneakers/runners. I got these in an 8.5 and they fit quite well - EXCEPT - wow is there something wrong with the way the backs of these shoes curve. Right into your achilles tendon with exceptional force. I saw other people mention this in their review but I didn't think I'd have a problem with it because I always wear socks with a very cushioned heel tab. You can see the black stripe on my sock heel in my photos- it's right where this hits my achilles tendon. And it does not help. At all. These were so painful. Even just standing - not even moving - they dig in and hurt. I only lasted a minute or two wearing these around my house before I packed them up for a speedy return. I'd only recommend these if you don't have achilles tendons.,2,0,26
"I know my bad review is strange since these are my second pair. I’ll explain…. I bought my first pair at Kohl’s and I was stuck with them because I wore them outside sooo I went through very uncomfortable long walks & workouts with horrible blisters on both heels (caused by the high heel design and rough material) until eventually they became bearable while I continued looking for a new pair. (clearly I haven’t been successful). I’ve had them for 1 1/2 years and they finally fit to the point I’m not uncomfortable but the cushioned footbed is flat & worn & I have a hole in the front left shoe so I need a new pair. I would normally never walk around with a hole in my shoe but I’m having a hard time finding a new pair. I finally decided to order these, I wasn’t excited to get the same exact shoe but thought I’d go up 1/2 size , that would definitely help and deal with it. I’m not convinced I will keep them. I feel even though I went up a 1/2 size I’m still going to get blisters. At this point I need to go into a store and try them on which I’ve done several times 🤫 After reading a lot of reviews (after I received) it seems it’s a design flaw for the blister issues! Also, I remember when I bought my first pair I thought they were super comfortable, that was NOT the case once I went out on a 2 hour walk😭 I know everyone has different feet these might work for some people but not for me. I don’t want to get stuck with another pair.",3,0,26
"These are going to fit my two left feet so well. NOT. Received two shoes, one is a size 8, the other is a size 9. Both are for the two left feet that I didn’t know I had which are apparently two different sizes. Cute shoe but can’t comment on anything else but looks. Also, my right foot feels slighted. Return.",1,0,26
"They are super cute. I went for a power walk, right away I felt my Achilles being dug into. I figured it may loosen up. I ordered 8.5, sizing is accurate. I tried different socks to avoid the friction and my Achilles being dug into. The part that touches Achilles is hard and sharp. If I can’t walk in them I sure can NOT run in them. Maybe it’s just the white pair and how they are designed. Sadly, I will have to return them.",2,0,26
"These shoes were uncomfortable the minute I put them on. Hard soles, not bouncy. Usually, with a new pair of shoes, as soon as you put them on they feel great. The part that sticks up above the heel is stiff and cuts in to my lower back leg. The top of the tongue material felt uncomfortable as well, as though there is a seam there. I have nothing good to say about these sneakers.",1,0,26
"This is the first time I have ever considered that I may have gotten a fake item on Amazon. I own these exact shoes in a size 8 that i purchased from Finish Line, i only had them a few months and they got quite dirty so i ordered the same pair from Amazon and i cant even get my foot into the size 8. The shoe is also very hard and stiff, Ive never experienced something like this before.",1,0,26
"Runs small. Nikes are the only running shoes I wear because of their arch support. Unlike their other shoes, however, these have no arch support. They are very padded, but still require an arch insole. Also, most of their shoes have a notch out of the heel to make a crescent shape and allow room to move. These have a heel that makes an arch high up on the heel and makes blisters in less than 20 minutes of wearing. Poor design and will make me think carefully before purchasing this brand in the future.",2,0,26
"I walk a lot and buy quite a few walking/running shoes. I recently purchased a couple of Nikes and found them to be the perfect design for my feet. Unfortunately, this design in the same size as the others were to short. I had to return them.",3,0,26
"Love the style and colors; fresh for summer but after just one wear within the first hour, felt pressure on the back of my ankle. When I got home, had a blister on the back of my ankle. Not worth the pain. Needs heel cushion.",3,0,26
"These shoes run very small. I ordered a half size larger than I usually wear due to other people saying they run small, and they still did not fit well, still very tight.
The shoe is really a nice looking shoe, but I just couldn't deal with how tight they fit and had to return them.",3,0,26
"I loved these shoes when I first got them, but now they started making a clicking noise when I walk and it’s very disappointing!! I purchased these because I had another pair just different color that just wore out. Other than the noises when I walk they are just like my others.",2,0,26
"I liked the style, the cushion, and the comfort of the shoe. However, after walking on them for a few minutes, my feet began to feel like they were being pushed/slid forward, hitting against the front, which made my toes sore. I am returning these shoes.",2,0,26
"I rarely write reviews but I had to for these. These shoes look great and at first feel great. However, after two weeks of running in them, I started developing shin splints. I've had them and have ran in them for two months now and have to consistently deal with shin splints. The one year old shoes I had before these never gave me any shin splints.

For context, I run around 11 miles per week.",1,0,26
Horrible experience buying running shoes online. I wore them once for a 3 mile walk/run and they tore my feet apart. So disappointed with the brand because I expected better than that for the price I paid. Will never buy walking/running shoes online again. My feet hurt as if they've been put through a grinder.,1,0,26
"Even though I bought a half size larger, the shoe keeps hurting my ankle due to the design or a flaw.",1,0,26
I will be returning. Sadly!! I got the normal size I buy with Nike and they were a size to small. So bummed cuz I’m nit buying again. I feel that something isn’t right!! I have a lot a of Nike sneakers never have I had to go a full size larger. 8 1/2 normal size but def need a 9 1/2 if I were to buy again.,3,0,26

Reviews warned to order ONE FULL SIZE BIGGER. You need to do this. Also expected more comfort for the high cost. Very sub par shoe.,3,0,26
"Wow. I’ve never had this problem with Nike’s before. Put them on for the first time to walk my dogs. Super comfortable until I actually started walking. They rubbed horrible blisters into the back of my heels in 20 mins. I usually don’t get blisters and I understand that shoes should be worn in before taking them on significant treks, but this is crazy. How is one supposed to break them in when you can’t walk in them for more than 10 mins? Pick another pair.",2,0,26

"Not true to size. Too harsh on the back of the heal. Shoe is very stiff, close to no flexibility for the balls of your feet. Overall a painful experience.",1,0,26
I always order Nike in the same size & never have a problem. With this style I should have ordered atleast a half a size up. These are very tight across the top of my foot. The most uncomfortable pair of Nikes I own. That being said the bottom are very cushiony so I like them in that respect.,3,0,26

"I purchased identical shoe directly from nike store last year, I figured buying from Amazon I would get same product but it's at least a size and a half smaller than my authentic nike from the store. I checked size on label in both sets of shoes and both are 9.5 so I have to assume the pair from Amazon are not real Nikes.
Trying to return them is not easy because I have no way to make labels for returning😣",1,0,26
"They are comfortable other than they are very high and very stiff at the Achilles tendon area at the back of the shoe. The arch support is good but the shoes are painful after a while. I'm working 12-hour shifts and needed moleskin to cover open blisters after 4 hours and I bled into the shoes, even with higher socks. Perhaps these are designed as more of a fashion shoe, probably comfortable to run errands but not good for working on your feet.",3,0,26
"This beautiful sneaker was a gift, so I was REALLY upset that they were too small. I've worn Nikes size 9 for years, so why do these fit so poorly? Even worse, I wore them outside, so no exchange...",1,0,26
"I love Nike shoes, but these ones missed the mark. The back (as stated in many reviews) of the shoes are very stiff. I got blisters the first several times I wore them, hoping to break them in. It only semi worked, but are still so uncomfortable on my heels, that I don’t even try to wear them anymore. I regret buying them, which is sad to say. Also: if you are still going to gamble this purchase, size up...they run about a half a size small.",2,0,26
"This product is definately not original , so uncomfortable and the fit is pathetic . It hurts my ankle . Nike is my fav brand and by seeing and wearing it can say this is not original .",1,0,26
Went 1/2 size bigger than usual. Could have gone 2 sizes bigger.,1,0,26
Okay so these shoes are comfortable but I would suggest upping one size for comfort. I have wore this for 3 days now and I got blisters kn the second day. It does not seem to get any more comfortable than what it was the first day. I will probably be exchanging it for a bigger size.,3,0,26

"Well… the shoes took more then a week to arrive. Came in a nike shoe box well packed. But as u can see on the pictures, I don’t think it’s suppose to have the bare foam exposed like this in a original nike shoes! Makes no sense to me. To be honest, u can’t notice the bare foam on the seller’s pictures page. So, I am not sure if this is original! I don’t think so. But I will paint the foam black and I guess it will be ok. But be aware that the shoes will come like in the pictures.",2,0,26
The tongue of the shoes have exposed foam on the top and look unfinished. I am not pleased with this at all. Would like to send these back and get the correct ones. Paying 150.00 for these shoes should entitle me a pair of shoes that are finished.,1,0,26
Front flaps are different sizes,1,0,26
Several things about the shoe show that the shoe is a used shoe although nothing is worn out you can easily tell this “new” shoe at the “new” price is not so.,1,0,26
These are the fakest Nike I have ever seen. The quality is so cheap. The sole is made from the cheapest plastic. I was so disappointed. Don't waste your money. These aren't real Nikes. They are Hella fake.,1,0,26

"The box came torn and held together with a rubber band. The shoes themselves have clearly been tried on (debris in the tread and the laces were untied). Also there is a very noticeable dark spot on the top of the left shoe. The Nike “swoosh” looks like it has been re-glued to the sides of the shoe and overall, the appearance is poor. I was really looking forward to getting these shoes but can’t say I’m very happy now.",2,0,26
"Received this product and first thing I noticed is I received the shoes in a plastic bag with no tags or nothing. When I touched the material and instantly knew these were knock offs right away. I own plenty of Nike shoes and these definitely were not real. The material is very cheap and thin. The stitching is extremely weak, not reinforced well and finally the foam on the bottom was cheaply made. I ordered $20 shoes off of amazon once and it felt like the same exact material. Not a Nike shoe for sure. Might as well buy the real deal for the same price they are selling these poorly made shoes. I was disappointed in the quality, not worth the money.",1,0,26
"I ordered a 7.5 and it fit really tight, which is unusual because I have narrow feet. I also sustained an injury from the shoe digging into my heel after a 30 minute walk. The soles also did not feel that comfortable after a long walk. After a week of wear, they did loosen up a little. Still not the most comfortable sneaker. I have never had this issue with Nike sneakers before. I will stick to buying my Nikes in-person. I don't recommend these.",1,0,26
"I've had gym shoes that I have to work in before, but these are not work in-able. I have had these for a few months now, and, every single time I wear these, they rub my ankles until they bleed. I have tried every trick in the book, from getting in-shoe supports, to wearing blister pads on the back of the shoes, but everything I do causes the rubbing to get worse. If it weren't for the rubbing, the shoes would be supportive and comfortable, with the rounded soles making walking very easy and cushioned.",1,0,26
"I’m a huge fan of Nike running shoes, but these are not my favorite. I bought these specifically for running (I run ~15miles/wk). They run slightly small compared to my other Nikes, so I’d recommend going up a half size.

After running in them now for about a month, they don’t provide as much support as I’d like, and my ankles/arches are hurting midway through my runs, which I’ve never had a problem with before. I tried running in another pair of Nikes the other day and no pain. So, overall, they look great and maybe good for the gym or walking, but I wouldn’t recommend them for frequent runners.",3,0,26
I had these in all black and was pleased with them (they crease easy) so I ordered the navy blue ones. The first time I wore them they were fine. Yesterday mid workout I started to experience numbness in my left foot. It’s as if the left shoe shrunk overnight! I have zero room in my toe box but only on the left side. My other pair are perfectly fine. Wore the navy ones again and tried to be more conscious of how the shoe fits and the left shoe is significantly smaller.,2,0,26
Not for wide feet. Also make your feet look long,3,0,26
"I have flat feet and these have absolutely no support. I own other nikes that are all knit fabric that have support in the arch area. Nike is usually pretty good about that. I’ve recently started playing double dutch for fun and exercise. Websites have been pointing to this show as being great for jumping. I can’t say if they are or are not good for jumping. But if it can’t support my arch at the try on stage, then unfortunately they must go back for me.",1,0,26
"Love the shoe! BUT these are for running in the gym, not outdoors! I live in a rural area and run in the street. By doing so I collect pebbles on the sole of my shoes. Make it difficult to run long distances and to also I bring in the pebbles into my home if I do not remove the at the door.",3,0,26
This is a nice workout shoe. The reason I rated it 3 stars is because of the uncomfortable ankle flap on the back of the shoe. I don't understand why it was designed the way it was. It runs painfully on the Achilles tendon when I walk. I don't feel the flap during high intensity workouts and short jogs. I wish it was not there so I could wear the shoe for walking also.,3,0,26
"Nice shoe, but the sizing info is way off. I’m a woman, and the title says MEN’S shoe and I bought this in my male size. I just received today and the sizing is in women’s. Returning this just to wait till Tuesday to get my right size. So frustrating.",2,0,26
"Again, when I tried the shoes on, they were too tight and hard to squeeze into, to be my size. Nike's makes it's shoe sizes too small, for the expence. They don't tell you that you should buy your size one half to one size up.",2,0,26
The shoes are too small. The insoles are removable. With them in they are about a size too small and too tight. With them out the shoe fits but has no comfort and feel flat. I will be returning.,1,0,26

"There is little lateral support for training and the shoe runs very large compared to it's previous models. I have very narrow feet, so I always bought Nike's b/c they fit great.

"If you are wondering whether or not to order these shoes from this seller....don’t do it. The shoes I received are NOT authentic Nike. I knew as soon as I saw them that they looked a little weird. Then I when went to put them on they were large and clunky. This is odd when Nike is known to run a half size small and especially odd when I’ve worn the same exact for more than 20 years. The inner sole was hard as a rock, not soft and cushiony the way a nice new pair of Nike feels, the outer sole was made of the cheapest plastic that made a click-clack noice when I walked not the nice quality rubber Nike uses, and every step I took made a crunching sound which I was never able to tell exactly where it came from. As I examined more closely there were so many errors in the stitching where places did not align the way an authentic Nike would have. There were many differences in the shoe pictured and the shoe I received. I did not think to read the feedback/comments before I purchased as Nike is a reputable company and I’ve never had an issue with fake shoes but as my suspicions kept growing I went back to read others experience and many others also caught on to the imposter shoes so this has been going on for quite a while. If you want a shoe that won’t last as long as a pair of Nikes and that are loud and uncomfortable to wear then buy these ones! If you are wanting an authentic pair you will be taking your chances if you purchase from this seller.",1,0,26
"I only buy Nike shoes and these are not the same quality. I have had them less than 2 months and I take very good care of my shoes but it already has a little hole in the top, I'm guessing from my toenail even though I keep my toenails short. My last pair of Nike shoes bought from Amazon lasted 3 years and the ones previous to those lasted more than 2 years. These lasted less than 2 months. Now I have to spend more money to buy a new pair.",1,0,26
I only wear these shoes 2 x per week to go for a walk. Ordered them in February of this year and they already have a hole in the toe area. Very disappointing!,1,0,26
When I first put these those on I hated them. I still prefer the Nike revolution 5 but as I wore these shoes over a few hours somehow my foot got used to them (I know that sounds ridiculous) and they broke in. I still don’t think they are nikes most comfortable or supportive shoe...by a long shot. The foot bed is really hard. I purchased these because the reviews were great and I love the colors but they ended up being just ok. They seem very basic with no added padding. I’ll probably keep them because they were on sale and just wear them running errands. They look really cute with jeans. For walking I definitely prefer the revolution 5.,3,0,26
"Look cheap, I think they are knock-off.",1,0,26
"I have lived other Nike runners and talky liked this color, graphite with black soles but the inserts don't remove to allow my heel wedge to fit in one shoe and there is no arch support or cushion felt at all. The toe box is too big for my liking, so I will have to return.",3,0,26
"I'm on my feet at work all day and needed comfortable sneakers. These worked well but after about a month, I got a hole on the right foot (where my big toe is). I didn't do anything drastic or kick anything with my right foot.
I've used them on long walks/hikes but they're not very supportive compared to a new pair I got (which is another brand as well).
I also notice a difference with the way my body feels with my new pair compared to these sneakers.
I wouldn't buy them again.",3,0,26
"I love Nike shoes. I also loved these shoes until last week. I've had them for just under two months and I already have a hole in both the right and left shoes. I do a lot of walking and these shoes were pitched as good for walking and running and transitioning from running to walking and vice versa. They have great grip and I was really happy with the purchase until they started to break down last week. I'm so disappointed and honestly, more disappointed that I spent $80 on what I thought was an excellent pair of shoes that would last me way longer than 2 months.",2,0,26
"It is too small although I order the size I usually wear. I read the review about the size before I placed the order, some say it is true to the size, some says it is not. I pick to trust the one who say true to the size and it is wrong. The shoes is too small and narrow although I have narrow feet. And when I try to put it on, I do not feel the arch inside the shoes as other people describe. So, I decided to return it. However, I need to pay the shipping fee around $10 dollars and ship it with USPS. I am not happy with my purchase.",2,0,26

"I just wore out a pair of Nike Downshifters , and was pleased to find that I could order another pair. But unfortunately the Nike swoosh on the side is made of a thick rubber-type paint with a thicker border. It rubs on the side of my foot and is very uncomfortable. So, I will be returning them.",3,0,26
"Light, comfy and nice looking. But not enough support of the arch. It fit well my narrow feet. But it’s NOT a pair for running.

I've written Adidas for 30 yrs, and have always worn the same size. Nike shoes run really narrow and are not comfortable for me to wear.",3,0,26
Returned these shoes. Didn't appear to really be Nike shoes. The left shoe was cut so low around my ankle that the shoe would slip off my ankle when I tried to walk. It was so bad I had no choice but to return them.,1,0,26
I've bought Nikes for years but the last two pairs really hurt my feet. I've always been a size 9 and this pair my toe rubbed through after two months. The quality seemed off and they are 3 months old and I have to throw them out. I switched to new balance and a pair of Brooks now,2,0,26

Don't buy these!",1,0,26
I never have any issues with nike shoes for wearing so many years but this pair gimme cheap fabric feeling and way too tight in the middle makes me feel like this is a fake nike!but even worse I end up have to pay $10.75 postage for return!!! will surely not go back to this “trusted footwear “ company again for business!!!,1,0,26

I love the style and the color, so waiting for a size 9 to arrive.",3,0,26

"These shoes look so awesome! In reference to how they look, great! I received multiple compliments. Comfortable when putting on! My nephew tried them on and said ""Wow, they're so comfortable and squishy."" lol. Unfortunately, they were not good for working out(cardio and weight lifting) . They are quite a bit heavier than I expected. And after wearing them at the gym for awhile, they really hurt my feet. It felt like the top of my foot was injured lol. Probably best for just wearing out to the store or out to dinner or out to a movie. Not great if you're planning on being active on your feet for a long period of time. Or, maybe they just don't work for my high arched feet! I really wanted to love these! I had fully planned on ordering several colors...but they just hurt my feet lol. I guess you could give em a try for yourself, since they are not too expensive!",2,0,26
"I like that the shoes came on time, and they look amazing, but they do not fit, I even ordered a size bigger and they are so tight across the top of my foot, it's very hard to get my feet inside the shoes, but once I finally get the shoes on they just feel so uncomfortable, I normally wear a size 9 in women's, but I ordered a 9.5, and also I have wide flat feet so maybe that played a role in it. I'm going to send them back,",1,0,26
"I'm not sure if this is one of the Amazon products with fake reviews. Shoes were delayed in shipping waited approx 2 weeks. Arrived in with very little packaging shoes did not have the typical stuffing etc inside that you usually find with new shoes, shoe box was beat up and looked like these shoes may have been returned once already. Shoes ran very small were difficult to put on and take off. padding on inner shoe did not cover the entire shoe there were two separate raised padding one oval shaped just under the toe area was hard and uncomfortable, placement was off the other was in the heel area. The added cushion may have been nice except it wasn't a cushion and did not move with the weight of my foot so it was simply two hard raised area on the inside of the shoe. Overall the shoe was stiff and very hard, definitely NOT for any type of workout or even long walk, there is ZERO support in this shoe. I can't imagine wearing for anything other than a photoshoot. They are very cute and the color is exactly what I wanted, but overall the shoe is simply cheaply made lots of visual design, but no actual functional design. I am in the process of returning this shoe. Would not recommend. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!",2,0,26
"Size: fits as expected.

Style: I'm not terribly fussy, but all of the giant writing on the sneakers, which looks a bit ridiculous online, looks absolutely absurd in real life. And the sneakers make my feet look a bit huge... All that said, I have problems with my feet (plantar fasciitis and being on them consistently, so my feet are hardly ever not sore in some way) so I don't give a much of hoot about style if the shoes are comfortable and the price is right.

Comfort:
~~ Soles: The soles of these sneakers are really quite solid; given their open and airy design. I was hoping they'd have a bit more give and spring and impact absorption to them. They do not have any spring, and very little give. They're also a bit noisy until broken in. They aren't uncomfortable; they just not aren't anything like as cloud-like to walk on as one might suppose.
~~ Insoles: The insole left sneaker is perfect and perfectly comfortable. The right sneaker has an abnormality in the molded structure of the floor of the sneaker that puts pressure on one side of my right heel that is very uncomfortable, and given enough time would cause a blister. If I pull the removable insole out, I might be able to sand or carve down that spot inside the sneaker, but nobody should ever have this problem with any kind of shoe. If the right sneaker were like the left sneaker, these would be perfect.
~~ Sneaker body: Light weight, breathable, comfortable. No nasty sweaty hot feet problem here.",2,0,26
"I purchased the shoes for my 11-year old daughter. The shoes were so narrow she was unable to slide her feet in them.

"I don't know where all these people are walking that are giving 5 star reviews! I work in a warehouse, with concrete with 3 levels and I walk all night, up and down stairs. By the end of my 10 hour shift, I felt like I had been walking on rocks. My feet hurt so bad. I had high hopes for them cause of the reviews but not one review ever stated they worked in a warehouse with concrete. Well this is that review, for anyone else who does. Take your chance, I did and I wasn't impressed.",1,0,26
"They are really cute. Not gonna lie. They do have support inside which feels right when I slip them on. But when I stand up, they are stiff as hell. And when I walk on them, they are louuuuuud, clunky, and don't have much flexibility to them AT ALL so it feels like I'm walking flat-footed. If I were to bend them in a video, they would seem flexible to you, sure, because they are not made of steel. But I'm telling you, when I walk, they do not move with my foot naturally like a good shoe should. There is nothing lightweight or comfortable about them. They also hurt the top of my foot after a bit and the back of my heel as well. Not from rubbing, but from the stiffness. I can wear narrow-footed or normal shoes. I have normal arches. I wear size 8.5 to 9 so I got size 9. They fit fine. I like thicker socks anyway. I wore them in my house all day. I'm gonna try to break them in at home. I will NOT wear them in public and be stuck with sore feet. If they don't soften up, I'm gonna change my 2 stars to 1. The only thing I like about them is their visual attractiveness.

Update: I have been wearing them around the house every day for about a week or so. They do not feel any more comfortable than they did on Day 1. I can probably get away with wearing them to the store for grocery shopping but definitely not to work. Sucks. They really are cute.",2,0,26
"I’m not a professional athlete, I’ve owned my share of running shoes & these aren’t it. They have a nice sporty look, fits well as far as functionality no. Maybe for walks around the block or at the park .",2,0,26
"I'm not one to bash products on Amazon, but you need to be warned. Buy these if you like rock hard plastic platform clogs which are nearly impossible to put on. The shoe size was correct for me but the mouth of the shoe (that's the best way to word it) is so small that I could barely put my foot through it. They don't have a traditional tongue and laces; it's a single piece, so there's not a lot of adjustment room. The soles aren't flexible and there's no cushion inside the shoe with the exception of a few small air-bubble-like pseudo-pads which compress to nothing as soon as you put a little bit of weight on them. These are really cheap shoes and they look cooler online than in person. They weren't damaged or made of tissue paper, so I didn't give them a one star rating. I guess it's possible for people to like them if they aren't too picky.",2,0,26
"Likes: color as expected. Okay design. I normally wear 8.5 USA, I ordered size 9 and fits perfectly with a little room left for my toes to breathe and wiggle. Definitely ordered a size up.

Dislikes: the band in the back could be a little bit smaller and not so much pointed out because I had to attempt to sow it in a way to appear less pointed out. slobs of dried up glue everywhere!! Yuck. Loose threads. I do not recommend this. Advertisement had no issues yet my shoes came with all these issues. I need a refund please. I am unhappy. I didn't spend my money to receive this. Unacceptable.",1,0,26
Everyone was raving about these shoes and how comfortable they were so I purchased a pair. I am on my feet all day 12+ hours. These shoes were comfortable for the first 5 hours and after that my feet hurt more than ever. If you plan to be on your feet for expended periods of time I would not recommend these shoes. They are very stretchy and i felt the comfort that way but the comfort on the bottom of your feet after a long day is not great.,3,0,26
"I loved the way these shoes look. After reading the reviews, I thought they would be good to work out in. I wasn't planning on doing a marathon (even with the glowing reviews).

My first time wearing them was a few days after (I have a black pair that I had been wearing but they were showing wear on the soles-I had but not worn for a year. FIRST CLUE).
Long story, short. Decide what you want these shoes for.
If you want them for looks GREAT! AND you can't beat the price (I've gotten compliments-they didn't know my feet were killing me)
If you want them for anything more than that; DON'T BUY THESE SHOES!!! Look at the photos, I average 7 miles a day walking, on the road so you decide if you want to do a more forgiving surface. But even with that, you have less than 300 miles in less that a month and this (view photos again) this is the wear you have? I did not include the photos of the blisters-that would be too much.
LOVE the look (I still have a blue pair that I haven't worn) but hate everything else. I HAVE TO BUY MORE EXPENSIVE SHOES NOW!!! Hope this helps.",2,0,26
Cute in color but that’s it...cut too small to even get on and did not look comfortable. Will be returning,1,0,26
"I like nearly everything about the sneaker, especially the support since my arches are starting to fall. However, there a few things I don’t like about this product: 1. I don’t like that the shoe doesn’t open up for an easier slip on and 2. The bottom of the sneaker is not slip resistant.",3,0,26
"First I love, LOVE these Shoes! They are so comfortable, it’s like walking on clouds! They fit was a little snug so I would buy a half size, or full size up.

Update!! Three months in and there is a tear in the sole of my shoe. I literally wore these shoes everywhere and expected so much more as far as the quality of the shoe.",2,0,26
"I really loved how these looked and the sole felt comfortable and supportive, but the sizing chart is not accurate. I ordered a US size 9 based on the chart on their listing, which shows to be 10"" but the size on the box shows it's a bit smaller than that. All of their shoes show US sizes. I would've reordered a different size because I really like the shoe, but they have the size 40 as a US 9, 9.5, and 10 and a 41 as a 10.5. The 10.5 on the size chart on the listing is half an inch bigger than the 41 on the box. I wish the sizing was listed correctly, but unfortunately had to return them and can't confidently reorder since they only have a 9.5 and 10.5 as their next two sizes but no accurate sizing online.",3,0,26
"I received the product, it doesn't run true to size. I'm a size 7 in sneackers and it's too short in the toe box. I've requested 3 times to return and receive a refund. They keep wanted to size it up and send me another pair. I don't want to have to deal with this again. Extremely disapppointed with the seller. It's been 2 months I have yet to get this resolved.",1,0,26
They are full of cushion inside but the pull strap on the back of the shoe detached the very first try on. Cheaply made. But I get quite a few compliments on how cute they are.,1,0,26
"I’m disappointed, I’ve had several nurse friends recommend these to me and decided to purchase. I originally bought an 8 and they were too small so I returned them, you don’t carry half sizes so I had to purchase a size 9 instead and they’re too big. My feet slide around in them but I’m not going to return again. Please consider this in the future. Other than that they are comfortable and stylish, worth the money for the quality.",3,0,26
These run small,1,0,26
"I could feel the tread with every step. There is minimal memory foam at the ball of the foot and it’s placed oddly therefore offers little support. If the entire insole was made of memory foam, I may not have felt the tread with each step. Super cute and well made but not at all comfortable.",1,0,26
The shoes are nice but the tip is showing glue like it will separate soon. Returning because for the money it should be a better quality. On the bright side it does feel great on the feet it is very light weight and does provide support. Will order another one to see if this was just a fluke.,3,0,26
"Decent shoe but has its cons. Love the color choices for sure. Non-slip is not accurate however. Walked into work with such little wetness on my shoes I never hesitated to be cautious and my first step onto the finished floor I slipped and barely caught myself. Wasn't expecting that at all, since in over 2 years I have never slipped at work before. The right shoe has a squeak when I walk which gets annoying quick since I walk about 10 miles a day at work. Have received more complaints on them than any other shoe I've ever owned tho. Will probably try another color eventually.",3,0,26
"How can a score be so noisy?! Every step with me left foot, every single step.
At first I was in love with these but I finally wore them for a whole day today with a LOT of walking and I might end up throwing them away because I don’t want to hear that sound every time I step.",2,0,26
"I got these because I’m a nurse and on my feet all day mind you I’m a size 9 I’m 5’9 also.
I now have a bruised toe and dunno why but every since wearing these I’ve gotten one.
If you buy them get insoles especially if you have high arches.
They are very bright and stand out.
If you have super thick ankles do not buy them!
Not great for walking all day.
They have plenty of support just hurt more in the toe area.",3,0,26
I was under the impression that the item was true to size. I wear a size 5 but ordered a 5.5 and still couldn't get my feet into the shoe... I'm like what... however I tried to to a return but now the option has ran out and I'm stuck with a pair of shoes I can't fit. Tried contacting the seller and they were extremely rude and uninterested in what I have to say😒,1,0,26
"Honestly, I absolutely loved these shoes. I have only worn them 4 times, only to work and they are already starting to come apart. They were poorly put together but look and feel nice. I was going to buy another pair but now I am not so sure since I haven’t even worn these much and they are already coming apart.",3,0,26
"like most things from china, there are many inconsistencies with sizing and colors. be wary before you purchase. i am assuming these variations come from lack of standards in whatever factory they are made in.",3,0,26
"I walk a little over 2 miles a day and although these are super cute, they are kind of heavy and provide no cushioning whatsoever. The bottom of my foot was actually numb by the time I was done walking and I now have two new blisters. The sizing was perfect, though.",2,0,26
The shoes are fine and the purple color looks nice….BUT the strap on the back end of the shoes is awkward (WHAT’s the point of the strap?) and it can easily cause serious accidents. TOO bad…had to return.,2,0,26
The main reason is that the shoe is a bit hard so I feel going up in size may be best and you can add a foot insert to make these shoes great. They are fun and I do want to give another chance by ordering up size the next time around. Toes fit up to tip which is fine for walking but hurts when exercising. Will add to this when I get another pair in a size bigger.,3,0,26
"I just got these today (9/27/21) and these literally feel like you are walking barefoot on the concrete (if that’s what you are looking for, then buy these). I will update in a week to see if these feel any better to me. So far with all of these great reviews, I am not impressed with these and they feel cheap.",3,0,26
I worked 12hours standing on my feet and these shoes didn't provide support or comfort. Maybe the first 4 hours but after that i was wishing I had on some other shoes.,2,0,26
Size is misleading. Poor quality.,1,0,26
"These shoes are SO narrow I couldn't even get the tops of my toes into them. I sent them back the next day, they were so pretty and looked great I really wanted them to be as promised :( They refunded my purchase right away. This is one of the downfalls of buying clothing online I suppose, but to not even get the top of my foot into the shoe was ridiculous. I had my 13 year old who has much more narrow feet try them and shes couldn't get the shoes past her arch. I hated to send them back they looked perfect.",1,0,26
"I really like these shoes. They're super cute, built well, all of the things except they sent me the wrong size twice..

I ordered a size 9/42 euro. I received a size 8/40 euro. This is the second time I ordered this exact product in a size 9 and received the size smaller. What the hell???",2,0,26
"These sneakers are cute for sure, but are not comfortable. They felt rigid, almost like a spin shoe would. While width of the shoe was not a problem for me, they definitely felt smaller than a size 8. I am normally a 7.5, and my toe literally hit the front of the shoe and curved under. So I ended up returning.",2,0,26
"I think these shoes are super cute, but I ordered the red color (because I've been needing a red sneaker forever) and they sent me TEAL BLUE. Lol! Although the blue is super pretty, I'm a little disappointed. Might decide to keep the blue and just order a new red pair, but nervous I'll get the wrong color again!",3,0,26
"I could barely get the second shoe over the heel of my foot. I got one shoe on but it was very tight. I started to cut the tongue of the shoe because they are really nice and I work in a warehouse so I need them but they just didn’t fit. Maybe i could try a bigger size, I’m not sure",1,0,26
"Read reviews that said order a size up because they run small.... this is not true, these shoes are true to size I usually wear a 10, my size wasn’t available and listening to reviews I ordered a 10.5( they are big on me) they are light weight, but not comfortable for all day wear they also have a clicking noise... I get compliments and will keep the shoe ... but I wish I ordered my original size",3,0,26
"The tongue is sewn down making it difficult to slide your feet in. There is a loop and handle on the back of the shoe and both are needed, even after I cut the shoes to loosen the tongue. These are cute and comfortable but made for elf feet.",2,0,26
"The padding in the shoe, feels weird, and after just 1 week, its already wearing out and after just wearing them for 1 hour today, it feels like Im walking on cement with bare feet. Will never buy this brand again",1,0,26
So I believe I paid about $40 for these and they aren’t bad. Support isn’t very high and they have a slight bit of weight to them but not much. They are comfortable but not for long long periods of time,3,0,26
The opening for the shoe does not accommodate wide feet with high arches. If the opening were larger I may have been able to get my foot in it to see if they were comfortable. Processing return.,1,0,26
"They look like a cheap knockoff! Hardly worth almost $50 bucks! I will say this, the return option is so easy and fast that, if you're curious, I would say just try them out...you've got nothing to lose!",1,0,26
I did not like the big strap in the back. It’s way bigger than it looks. I ordered my regular size but they were way too big - and the color was way too bold. Was happy to return them,1,0,26
"I purchased these shoes in hopes for something comfortable and to help alleviate pain in my feet. They are awesome in design and looks but actually made my feet hurt worse while wearing them at work all day. Now everyone is different so your experience may have been better than mine, but I would not recommend.",1,0,26
The eyelets for the shoe string break easily. The shoes make a weird sound when walking. The support isn't that good. They are lightweight and they hug the foot,2,0,26
"Could not even put them on. Ordered a 9.5, normally wear 8.5 or 9. My foot didn’t even fit in opening. Maybe I got a mislabeled pair, all the tags/labels indicated a 9.5 so there’s that!",1,0,26
The shoe is very comfortable and great looking. What I didn't like was I wore the shoe 2 times and the lettering on 1 shoe has lifted up and is hanging off . It got wet after wearing in a little bit of rain which did not last long. Looked down and letter coming off. The price was great but disappointed with the lettering.,1,0,26
"If you are looking for a casual, cute shoe that you will not wear for very long, this shoe is fine. I find them to be very heavy and hard on the bottom. I would not recommend for working out.",3,0,26
"These shoes are not for people with wide feet, it will be a real struggle. They were not at all what I expected and I was very disappointed.",1,0,26
"I was excited when these sneakers arrived because they’re so cute until then I tried them on. They were so narrow (my feet are quite narrow as it is). I wasn’t even able to get my entire foot in the shoe. So, my advice is to buy a larger size than you think you’ll need.",1,0,26
I would not recommend this shoe if you are looking for longevity. I’ve had the shoe for about 2 months and it has utterly fallen apart sadly. I wore this shoe leisurely and not for working out. I would be very grateful if the company would replace them!,2,0,26
"the light blue & neon green color is so cute in real life - but that is the only good thing about this shoe. the memory foam is not in the right spot, so i have chafing from around the ball of my foot. i did 30 minutes on the elliptical and my feet are killing me - my foot was sliding around since these are a half size too big, you cannot tighten the laces, they are VERY heavy & clunky, and they make so much noise on tile/hardwood floors. using these for quick errands only NOT for exercising at all!",1,0,26
The shoes are very cute but they are noisy. There is very little rubber on the bottom of the shoe and the rest is plastic. When you walk they squeak horribly.,3,0,26
I work in the medical field and I have to give the people I take care of baths. Anyways I was in the bathhouse getting everything ready excited to try these shoes and I was sliding all over the place and almost fell on my ass.,2,0,26
First I went through all of The reviews to make sure I was making a good purchase I bought the shoes for work since the reviews suggested they are comfortable but despite the reviews it’s all wrong these are the worst shoes to go to work with they are not comfortable and and it’s not wide and absolutely no type of support for the feet,1,0,26
"They're absolutely gorgeous, I got alot of compliments, but I must say, the rubber soles came apart after the 1st day, I didnt return it, too much of a hassle, I just crazy glued it together. They're pretty comfortable too.",3,0,26
"I am a true women’s 9 and these were ridiculously small, like I couldn’t even put my foot inside them small. They don’t seem very supportive either.",3,0,26
"Shoes are nice and comfortable. However after wearing them for 1 8 hour shift, the bottom sole felt funny and I realized it was coming a loose. I'm calling Amazon to see what I can do about it.",2,0,26
"These didn't work for my feet! I have heel spurs & plantar fasciitis in both feet, so my feet DID NOT like these at all. I brought these for strictly for work.",2,0,26
"The toe in the shoes do not fit properly, tried to contact seller numerous times but seller is non responsive. My recommendation is don’t buy these shoes because if you want to send back you can’t.",1,0,26
"I previously received this from my daughter in red as a bday gift and loved them. So, I decided to order another color. I ordered the fluorescent green to match a few outfits and they were snug. I also noticed a few flaws. The letters were fading off and there was very poor stitching on the shoes. I wasn’t happy at all about that. I returned them the same day I received them. I will be reordering in a different size. The color m matches perfectly...so I really need these lol.",2,0,26
"The shoes are nice on the outside, but the soles that are supposed to be for cushion came out, they are flimsy and was also given two right feet. The left shoe had a right sole cushion that was shoved in there in a very lazy manner and when I removed it saw a hole in the material on the bottom of the shoe…. Not great… the outside of the shoes look great but it doesn’t really help if I need support while I’m running…",2,0,26
"I ordered a 1/2 size large. I couldn't get my foot in the shoe. It was so still and didn't open up, Do not recommend,",1,0,26
"They are not light weight, medium weight more descriptive.
Sole of shoe super weird plus there is no give. The strap tag on back too long.
Very narrow and awkward to pull on.
True to color!",1,0,26
"These were smashed into the box and wouldn't go back to their normal shape. The toe was caved in on both shoes. Run small. Felt like I was walking on the concrete, no cushion",2,0,26
Bought these shoes because I thought they were we’re good for me for work definitely did not you’re so narrow I wore them one day to work and ended up pretty much while working in my sock feet of course I couldn’t return them because I got white because that’s what color shoes I wear and I drop something on the top of it so it made a little stain 😢,2,0,26
"They look okay, as pictured. Bought the shoe in my usual size; fits perfectly. My chief complaint, and it's a deal breaker for me (I really wanted to make these my new gym shoes) is that the sole doesn't feel very supportive. As soon as I put them on, I could feel the sole (it feels cheap and plastic as you wear it) bearing pressure on parts of the bottom of my foot. I couldn't imagine wearing these longer than 30 minutes without them bothering me.",2,0,26
"Thought these would be lightweight, but heavier than I thought. I guess because of the hard plastic on the bottom",3,0,26
"Shoes look super cute in the photo but a bit bulky when wearing. The extra strap in the back sticks way too far out, not even sure what it’s for. Inside almost feels like you’re stepping on crinkly paper under the fabric of the lining.",2,0,26
"Don't expect a good shoe ,only for looks. No support whatsoever they are light but they do not fit like they should they are very narrow by one size larger",1,0,26
ORDER UP SHOE IS NICE AS HELL BUT HAD TO RETURN I ORDERED A 9 IN WOMAN BUT IT FIT MORE LIKE A SIZE 6,2,0,26
"Not very comfortable, I work in the ER so I'm on my feet a lot, these hurt my feet so bad :( so after 2 days I stop wearing them.",2,0,26
"I can’t even get them on ,
Been so busy I haven’t been able to return them , they are so tight around the opening I have even get my foot in them",1,0,26
The top mouth does not stretch (not a deal breaker for some) but after a week of wearing these shoes they were so worn down and uncomfortable! I tried to wear them one more day and my feet cramped up for the rest of the night! Would not recommend,1,0,26
"I couldn’t try them on. Ordered a size larger than what I Wear. Normally am 8, these shoes were 9. You cannot adjust it in any way. Just a hole that doesn’t stretch to put your foot into.",1,0,26
"Shoe is comfortable BUT heel is much to narrow and hard to get shoe on, wouldn't recommend these",3,0,26
"When you are use to wearing new balance , this shoe is way to hard on your foot . No cushion at all . They are cute , have good arch support but the bottom of the shoe is way to hard .",3,0,26
"Way too heavy , not very comfortable.
Ok for walking but most definitely not a running shoe… a little disappointed",1,0,26
"I can't honestly give a rating on this shoe, simply because I can't wear the shoe Its too big. I ordered my normal size and was sent a totally different size. I understand sizing are in many countries.. but there are also charts.
Now the color of the shoe is the TRUTH, so are the markings. The size was all wrong.
Thank you",1,0,26
These shoes are very light weight and have great ventilation that your foot can breath. Dissatisfied with the bottom soul. Worn down the bottom souls with in a month of wearing them. I bought another pair and those wore down as well.,2,0,26
Love the neon yellow! I got allot of likes. BUT... the plastic weaving under the shoe started to break just a few months after I got these and now both shoes squeak with every step.. EVERYBODY heard me coming. It's very annoying. FYI.,2,0,26
The right shoe has a arch built in but it doesn't match the actual place where it should be causing the shoe to hurt and irritate my foot.,2,0,26
Ordered 1/2 size bigger and they were way to big. Wore them twice for long walks (with walking socks ) and they hurt my feet at the end of the walks. Gave them away.,2,0,26
I ordered the size I normally wear. The box said a size larger but these shoes run very small. I walked in them for a far amount of time but just did not have enough room. Cute but can wear them.,3,0,26
"They are little heavier than expected. They also
Run a bit large. I would order 1/2 size down. The loop on the back is very big.",3,0,26
The opening to the shoe is very small. It is sewn together so you can’t pull the tongue back and loosening the laces make no difference. I had to cut some slits to allow more space for my foot to go in. Once they are on they are fine. Good for walking but not enough support to be on your feet all day,3,0,26
"I bought this for my GF and she works long 12 hour shift as a CNA and her initial comment was it feels sofe and comfy but after wearing it to work for one day, she complained that her feet hurt worse than her last shoes. The need to make the inside softer.",3,0,26
"Runs big.
I usually wear 7 in my workout shoes 7 is kind of big. Sucks tejuela don’t have half sizes 🙃😒",3,0,26
I Order a half size bigger than normal and was hard to put on very narrow shoe..but comfortable when you finally get them on.,2,0,26

"I wear an 8.5 which wasn't available so I went with a 9. Unfortunately, the 9 was too small and had to return them. I actually let my mother, who wears a size 7.5 try them on and they fit her perfectly. So I'm not sure if the sneakers were packaged wrong. There was no size indicated on the sneakers themselves just the box.",1,0,26
I love the way the shoe looks and fits! My only complaint is that it is very hard on my feet. My suggestion is buying in soles to put inside!,3,0,26
"These shoes have got to be the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever worn to work. Working as a nurse comfortable shoes are important. By the end of only an 8 hour shift, my knees & calves were aching so bad. I have never had this happen before. The cushion in the inside of the shoes hit all the wrong places & no arch support. I was so excited for these shoes... such a bummer",1,0,26
"I bought two pairs.
Felt light, for two pairs of shoes to be in the box.
Returned back to Riteaide and he said no that’s all.

There was only ONE shoe (black) in the box????

The other pair of shoes didn’t come in a box, came in a plastic bag, but at least there’s two in there.",1,0,26
I’d heard great things but unfortunately these shoes were way too big and uncomfortable. I tried on a pair of the exact same shoe and size my coworker had they fit differently mine were so much larger. I’m not sure why mine would fit so different when it’s the same size 8 and brand. I cannot return because I wore them to work with COVID positive patients it wouldn’t be safe.,1,0,26
"These sneakers are very uncomfortable. They have zero arch support and strange air bubble pockets located underneath the ball of the foot. After wearing these for 2 hours three days ago, I still have pain in the balls of my feet and plantar fascia. Do not recommend.",1,0,26
I need my money back on my card now from this shoes thank u I need my money back now,1,0,26
The arch support is nice but the shoes needs more cushion to the heels and toe area of shoes,2,0,26

Comfy and light weight. However had a hard time trying to get them on. The tongue of the show it attached without much give. If u have a high instep forget about it.,3,0,26

"I bought 2 of the same exact pair, one teal and one black. the sizing was off with the black pair, to the point that I couldn’t get my foot in them. My suggestion is to try them on immediately and start the return if they don’t fit because now I’m stuck with a completely useless pair of shoes THAT SHOULD’VE FIT",1,0,26
I ordered 2 pair by mistake. They did not fit and would like to return. Cannot get a return slip. I did not realize they came from china.,1,0,26
It’s a hate and love relationship with these,3,0,26
I brought the shoes because I'm on my feet anywhere from 8-16 hours a day. At first they felt great but I noticed that after a week of wearing them at work I developed callouses on my feet. So if you buy from this particular seller maybe go a half size up.,2,0,26
I love the purple color but my right foot is a six larger than my left and it feels very awkward. I also have then in black. O think men shoes. Very comfortable. I think I messed up the size with these. They're to wide.,3,0,26
"The shoes arrived very very late, had to order twice to receive it because the first shipment was lost. The shoes fits too tight and felt like there’s no room to breathe. The back strap hangs loose in the air and I got one size bigger and still does not fit right and very uncomfortable",1,0,26
3 HOURS into my FIRST DAY wearing these shoes I feel something under my shoe like I had stepped on a sticky rolled paper and I look only to find the bottom soles of the shoes already coming off!!! I am highly disappointed and only gave a 1 star because I had no other choice. Should be ZERO stars!,1,0,26
"Nice shoes but not light weight, very heavy, thick souls. I got them because it said light weight",2,0,26

No quality control at all! The right shoe lace up was way off center while the left shoe looked fine. I have a relatively wide foot and these felt a little narrow for me. Definitely returned them as soon as I saw the off center laces.,1,0,26
There were bumps in the sole that I’m guessing are supposed to be for comfort or support. They gave me blisters all over my foot! Not just on the back of my foot which is common with a wrong size maybe. The blisters across my toes and ball of my foot were excruciating and lasted weeks.,1,0,26

Sneakers are pretty but the fabric is horrible. One scuff or drip of any liquid and it’s OVER! Almost feels like Felt? Highly offended by the quality. I’m questioning the authenticity of these sneakers. I wear Nike 90% of the time and I’ve never seen anything like this. I’m gonna rock them though. Probably won’t buy anymore sneakers from Amazon either.,3,0,26

After 3 days of hiking with these shoes the sides were peeling apart. Not sure if these are real or not but I know for sure the real nikes would not be doing this. Here are some pics for your own opinion. Don’t get me wrong they are very comfortable but the material quality is not good.,1,0,26

Coming from my older pair of 2016 Nikes, it was time for an upgrade! And what an upgrade I got. I had my heart set on this color scheme and was so happy to get it in my correct size. Will wear these constantly and update if it doesn’t hold up. But so far so good! Can’t beat a good pair of Nikes.",3,0,26

Like getting the same car model make and year, but a different color because you got in a wreck and wanted the same beloved, never broken down car and had to bring the new one to the shop within a week because it broke down. There is no way these shoes were really Nikes. The first time I wore them while taking a long walked, my left foot hurt and seemed slightly shorter than the other one, but I pegged it to that I need to loosen it up. The second time I wore them to the fair grounds on a hot day. I was screaming silently with pain and if I had to walk with my shoes on any farther on to the car in the back I was going to take my shoes off and walk on the burning gravel ground. The Nike shoes that I have been getting for decades are great, but these same sized and seemingly the correct and good colored Nikes were painful and did not fit or made properly which are now at the dump.

Wore these mostly walking or on light jogs - have never had a pair of shoes wind up in such a condition in such a short time, including previous pairs of Nikes. Kept wearing them while I tried to find another pair of sneakers and eventually a hole wore through on both outer soles completely to the inner sole and the back inner ankle on both shoes wore away to the outer fabric withing less than a year.

I bought my original pair from Nordstrom Rack and it lasted me a year of daily use and felt very comfortable. I suggest if you want this shoe, go to a trusted Nike retailer. Don't buy off Amazon!!! If you think you bought a fake pair, report the site and seller to Nike.",1,0,26
So I just received the shoes today and I tried them on and they seemed very thin maybe because they want them to be breathable I don’t know really. The reason why I have it three stars is because they are in my opinion expensive and did not fit like the reviews said they should I got a size five and that usually works for me and it was two small and now I have to return them because they were expensive and it’s just so annoying so for the hassle of having to wait for them now send them back I gave them a 3 star.,3,0,26

These shoes were expensive and fit horribly. I should have returned them but wanted so bad for them to work. Lesson learned.,1,0,26
Nike usually is pretty good and consistent but this missed the mark. they feel and preform like shoes from walmart. the material is flimsy and they offer virtually no support when working out or walking too long. I can see how much they have flattened in only two days of wear.,1,0,26
It really isn’t comfortable and when running with it my feet get tired very quickly. I have bought the Nike sock shoe before and I literally was devastated when I had to throw them away. It’s badly designed and not at all comfortable.,3,0,26
These shoes are slightly on the small size n only lasted a month already ripping,1,0,26

Shoes were to tight and changing for a different size is double the price. Not acceptable. Will not but Shoes from here again.,2,0,26
Didn’t even wear them a fully time. There is a heavy plastic part on the toe box that literally smashed my big toe. I didn’t even bother to try the second one on.,1,0,26

"Let me start out by saying these are some of the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. They are slightly more narrow than I feel like other Nike styles are. I tried on a size 9.5 wide at a store because it’s the only size they had, but I ordered a 9 medium based off of how the pair I tried on fit. If I were to buy them again I’d probably get a 9 wide. But I won’t buy them again. As comfortable as they are, they drive me absolutely crazy with the noise they make while walking on hard floors (which is like, most of my house). It’s hard to describe, but it sounds like the noise your shoes make when you step in something super sticky and then walk around... but really loud and it doesn’t matter where I’m at, it’s the same noise. I don’t even want to wear them to the gym because I don’t need people staring at me because of my noisy shoes during a class.",3,0,26
My feet always end up feeling achy when my day is done. I stand up alot. May not have enough support built in.,2,0,26
"What the what is with the weird plastic toe piece???? The rest of the shoe is awesome. I can't wear anything but softback sneakers due to bone spurs. But, the toe space! Gah. WTH Nike??? Does it get better with wear?? Advice?",2,0,26

"They look good and feel nice but definitely not for running. The white sole is just light foam and bends in offering no support at all for your ankle. I bought these wore them for a run and strained my ankle.. bit gutted because they're not the cheapest but yes

"These arrived in a box bottom with no lid wrapped in plastic which was sealed. They are supposed to be new and never worn so I questioned that first. Second I wear a 9 1/2 shoe in ladies and every single brand including Nike except this pair, they are huge. So I’m going to try to return or exchange for the nine and see if they fit. The toe area is very large. I do like the sole which looks like it would be good to grip on surfaces. The fabric is as expected. I’m just not sure about this at their current price point. They may be a refund. Update: it will cost me almost $6 to return them. I’ll be more careful how I order from now on.",1,0,26
"Shows did not look super brand new. There was an orange stain on back of shoe as pictured, a little scuffs, they did not look nice when I put them on. They are a very nice color, but I’m going to have to return them. I like shoes that are super brand new…they have not been worn but had scuffs. Maybe it’s because there was a note in the box that read “This item has been re-packaged in recyclable, frustration free packing because the original box was damaged in transit.”",2,0,26

"This shoes was supposed to be a gift (my 2nd order) after the 1st order didn't happen from other seller. I thought to order from another seller to make it right. To my surprise, for the 2nd time around, the shoes delivered is UK4.5 and I ordered UK5. I gave it to someone to try to fit maybe it's okay as this was supposed to be my belated gift. It's too tight, so I need to return and will just give cash as a gift. I gave up ordering as maybe for the 3rd time around, it can be a another failure. I will wait for the refund until the seller receives the item. Very inconvenient as I need to ask someone to post it for me as I am not allowed to go out due to this current pandemic. Otherwise, the item did arrive on time and it looks okay. It's worth £83, so I was really expecting a nice one. Anyhow, it is what it is. I've already ordered so many shoes from other sellers, but this is the 1st time I ordered as a gift and for two occasions, it failed. The surprises didn't happen.

"I bought these sneakers to be my summer running shoes. I have a solid pair of La Sportiva sneakers that I use for winter/trail running, but I was in need of lightweight pair for warmer months. Honestly, I was persuaded to purchase these by a mix of great price and great reviews. I was running about 20 miles/week at the time and feeling good. A month-and-a-half after switching to these sneakers, I was taken down with severe hip bursitis during a race and I was unable to run for two months! I spent the summer in PT and I'm still dealing with residual hip flexor pain, but at least I can run again. I did A LOT more research about sneakers and bought a pair of Saucony Ride ISO for hip support. I love my Sauconys and they weren't that much more expensive then these Nikes. If you are just in need of an inexpensive sneakers that look good to wear while you do weekend errands, these Nikes are probably fine. BUT I strongly suggest you do NOT buy these as actual running shoes. Your hips will thank you!",1,0,26
"They run a bit small for 9 W. There was no specific arch support. The shoe doesn't support the foot at all. They're cute, they were reasonably comfortable, but a sport shoe they were not. I returned them.",2,0,26
"I’m a 9.5 or 10 and I got the 9.5 in this shoe. Super cute!! My only complaint so far after working out 3 times is that I got the WORST blisters on the back of my feet. I had to take them off and walk the rest of the way home because it burned so bad. Now I have to figure out how to get the blood stains out of my new white shoes. I haven’t had this issue with other shoes but these seem to hit just above where my socks cover and they rub with every step on the back of my ankle. I did notice the “bulging” issue on the sides of the shoes as other reviewers mentioned, but so far this hasn’t been an issue with how they fit around the foot.",3,0,26
"I was disappointed to receive these shoes and find one of the insoles not properly adhered in the shoe. It was bent and didn't reach the top of the shoe. Had to unlace the whole shoe, peel the insole and reapply it. Then when I put the shoe on, the inner exterior side of the shoe was warped like it was a worn shoe. The shoe itself fits well. The insoles aren't that comfortable because they seem smaller than the shoe itself, but overall for the price, they will do.",2,0,26
"Not sure if this is a counterfeit brand or what, but the sizing was way off. I've always worn the same size in Nike shoes, and ended up having to return these because my usual size was WAY too big. I tried wearing them right after they were delivered and they pretty much fell off my feet. Didn't seem to be bad quality at all, just the sizing ruined it for me. If you're committed to buying these, I recommend going a half size or even a full size down from what you normally wear.",3,0,26
"The shoes fit great- I’m usually a size 8 and ordered an 8. However, the color was definitely not what I expected. I ordered Gun smoke/ocean bliss/dark gray, and was expecting the ocean bliss to be a nice blue color, like in the picture, but instead it’s a bright, fluorescent yellow-green color (see pic). Definitely not what I wanted and not my style, but I’ll have to end up keeping them because I’m too busy to return at this point, hence why I ordered shoes online.",3,0,26
"I walk 5 miles a day on pavement. I have worn out many pairs of Nike Flex shoes. I got the Revolution style the last time. From the first time I put them on, I had trouble with them. The curve in the back of the shoe is way too deep and cupped, and it's causing chronic pain in my left heel. I tried changing the way I lace them, adding heel inserts, etc. Nothing works. I usually get 400 miles out of a pair of Nikes. I'm getting rid of these before I hit that mile marker.",1,0,26
"Although these shoes are as cute as can be, they are lacking a little in the comfort department. Wearing them around as normal is fine. But as soon as I ran in them, it was like immediate shin splints. I was disappointed there wasn't more support in them since they have the word ""running"" in the title. However, for walking around, they are comfy enough, but my recommendation is to find something else for running.",3,0,26
"Bought these shoes for work having to stand 8 hours straight. I own many Nike shoes and these are the first ones I’ve ever purchased that have hurt my feet this badly. I can barely walk in the front door of my house without feeling my feet breaking g underneath me.
Definitely do not recommend these if you are standing all day on your feet.",2,0,26
"I have purchased several pairs of Nike Airs over the years because they are super cushy and comfortable and give me a lot of protection from impact and made me feel light and bouncy on my feet. These shoes aren't like that at all. They have no spring, feel like they are providing very little cushioning against impact and they aren't very comfortable either. It is worth it to invest more money for a higher quality running shoe.",2,0,26
"The shoes are so beautiful and I really wanted to keep them, but it really lacks arch supports. I wore them around the house for a few hours and they really hurt my arches. Also seems too light and cheaply made to be real Nike, but maybe that’s the trend companies are doing mow.",1,0,26

Well I forgot that Nike runs narrow. I wear a 9 so I ordered 9.5. The length is perfect. The width is not. I wore them to work one day and my feet were killing me by 10am. Tooo tight ! Will find someone with narrow feet to give them to.,1,0,26

The sole and uppers don’t match. Well after wearing them only 1 time... I can say OUCH. My arch of my Right foot is crying. I was limping by the end. I woke up this morning and my arch/sole still hurts. Sending these back. I’ll stick to my Mizuno’s.,2,0,26
"They were fly as hell love the design but...i Took them back after wearing them only twice. I cleaned and sanitized them and took them back to amazon returns at khols. I was so disappointed!AND MAD! They sent me size 6.5-7 when I selected a size 6. They were too big my feet would pop in and out of the shoes even after I wore thick socks and I added a second pair of support insoles on top of theirs to maybe keep my feet in the shoes. They were bottom heavy so I felt like I was wearing boots. Started wearing out real quick but hey what do ya expect from$40 shoes.They are breathable my feet did not smell comfy offers arch support thick padded insoles. I DONT RECOMMEND THESE TYPE OF SHOES FOR EVERYDAY WEAR,FOR RUNNING,WALKING AND WORKING OUT. MAYBE TO JUST LOOK GOOD IN WITH A NICE OUTFIT TO MATCH. My frustration comes from them sending me a size bigger then what I selected. So I asked for a refund and im just gonna buy Nike.",2,0,26
"The color is even nicer in person the shoe has an awesome stylish look and it was the shoe I wanted but it was not practical, the laces are a cheaper lace which I could tell immediately if need to replace soon so I wore them for a few hours and thought they’re not uncomfortable but they’re also not comfortable so I thought I’d buy some insoles and they’d be awesome. A few hours later I decided to get on the treadmill, only walking at a 3.0 for 30 minutes the not really rubber soles looked like the 1st picture and were shredding. So while these are super cool looking aesthetically speaking they are not for exercising. Before I added the insoles they felt ok but I felt the plastic I was standing on and having balance issues I needed more support and I returned them",2,0,26
"The purple is a really deep, vibrant color just like in the pictures. The shoes fit well and they're lightweight but there's something about the support that doesn't feel quite right for my feet.

My job has concrete floors and mid-way through my shift my feet are ACHING, far more than usual. I'm not able to wear these shoes to work if I'm scheduled for a full shift so I have to use them only on rare short-shifts.

They aren't terrible, they just don't work for my needs. If you're getting them cuz they're cute then they should be fine but don't buy them if you're going to be working 10 hours on a concrete floor. They definitely do NOT work for that purpose.",2,0,26
"I got the neon green and it's really neon in color!
The unique design is very much like another pair of shoes from another seller, so they are maybe made in the same factory.
This came in a ziploc bag and arrived earlier than the expected delivery date. These are not as lightweight as the other shoes, but everything else is identical - flame design on the sides, the plastic at the bottom and the thin rubber soles glued to the bottom hard plastic. I like that there is a pull tab on the tongue so it makes it easier to pull it out.
The vamp or front of the shoes is mesh so it makes it cooler and air out (I guess).
I normally wear 7 1/2M but from reading some of the reviews that said they come big, I ordered the size 7. They fit ok, wearing them with medium weight socks, but after about 20 minutes of walking around the house on both hardwood and tiles floors, my feet were hurting. I can feel the hard plastic bottom when I walked. Oh, and if you use your toes to toe the shoes off, don't! My toes hurt because of the hard plastic bottom.",3,0,26
"I am totally dissatisfied with this purchase. Shipping took way too long and the shoes did not come in a box. Who ships sneakers without a box? This is so low budget. On top of all that, I ordered a 9.5 in women’s and the shoe fits like a size 11. Now I have to spend my precious time mailing this horrible product back. The shoe is hideous in person and I’m pissed.",1,0,26
"I received the Tiamou White/Purple running shoe and was so excited. These shoes were so pretty. I couldn't wait to wear them. I am so disappointed that they were not as described as far as comfort goes. The insole of the shoes are super thin and after just a short time wearing them, I could tell there was no way I could wear these long distance walking. After having them on my feet for a bit and even just sitting, I could feel what felt like knobs pushing into my feet - almost like when you have a small pebble in your shoe. I think it was the sole of the shoe that I could feel. Maybe the shoe should be designed with a better insole to cushion your foot, and maybe I could buy an insert but I didn't buy shoes to have to add to them to make them comfortable. Sorry but these are going back.",2,0,26
Waste of money the only thing the shoe has was looks. After reading the reviews I decided to get the shoe for the gym and I sized down a size and still too big.,1,0,26
They just don’t support my foot,1,0,26
"When I first tried them on, I knew right away that I made a mistake. It felt like a ball sitting on the ball of my foot--in both shoes. However, I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and attempted to break them in with a 4 mile run. Over half way into my run, both of my feet had blisters in and around the balls of my feet. Even walking around in them casually isn't all that comfortable. I was personally disappointed because they do look cool but they aren't for me.",1,0,26
They fell apart in one week,1,0,26
"Not true to size. I wear a 9 and these are too small, not comfortable do not offer the type of support needed for someone with plantar fasciitis",1,0,26
"The shoes look great, and I've gotten tons of compliments on them. However, they run large (I exchanged for a smaller pair). Also, the bottom is extremely hard plastic and doesn't bend well for exercising. I wore them for a HITT class and part of a dance fitness class, and my feet were killing me. I bought insoles, which improved the comfort, but I would not suggest them for exercise classes.",3,0,26
The body of the shoe is too generic meaning it doesn’t have much shape. Like it is meant to fit a wide variety of widths. The sides are a bit stiff so it’s difficult to tighten them. The sole is just ok as far as cushion. Because they are a bit wider the toe box is roomier and I felt like I didn’t have enough support. So just average. The outside sole is very hard not giving like the picture might lead you to think. The color is fun though. Would not buy them again though.,2,0,26
"I normally wear an 8.5 or 9. Since they don't carry half sizes, I got the 9. When I walk, my feet literally come all the way out of the back of the shoe. I looked to see what size they sent me, there are no labels anywhere inside or outside of the shoe to indicate what size they sent me. Very annoying.

They seem comfortable. They do not at all squeak like that one video... I was hoping they wouldn't. And the white is white and not yellowed like like some shoes I have received from Amazon in the past.

But I cannot wear these while they're falling off. They look like they're the correct size, but feel like the backs are not supportive. Never had this happen before.",3,0,26
These shoes really hurt near my arch they are very hard. The dize is just right yhe right shoe is what's very very uncomfortable.,1,0,26
I.will be sending this back. Zero support. Made with hard plastic. No cushioning.,1,0,26
"The only thing I liked about these shoes was the color and design. As far as comfort goes, they were terrible, hard no cushion at all. I purchased them because it said they would help with back pain but the pain they cause in your feet is terrible. I don’t recommend these",1,0,26
"These seem like great shoes, but the sizing is crazy. I ordered a 9.5 for a little extra room. WAY too big. Ordered a 9 which is my normal size. Still too big. I'm waiting on the 8.5, hopefully they fit. Update: These are men's shoes. Why do they say women's in the description?",3,0,26
"I bought these because I walk a lot. I walk 6 miles on Saturday and 1-2 miles 3 times a week. I loved these shoes at first, they fit perfect, love the look but the rubber on the bottom has worn off quicker than I had hoped. I have pain when I wear them now in my feet, knees and hips. I started wondering why my feet were so sore, so I looked at the bottom of the shoes and there were some areas where the white was completely worn off. I switched shoes and I'm happy again. I bought them on May 2 and they lasted through July. Now looking for another brand that is made to last longer for someone who walks a lot.",3,0,26
"Do not run true to size too big! Wont wear them!

I want to send Back!!!!",1,0,26
"I wore it one time and it obviously was a waste of money. The rubber was just a hard rubber on your feet, no bounce, no support. Will hurt your feet and legs specially if it’s bought intended for long hours of working on your feet. Color was very nice. Didn’t know if I could still return it because I wore it already so out it went to donations.",1,0,26
"The soles of these are a hard plastic and not a more flexible material. After coming home from my walks my feet feel so tired. The right shoe hurts the top of my foot because the stitching of the tongue is off. It feels like something is digging into my foot. The other annoying thing is that when you take off these shoes, you can’t hold the back of it with your toes to take it off, because there is sharp edges in the middle of the shoe. I was super excited about new shoes, but am so bummed that these didn’t work out for me.
The color of the shoe is awesome and the fabric is a nice breathable material.",2,0,26
"The fit was odd, and the size wasn't listed on the shoe itself. I can't tell if I got the wrong size from what I actually ordered, or if there's just a size difference between brands. The sole felt lumpy and shoe gave me blisters from one session of walking. The color was nice and the design was neat, but the fit was terrible.",1,0,26
"Very Uncomfortable!!
Too Small/ my Toes cup Under!!",1,0,26
"I'm adding a star because the shoes are beautiful, but unless you're going to replace the insoles of the shoes they're not wearable. There's raised parts in the insole at the forefront of the foot rather than at the arches which makes no sense for any normally formed foot.",2,0,26
I’m a size 7 in just about every shoe. 6.5 in a few if they run large. These run large but there was not a choice for 6.5. The arch support feels good but after wearing them all day my left foot began to experience pain in the arch and I think because they are really too big snd the arch doesn’t sit right. The uppers and tread feel cheap. I’m going to keep wearing them hoping to break them in. I would not buy again,3,0,26
Sadly I’m very disappointed in these. Haven’t even worn them. The tongue is super awkward and sticks up a good bit. And honestly they’re not comfortable. There is an indent ion at the tow on both shows for some reason. Not pleased with this purchase.,2,0,26
The shoe fit as it should just the sole is very hard and not very comfortable at all. I returned mine.,1,0,26
I really would have liked to keep them but were very uncomfortable. They are cute though.,1,0,26
Use them for walking a couple of miles everyday. My feet and knees ended up in pain during and afterwards. They were even very sore through the next day.,1,0,26
Got in a few days time and so far they are comfortable and really light.I revised my review cause bottom almost gone and its not been 30 days yet! The thin rubber sole for traction is trash! Im so bummed about this! I would not reccomend!,1,0,26
"Have work these shoes for over a month now. Great for CASUAL wear ONLY! I purchased them for my neighborhood runs, but the impact support and running support you are looking for just isn't there. Casual walking shoe us good but the tounge of the shoe moves easily. So it's a good fashion tennis shoes but not an athletic or everyday shoe.",3,0,26
"I really like the brightness of this red and that the tongue is adjustable. They definitely run large, mine by a half size and they are heavier than what I had envisioned. These will probably rent space in a corner of my closet waiting for cooler weather so I can wear them with heavy socks. But, I'm in Florida so that won't be happening too often.",3,0,26
I will never order any thing from theses people again theses shoes are cheap and look not what I expected on the pic,1,0,26
"These look really cool, amazing color, but the insoles are incredibly uncomfortable. They are also weirdly big, like too stretchy. I wouldn’t wear them for running or long walks, but if you want a trendy looking shoe for school or something, this is a reasonably priced option.
Maybe if you replaced the insole with a different one it would be more comfortable.",3,0,26
"Thought these would look great with a tan. Runs extremely big. Ordered size 9, more like a 11.5 or 12.",1,0,26
"Way larger than normal size, stiff and made my feet hurt just trying them on.",1,0,26
"Pretty, poor quality",1,0,26
"Such a cute shoe. I was surprised by the hard plastic sole. I expected rubber. Also, the insole is pretty hard. I thought the insole might work, but decided they wouldn't. I've read where others have had a better outcome. I returned them.",1,0,26
"I gave it 2 stars only because they are really cute. The back flip flops, but my toes fit perfectly, so I can’t go down a size. I walked less than half a mile in them and my feet actually started burning. I got home (just over a mile total) & I had a massive blister on the bottom of my big toe. These are DEFINITELY not meant for walking or running - maybe just for looks when going out.",2,0,26
