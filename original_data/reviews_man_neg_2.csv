Burst seam on side after 3.5 months of relatively heavy use,2,0,23
"I bought this pair of shoes in the end of December, its now July 5th and they are smoked! Very dissatisfied with them! Would not recommend them to anyone! These shoes should last more than 7months.....",1,0,23
Absolutely the worst pair of shoes I’ve ever purchased.Factory defects and will never buy from you again.2 months old and completely shot.Typical corporate business passing on below substandard products to your customers.You may wanna take a look around as shafting the customers is actually shafting yourself,1,0,23
I’ve had a quite a few different kind of Adidas cluster one of the few you could still find 12 1/2‘s 12 is where most brands jump right to 13 and have never had a problem these are a little bit tight they’re nice sneakers but that mean even looks small compared to my other Adidas in Exton I’m supposedly the same size it’s probably just a difference in the cup but I’ve had a couple different style Adidas at 12 1/2 and incredibly comfortable these are snug right out of the box Amazon and the seller were spot on more common sizes are probably spot on but I particularly look for Adidas and 12 1/2 because they’re always perfect stuff first time they weren’t,3,0,23
"I think these shoes look great! However, these are probably the most painful shoes I’ve ever worn. But they overall hurt. Its almost as if they build the sole from the wrong material. Feels like my feet are walking on hard plastic. I bought some gel inserts but bc the shoes are already snug I’m trading one issue for another. I would buy one size up so give yourself some options.",3,0,23
"Maybe it's because I've exclusively worn skate shoes for the past decade, but these were really uncomfortable. They felt really thin and flimsy, no padding or cushion of any kind, and they rubbed a blister in my pinky toe. Decided to return. Think I might just stick to buying shoes from retail stores so I can actually try them on first.",2,0,23
"The sneaker is nice but they r just to narrow I cant keep my feet in them for more then a couple of mins,,I can deal with adding a different sole to them to give more padding but the tightness I cant",3,0,23
"I like the looks and feel of the shoe, but straight out of the busted up box, the shoes look like they have been worn before. There is creases already in the shoe. Not going to stop me from wearing them, it is just very disappointing.",2,0,23
Bought these in men’s size for extra width but the shoes were not comfortable at all. I needed shoes that offered ankle support. Sadly I had to return them,2,0,23
When I got these I was busy. So I couldn’t try them on. Three months later I finally got to try them. Way too small.,1,0,23
The look is nice. I like black on black.,2,0,23
"Good looking shoe but incredible narrow. I have narrow feet and usually have to avoid wide shoes, but these are unusually narrow. Also no arch support at all. So uncomfortable.",3,0,23
"Great beater shoes. One lip came larger than the other which looks wrong (and annoying), but overall good quality for the price",3,0,23
Not as cushy and two totally wrong sized laces sent. QC and QA need to step it up.,3,0,23
"Very narrow. I don't even have that wide of feet. Shoes with break in, very painful. Had to return.",1,0,23
"Very narrow, not recommended for those with wider feet.",3,0,23
I like the shoe the only thing wrong is that there is this glue like substance on on the laces on one of the shoes that won’t come off not the biggest Deal I already ordered new laces but still strange and shouldn’t have glue on the laces In the first place,3,0,23
These arrived creased in a destroyed box,1,0,23
"Super uncomfortable. Shoes bend stiffly to crush top of toes on each step
No give
No comfort
Had to give them away after one wearing",1,0,23
I’ve had these shoes for a month and they’re coming apart. My last Adidas lasted me 7 years. The glue on the bottom sole seems to be nonexistent. The pair that I got are junk.,1,0,23
The shoes look great but after only a week of wearing the soles were poking through foot pad... making them unbearable to wear...,1,0,23
Pulled the shoes out only to discover they had already been been worn by someone! The souls had dirt stuck in them.,1,0,23
"Shoes were already creased, box was damaged and came wrapped in a rubber band to keep the box from flopping open.",1,0,23
"Terrible fitting sole, like walking on concrete barefooted",1,0,23
"Good looking, but noisey and creases easily",3,0,23
My son didnt like it. They took a restocking fee of $32.50,1,0,23
Wore for 20 minutes and then bottom completely fell apart. Like the entire sole separated from the top part of the shoe on the right shoe.,1,0,23
"Soles aren't stitched on, just glued, came off within two months of not even daily wear. No wet or cold weather. Not worth the money.",1,0,23
These are the narrowest shoes I have ever tried to put on. Unless your foot is very skinny I would not recommend them,1,0,23
"they're an inch too long, quality but wrong sized",2,0,23
Shoe was too narrow for my feet,2,0,23
Bonito pero muy pequeño.,3,0,23
My father loved them.,3,0,23
"Soles a little clunky , f8nish a little ashy!! But they are wearable",3,0,23
Nice shoes. Just not right size,3,0,23
Very uncomfortable,1,0,23
"These are knockoffs of the real shoe. You can find the real one on adidas website, Hoops 2.0. Mid. The pictures reveal some differences that are noticeable.",1,0,23
The box was torn up badly the outter bag ripped open it was handled poorly during delivery and shoes were stained . I had to scrub the stain off the side of the shoe,1,0,23
The box came really damaged and the shoes don’t seem to be brand new they had creases already.,3,0,23
I can’t figure out if these are cheap knock offs or legit adidas shoes? They are nice but come in an unmarked box. The insoles are weird. Like too much in the arch. Different than standard shoes from a store. I’m undecided,3,0,23
"I have ordered these shoes for two reasons, 1) the price is cheap “ I paid $42” including everything
2) the color matches an adidas jacket I have “ olive green “
It arrived on time, I had to return it and exchange it for a smaller size because it was too large.
Lots of customers had the same problem.
The seller needs to add at the description that customers should order a smaller size than their size.
Another there is no “ made label” I don’t know where these adidas are made, I am not even sure whether they are original adidas or not
Overall, they are okay for the price. They are not very comfortable.",3,0,23
I wear a 9.5 Addidas samba so I ordered these in 9.5. There’s a good inch between my toe and the front of the shoe. I like the style and love the color I picked but they are just way to big. Based on the size it seems I’ll have to order them in 8.5.,3,0,23
These are not solar red as advertised. They are construction vest orange. Ugly,2,0,23
Normally I get the men's size because they are wider than the women's. The men's is very narrow both sides of my flat feet are hanging over the side of the shoe. Ashame cause they are a good looking sneaker,3,0,23
"These look pretty cool, very stylish. But they are not good for running, they are also thinner than most shoes on the sides so they could be uncomfortable.",3,0,23
They’re very cheap feeling and not comfortable.,1,0,23

Please read,2,0,23
Not much cushion or support in the insoles. I would not purchase again.,2,0,23
"Buen día, al recibir el producto y proceder a destaparlo, la caja viene totalmente destruida, pero los zapatos vienen en buen estado, lo malo es que me quedaron demasiado grandes, la guía de tallas no es muy precisa",3,0,23
"The color of the original does not match the photo.
I wore the adidas originals x_plr of the same size 10.5 US but these turned out to be larger than the size.",1,0,23
These sneakers look blue in the picture the sneakers I received look purplish. :(,1,0,23
fake and way too big,1,0,23
"After wearing these uncomfortable shoes from hell for a week, I developed foot pain on the outside. I still have pain two weeks after throwing them in the trash. My son received the same shoe, but a smaller size, and it took him two weeks to develop the same foot pain. He's been limping around for a week after tossing his. I can honestly say that these are the worst shoes I've ever worn, and I'm very upset that I'm still feeling pain as these shoes continue to magically stab my foot from the landfill to which I banished them.

Are these actually Adidas shoes or a knockoff? Maybe they asked Amazon to get rid of them, but they should feel bad about taking advantage of cheapskates like me.",1,0,23
"The shoe looks good, but I had to double check that I hadn't ordered a size 15 wide by mistake. The last 2 pairs of size 14 Adidas I tried were all really big. That has not been the case for me in the past..",3,0,23
"These are good for jogging, but I would not get these for trail running. Not the right sole, too soft for trails. Not enough support for uneven terrain.",3,0,23
"The style was nice, but the shoe itself has a large footprint. I have a small foot, and it was simply was too big for my taste.",3,0,23
"No es lo que yo esperaba en comodidad, es un clon del original Adidas, hagan la comparación, no lo recomiendo, me arrepiento de haberlo comprado, no es muy cómodo.",1,0,23
These are complete trash. Just bought less than 2 months ago and they have come apart. It seems like they are sown in when in reality they are glued. I tried to fix by putting a pin but wish I didn’t buy them.,1,0,23
"They're comfortable and fit as expected, but they separated the first time I wore them. They can be repaired, but that's pretty poor quality.",1,0,23
My husband wore his shoes out on the boat and came back to find his shoes had shrank 3 sizes and bowed up on both sides. Very dissatisfied with product,1,0,23
"I have been purchasing this style of Adidas slides from stores, for numerous years. The last pair were made in Italy, and were consistent in quality with those previously purchased. This latest purchase was the first time I have acquired them on line. These were made in China and are clearly made of lesser quality materials. They are much less weighty, and as such are less comfortable, and do not provide the cushion support of those purchased in stores. Being lighter in weight might be perceived as a benefit, but not at the expense of losing the support of a more quality made slide that carries the Adidas brand name. Price was not an advantage in this purchase either. While there are more costly slides available, the price to value ratio of those, are no better than these. Questionable also if P/V of these is a reason to purchase them.",3,0,23
"I wasn't looking for much. Just something to put on my feet that wasn't terribly uncomfortable when walking in the garage. At $13.00 the price was right, but the quality was somehow worse than I knew was possible. I'm not even sure if these contain rubber. It feels like plastic, and there is no give when you're foot is in it. Also they were a bit tight even though I ordered my usual size.

Really not sure how they messed this one up. If you're looking for something casual to wear out and about, keep looking. If you're looking for something for the shower or to take out the garbage that you don't mind losing at some point, honestly, just go hit up a Marshall's or Walmart. I bought some basic Adidas slippers for around the same price, and the difference in quality is crazy.",1,0,23
"When these were first made available in the U.S. (1980s) they were all the rage with my fellow athletes. They were super comfortable and extremely durable. You could spend all day in them! Now they're just cheap plastic, not the denser, more ""rubbery"" feel of the old models. The arch support is so high that they actually hurt my arches to wear them. The old ones also used to have a thin, cloth liner under the strap that made them extremely comfortable to wear. That's gone now. I wore these out to run errands for about 2 hours and only walked in and out of a few stores. The strap dug into the top of my foot so badly that I couldn't wear any shoes for three days. This used to be the most comfortable slipper on the planet. Now it feels like just another piece of cheap, Chinese junk.",1,0,23
"Update: I would give these negative stars if I could. I ordered a replacement and they sent me the same ones. The most frustrating thing is that I have adidas shoes with Cloudfoam in them and they’re so comfortable, so why can’t they get these right?

These are falsely advertised. I bought these because a friend of mine has the adidas slides with the Cloudfoam footbed and they are super comfortable. These are NOT Cloudfoam, even though it clearly says they are in the description. These are hard rubber and are very uncomfortable. You’re better off with cheap flip flops from a convenience store.",1,0,23
"These shoes are very comfortable on the feet. When I first tried them on they felt super nice and I was excited to wear them around the house. They are, however very small.

I wear a women's size 11, which I ordered, but I couldn't fit my foot into them. My feet are wide, so it happens sometimes. No big deal. I ordered the men's instead since they're always wider. My size is a men's 9. But I got a 10 just in case. Too big is better than too small. Except nope. Still too small. I could fit my foot in, but it was almost painfully snug and the back lined up exactly with my heel.

Because of non Amazon related delivery issues it was such a bother to just get the darn shoes that I decided it wasn't worth returning again. I'd just keep wearing them and see if they stretch out. Fortunately they did. They also mold to fit your foot after a little while. So they're very comfy.

But only if you wear them for a little while. Bumping around my house is no issue, but I live in a large apartment complex in the way back. Nowhere near the mailbox. I've worn them to check the mail a few times and by the time I get back, my feet and calves hurt. This has never been an issue before, and I wear flat sandals or flip flops for everything.

Additionally, these shoes squeak. On my way back from the mailbox I always annoy myself with the sound of the shoes squeaking. And that's just from a little bit of foot sweat. I can't imagine how awful they'd sound if I actually wore them in the shower as intended.

Overall, I don't hate them because they are comfy to wear around the house. But when they specified shower shoes, they weren't freaking kidding! These are NOT meant for wearing out!",3,0,23
"I ordered this product for my husband size 11. I remember clicking on the right size. When it arrived it was size 8. I thought ok maybe i messed up, let me reorder size 11. I clicked on size 11 go to check out, and of course i pay attention this time. It shows size 8, so pay attention it defoults to size 8. They are nice shoes, i will keep them for myself they fit perfectly womens size 9. My husband realy wanted them, he is going to be upset when he gets home and finds out what happened. Was really looking forward to getting them.",1,0,23
"These are ok to keep in your gym locker for shower after workouts/ Better to buy the originals, made with actual rubber, for gym, shower, indoor and outdoor use. The extra few dollars will be worth it. I've always used the originals but thought this time I'd try the Comforts. Actually they're not very comfortable, feel cheap so I gave these only three stars. The sole material is poly-something. I realize the material used is necessary to reduce the cost. The originals are made with actual rubber material for better wear, versatility, and are a much more comfortable fit and feel.",3,0,23
"I bought a pair of these at a brick-and-mortar store and LOVED them so much I wanted a 2nd pair. Shortly after, I ordered these from Amazon but the product is much different (and inferior). First of all the size 10 I got I can't fit my foot into and I have average width feet (not wide). Second, the sole material is a harder, shinny plastic rather than the soft-to-the-touch material that made the 1st pair so comfortable. The only conclusion I can make is that these are fake.",1,0,23
"We do not believe these are actually ADIDAS. They are hard plastic with no bend. There is no padding at all. It's as if they attended to shape it like a foot, but it does not fit a real foot. It does not look well put together, like they are already about to break.

These cost us $25, which was a bit of a splurge for sliders, because it's a Christmas gift for my son. But my husband's $12 sliders are much more comfortable. We compared them to my daughter's ADIDAS sliders, and they are so far off, it's just not possible these are real. They are so uncomfortable, we wouldn't want to keep them even if they were $5. But 25?",1,0,23
I like Adidas but dislike these shoes. I have disgusting roommates so I got these to wear in the shower. They fit width and length wise but have an extreme arch. Admittedly I have very flat feet but never in 40 years have I worn shoes with such an arch that my feet felt like they were being ripped apart. For the purpose of showering for 10mins they are bearable but I had planned on using them around the lake too which I definitely can't do due to major pain caused by the arch. For that reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because they do work in the shower for short periods. Its as fair as I can be for as uncomfortable as they are.,2,0,23
"These thin out in the toe area making them uncomfortable to walk in. You end up adding a lot more weight on your toes since they are sloped that way and are a lot less comfortable than my nike slides. The contouring also is a bit too steep so it feels awkward as soon as you put them on, especially since the material isn't that soft. I'd recommend getting a different pair that doesn't thin out in the toe area.",2,0,23
I have another pair in pink and love them but this pair is so scratchy on the top of my right foot and it hurts! It’s definitely the thread used at the very edge on the underside of the shoe closest to the ankle. I thought they needed to be broken in but that’s definitely not the case. I had to put a bandaid on the underside so help with the issue but that doesn’t look good at all. Not sure why the other pair had no issues but these do.,2,0,23
"The entire thing is made from this soft foam which makes it really comfy. The problem? The adidas logo cut into the heel portion of the foot, because of how it's cut, that part feels like it digs into your foot. It's noticeable right off the bat, even through socks, and quite irritating after a few minutes of walking. That being the case, this might all be a matter of the break-in period, which might go away after some time, but right out of the box is this slight digging problem that's small but noticeable problem. Will update after some time with them.

Edit: Break-in period over, problem still persists. After a full day, I found a backwards imprint of the addias logo on my foot, making me feel like I've been branded by the company. Not a daily sandal",3,0,23
"Worst quality ever. I took a shower and worn them, in less than a day the sides started coming off. One day later it’s completely off only attached with a very thin layer of rubber. Photos show the second day. I would not recommend. Either it’s fake or just super low quality. Get the Aqua version not this shower one for better quality and comfort",1,0,23
"I've had better sandals from a dollar store. I wonder if they are even authentic Adidas product as they are so cheaply fashioned and not anywhere close to a size 10 men's. (The strap going across is so tight, and I still cannot get my toes all the way under it - these are clearly women's sizes or children). I don't normally review products but I had to warn others. I searched by highest rated product when buying and man they are doing something fishy to have such good reviews. Even the sizing issue aside, the actual material is like plastic and feels like they just took some hardened packing foam and put a strap across it (and were so cheap they used an inch less of the strap to save even more money). I figuratively shot myself in the foot buying these instead of my normal brand because they went up in price. I adidas this to myself - don't adidas this to you - do not buy!",2,0,23
These slippers are not the most comfortable things you can buy. The material used to make them is kind of hard and you can feel the pressure from the surface you’re walking on transmitted through the slipper to the bottom of your feet. The support from the sole is almost missing. The fit of these slippers is also quite tight (small) and I would recommend that people with wider feet should go for a size larger than they usually wear.,2,0,23
"I purchased this exact style over a year-and-a-half ago from Amazon and they were very good quality: the edges were finished and secure and upper and footbed nicely molded. They were super comfy and have held up pretty well, but after 1.5 years they've loosened up a bit. I thought I would buy a second pair, since I knew the style and my size it would be a no-brainer.

When I first took these out of the package I was certain that I had gotten fakes from a third-party seller. But I checked, and the seller was Amazon.com. The quality is horrendous. The foam edges don't seem like they were finished at all and the entire upper is bent all over the place at odd angles.

I don't know what to make of this. Since I don't think it's likely Amazon as a seller would be selling fakes , the only thing I can conclude is either Amazon is selling defective merchandise, or Adidas quality control has gotten way downhill.",1,0,23
I initially purchased a size 10 which is my normal size but when they arrived and I tried them on I couldn't wear them all the way because of the super narrow shape. So I returned that pair and ordered a size up. When the size 11 pair came in and I tried them on I was able to fit my feet in them but it was still very restricting. I tried walking in them and it's very uncomfortable. It's a shame too since I love the look of them. These particular sandals are only meant to be worn by narrow feet :(,1,0,23
"I liked the price. I liked the stripes. That’s all.

Went to daughter’s swim meet today with my new “comfy” kicks. Pffft. My a$$! These Men’s size 10 Adidas Sliders are GARBAGE. The top of my right foot now has a cut on it from some sharp portion in the shoe. The right one didn’t stay on for some reason as well. The left one’s arch is like the stinking St. Louis bridge! I don’t know what human foot it is made for. Perhaps a chimpanzee. I’ve seen their arches. Pretty wild. My pinky toe on my left foot has a blister as well. Run a bit small too.

I just don’t have anything super nice to say about them. Just don’t get them.",1,0,23
"I ordered 1 size larger. They were long enough but they are extremely narrow and neither my husband or I can wear them. They are so tight just trying them on they rubbed badly on top of my toes and my out foot just below the pinky toe in bunion region. I don’t have a bunion but it felt like I did after I wore them a couple minutes. Within around 10 minutes I had to take them off because my feet hurt so badly. They do have a very nice arch support, especially from sandals/slip ons. My husband tried wearing them a couple hours in honors he could stretch them out for me. It didn’t work, so he suffered for me. It must be love lol. If you have very narrow feet then these would probably work but not for Normal or slightly wider feet. I would do an adjustable in those instances. Feeling let down because I really like them!!!!!",1,0,23
Order a size up they are not authentic adidas slides. ( I didn’t know hubby told me when they arrived) They tore up within a week of wearing. I bought them for my husband to put on after he is done working so his work boots can stay in his truck. I do not recommend.,1,0,23
"I ordered this shoe for my 11 y.o. I started with a size 6, children's. Then, a men's size 7, followed by a men's size 8. They were ALL the SAME SIZE. None of them fit! Thank goodness a major warehouse store got a very similar Adidas shoe in at the time we were trying to find a shoe to fit. I had to return the size 6, 7, & 8 to Amazon. The warehouse store had an Adidas size 8 that were just a smidgen too big, so we kept that pair. Yet the size 8 from Amazon was too small. I have no idea what is going on with the sizing of this Amazon shoe.",1,0,23
"These run a little shorter than true-to-size. The band across the top of the foot is a little tight as well. If you are right at the cusp of your size, size up.

Lots of arch support. Even toe support so you have something to grip your toes on so it doesn’t easily slide off your feet. Very spongy. Almost too spongy to walk in, but they’re comfortable.",3,0,23
"These sandals run way small and they are made for narrow feet. My feet aren’t even wide or at least I never buy wide shoes. My foot doesn’t fit comfortably in these sandals because it does not go all the way in because of the design. As far as size goes, I ordered a pair at my normal size and they were too small. I then ordered another pair a size up and they were also too small. I’d recommend buying two sizes up IF you’re going to buy at all. My overall recommendation would be to find other sandals.",1,0,23
"I can’t count the number of shoes I have owned… This is among the worst fitting… Oddest feel I have had—HORRIBLE IMO
It fits and yet feels small all around
Strangest feeling arch… That makes standing and walking feel as if you’ve got some thing under you in the wrong place
Definitely would not recommend and just can’t be bothered returning… How do you not get something like this right? The arch is just too far forward I think IMO did I say uncomfortable? IMO",1,0,23
"These aren't very comfortable. They have a scratchy irritating feel to the fabric part by the toes. Not a good quality for being Adidas. Wouldn't suggest. Thought they would break in, but now it's to late to return.",2,0,23
"These sandals have one of the largest arches I've ever seen. The description is accurate when it says 0-3 inches in terms of platform height. The top of the arch is literally about 3 inches higher than the surrounding sandal. Thanks to this giant arch, the sandal was both slightly too long for my foot and MUCH too narrow to actually insert the foot under the strap.
Honestly, these are the strangest shaped pieces of footwear I've ever encountered and I'd strongly recommend not trying them unless you know you have a strange shaped foot.",1,0,23
I have a few of the Cloudfoam shoes from Adidas and they are all super comfortable and amazing to wear for all day use....these not so much. They seem just as hard as a cheap plastic sandal.,3,0,23
"Don't waste your money, these are cheaply made and don't hold up. I've never had this experience with adidas slides before so I am deeply disappointed they started coming apart within a few months after they arrived. I bought them at the end of April and the strap started pulling away from the sides a few weeks ago. I usually only wear them around the house and occasionally outside when I'm running a quick errand. Other than falling apart, I will say the shoe fit is true to size and they were fairly comfortable and somewhat supportive, but what difference does that make if they only last 2 or 3 months. So sad 😞",1,0,23
Worn these slides 6 times in the month and a half. Walking to my mail box and the top of the slide became unglued and is unwearable. I’ve worn these slides from adidas for 20 + years and they usually last 1-3 years depending on how much I wear them. Been on hold with Amazon for 45 minutes and they are seeing what they can do to process a return or send me a replacement. The customer service representative gave me 3 options. 1) 20% restocking fee 2) contact seller and ask them to process a replacement or credit. 3) return item for a replacement and pay shipping. I think this is unrealistic due to the fact that these slides are only a month and half old and the product is a defect. Not sure if these slides are 100% authentic adidas. Never had any adidas slides come unglued after using them 6 times and are less then 2 months old.,1,0,23
"It's great to have grips on the bottom of the shower shoes, but you also need some sort of gripping friction between your foot and the insole of the shoe. I don't know why I need these, I could do just as well coating my feet with vegetable oil. They get very slippery on the inside and not on the outside when wet, and when you plant your foot to take a step the sliding of great concern.

Not sure what I'll use them for now. Spider smackers, maybe? Terrible engineering, Adidas. Steer clear of these things.",1,0,23
I got to admit they're very comfortable they offer a really good support but they don't last that long these things are ripped after about a month-and-a-half and I only use them in the night time when I'm jumping in the shower and coming out not to mention they're very slippery from the bottles I would not recommend them you know stepping out of the shower with them unless you have something on the bottom they look really nice so I wouldn't that but for your safety I would be careful in this purchase because they might rip like-minded or you might slip on them,3,0,23
I take a 10.5 shoe & that’s what I got in this & it didn’t fit it was tight on my feet! So I got a bigger size I believe it was either 12 or 13 & still was tight on my feet! Not sure if it is supposed to be like that but it was uncomfortable & had to take it back for the second time. So I’m going with the adjustable strap one when it comes in stock.,1,0,23
"I have an older version of this product that I've had for years but they are wearing out and I wanted to replace them. I received the new slip ons and noticed they seemed to be made of much lower quality materials than the older version I have. I decided to give them a chance anyway but after a few days, I had pain in my knees and ankles due to lack of the support. The soles of these slippers are very, very soft and cheap feeling with no support whatsoever.

Either Adidas quality has dropped significantly or the slippers I received are counterfeit. Either way, I am returning them.",1,0,23
"I have another pair of what I thought were the exact same slides from Adidas, both with CloudFoam. My last pair are getting worn out from three years of indoor/outdoor use and happen to be incredibly soft from day one. I was extremely disappointed when I tried the new sandals on because it was like stepping on golf balls with pressure points in spots of my feet that didn't make sense. The shoes are small, and very contoured, unlike prior versions. They are also very plastic-y feeling, which might have something to do with ""shower"" slides, but they do say CloudFoam, so what's the deal?",2,0,23
"The quality and make of the sandals was overall great. They seem very comfortable and would have loved to kept them since I have always gotten a long life out of this brand of sandals. However, this time around I decided to go with a different model/color and they were really tight around the actual foot. That is the reason I'm only giving it 3 bc it was too tight around the foot. Otherwise it would be a good set of sandals to use. Ended up just gifting this pair to a someone with smaller feet. So if you usually buy sandals at say size 10, but you want this pair get them in 10.5 or 11 to be safe.",3,0,23
"Purchased to replace a different style of adidas slides. The previous style was fantastic but unfortunately I couldn’t find it in my size, so I took a chance on these. Big mistake.

Pros:
* the grey & white is a nice clean look
* straps seems well made

Cons:
* the size 8 is tiny (I should have went a size up)
* the sole is hard
* almost no arch support
* ridges for toes are poorly place

I would send these back had I not wore them outside on a walk. They honestly free so bad, I’m starting to think they’re knockoffs. Back to looking for replacement slides.",2,0,23
"I look like a fool with these on in public. They are easily a size too big. I normally wear a 10 in Nike running shoes. Size aside, I had to take the thread out of the top edge because it was digging into the top of my foot, easy to do, but they were unbearable otherwise. My son's pair of the exact same slides didn't have this. I plan to wear these out and then get the next size down. They are very comfortable and I used to wear all the time in highschool/college before and after soccer...didn't know they still made them. Even more comfortable...but the old uppers were better IMO.",3,0,23
"I bought this Adidas Cloudfoam sandals as a comfortable substitute to my old Adidas sliders, but this turned out to be anything but comfortable. The upper part of the sandal is narrow and it squeezes my foot; the inner material is somewhat coarse and creates friction with the toes and sides of the feet. The sandals are not comfortable, although nicely designed and built. Total disappointment, and I am a big fan of Adidas sliders -- had them for 20 odd years in different styles...",1,0,23
"Poor craftsmanship. Somehow I would like a refund for my purchase of these Adidas sandals slides.
The top foot strap of these sandals has come undone from the outside edge. (See photo). The top foot strap of these sandals is ""connected"" with some kind of adhesive/glue to the outside edge of the sandals where it says Adidas. It was mistake to purchase these poorly manufactured Adidas sandals slides.",1,0,23
"I ordered four pairs of this slippers, non of them fit correctly. They are small and tight on our feet. I am very disappointed, my son has this slippers for really long time and they are so comfortable, I thought that I was buying same product just different size.",3,0,23
"Bought these red Adidas slides to wear in the house since we don’t wear shoes indoors here. These were highly rated so I got them to replace my Jordan slides. First, they look great with vibrant color and have the classic three stripes. Unfortunately that’s the end of the positives. I have an average width foot and these are crazy narrow. With and without socks on I have to JAM my foot in to get them on. I didn’t take pictures without the socks on to spare everyone the sight. The bottoms scuff SUPER easily so after trying them on they are ineligible to return. The pics of the outsoles are after JUST trying them on a wood floor.",2,0,23
"I got these because I wanted flip flops I could wear with sandals. I'm glad I ordered the size that's usually a bit larger than my normal size, because these turned out to be smaller than expected. These aren't comfortable. I guess they're fine for putting on without needing my hands when I need to put something on to take out my building's trash at night once a week, but otherwise I don't think I'll wear these much, because they aren't comfortable.",3,0,23
They are a smidge too small. These shower slides are one piece plastic similar to crocs. I was confused as to which type of slides these were since they look the same and are both listed as adilette style. I like that these have the adidas written on the side. The picture shows 2 different adidas slides; the shower slides (right) and the cloudfoam slides(left). The ones on the right are these shower slides....which I will return because they run small. The one on the left is the softer cloudfoam slide which I love.,3,0,23
"I bought these to replace some really comfortable Adidas slides I got from Costco, which they no longer sell. I could not believe how hard these were. It was like walking in plastic (like hard plastic). I immediately knew this was a mistake and regretted getting them. This is one of the problems with buying clothes/shoes online... you cannot feel the item to see what you are getting.

If you need some outdoor slides to slap the crap out of some attacking wildlife, these will do. If you wanted even an ounce of comfort, move on to something else.",1,0,23
"I purchased a ""Male size 11"" for my husband, but these were so incredibly small he couldn't even get his full foot on them. They did fit my feet though, which is a Female size 7.5/8. Although I did not send them back or write the review right away when I purchased them, I am still quite disappointed in this purchase, as we did not receive what the right product. I did keep them because they did fit me, however, they are pretty uncomfortable and only wear them when I need to run outside real quick and then back into the house. Definitely would not recommend purchasing these off Amazon, I would suggest going into the actual store and trying on sizes.",1,0,23
"I bought these for my son. My son wears a men’s size 9 and I did listen to the reviews and went up 2 sizes to an 11. They don’t fit him. I wear a women’s size 9, which I believe is a men’s size 8. And I can barely cramp my foot through the opening. So please don’t waste your money, and they say cloudfoam but they are not!! Please don’t waste you money!!",1,0,23
"I have been wearing Adidas sliders for years, ever since my kids started playing soccer. I have one pair I love. I'm getting ready for back surgery so I thought I'd get another pair as it would be easy to put them on without bending over. The new sliders are terrible. They weigh about 2 oz. They provide no support that I notice. If I wear them more than 5 minutes the top of my right foot. I had torn the plantar fascia and I know it needs support. The original sliders feel fine, the new ones are definitely an inferior version.",1,0,23
"about 2 sizes too small. are these rejects from adidas or something? it has bulges on the bottom near the heal where the foam was cut… but it isn’t cut flush- reminds me of what a rejected product would be. disappointed, but? usually am buying footwear or clothing online as opposed to in person. would not purchase again, not even a correct size.",1,0,23
The slides seemed great and had support where needed but the straps being non adjustable really limits the fitment. I wear a size 12 a d my right foot is slightly larger than my left but not by much. This was enough though that my right foot would not go into the straps. The left was still tight too. And as anyone who where’s slides a lot knows they wear and stretch over time which is another reason adjustable straps should be standard. I had to return the item as they just did not work for my feet.,2,0,23
"I used to wear flip flop in my home with wooden floors but because of winter and cold I had socks on, so as you can imagine flip flop doesn't work that is why I purchased this one. comparing these two, Adidas isn't as comfy also, I usually buy a size 10.5-11 shoes from both Adidas and Nike but the size 11 was small and really narrow for me so I had to exchange it with size 12.",3,0,23
"I can see these working well for smaller feet. I'm Size 13 (US). All my shoes fit well and are Size 13 (US). These arrived in the box with the Size 13 tag attached, but the arch was too small to fit my foot through. I felt like I was going to break the strap fitting my foot all the way through. They're very light and cheap feeling. I paid around $22, but the moment I picked them up I did not feel like I was holding $22 of value. Returned them, got a refund. I'm glad they work for so many others, but these slides didn't work for me.",2,0,23
The material on these seems decent. The foot shape is not. If you have flat feet I would definitely not get these. The mid foot area is so hard and high it feels like your stepping on a golf ball. After wearing them for a little while stepping on the floor barefoot felt very strange. I could still feel the strange mold of these sandals on my foot.,2,0,23
"I normally love these. I think the batch was made defective since having read a review of same complaint. The top piece that goes over the foot was cut too short. My feet are normal, but can’t hardly slide into the tight space. The foot bed is good. The shoe is not. Will be returning. I will go to a store for another pair.",1,0,23
"The foot strap is completely not flexible. So unless your foot is average or small thickness or width, there is no give to the strap on these at all and will not fit anyone with a higher arch or wider foot. Had to give mine away to someone that normally wears a much smaller size than what these were supposed to fit.",1,0,23
"I’ve never had a slip on like these before. Me and my husband laugh about slip ons like this and call them our prison yard sandales. They look nice but to my surprise they were a size to a size and a half too small! Bummer for me, but my husband got a new pair of slip ons/prison yard sandales. I’m going to reorder a different pair that’s a size bigger. The original size I bought were 10’s. Will try some 11’s now!",3,0,23
"I am incredibly disappointed. I ordered male size 11 as I am a 10.5 and I enjoy a little room on my house shoes for comfort. At first, I thought they sent me women's shoes. I think they feel like a 9 because I have to jam my feet in. After about a minute, I'd lose circulation.

I was feeling less hot on Nike and thought I'd go for Adidas. Save your money and look for another shoe because you'll probably give them away. These were supposed to help me keep my floors clean, but all they have done is help keep the Adidas shoebox full.",1,0,23
Although I love Adidas clothing an shoes I ordered these slides an I had to return them. They were very stiff an the bottoms where ur foot walks on where very hard an they flip flop to me was just very stiff I did t like them at all. I bought a pair of the same in navy blue from the store an they were super soft so I ordered these online thinking they wud be the same but they looked the same but didn’t feel anything like the navy blue pair I bought from the store. I wouldn’t recommend them if your looking for comfort. The gray color was exact as shown but I just couldn’t deal with how stiff they felt on my feet,1,0,23
"I got these because the left one of my old pair of Adidas slide sandals finally came unglued from the base on one side, after many years of use.

It looks like Adidas has cheaped out on these latest ones, made in Vietnam. The previous ones (made in China) were a bit roomier for the same official size 11 and also had an adjustable two-part band with Velcro, plus they had a nice textured insole. These are pretty plane Jane by comparison, and not as comfortable. We'll see if they last.",3,0,23
"I bought several pairs of Adidas slides and just this pair came in much different and way smaller, even though they’re labeled the same size. They look to be knock offs which is really disheartening considering these came from Amazon. The stitching is different the molding is much cheaper you can’t read the sizes very well they look & feel like knock offs",1,0,23
"I have a pair of Men's 9's identical to what I ordered here. The order says men's 9 and this review popped up as a women's shoe. Regardless, this is not made of the same material, it's hard plastic and not comfortable and is definitely not the same size as the 9's men I ordered from Adidas directly. I would investigate this seller because I highly suspect these are fraudulent products. I'm returning this garbage immediately. If you don't believe me, order a pair of these from Amazon and a pair from Adidas.",1,0,23
I wear an 11...ordered an 11...fits like a 9. My son wears a 10 and still could not get his foot in these. I can't even get my toes past the straps. If they are going to sell these like that just say order 2 or 3 sizes bigger. I assure you the 11 is not an 11. Sent them back for a refund.,1,0,23
"I have had Adidas sandals before that were amazingly comfy and come in an Adidas box...these time this pair was a big fail, I’m so dissatisfied about the fit, I feel like I have my feet inside a plastic bottle with no support, no good shape, nothing, makes my arch to be stressed, my feet get tired after wearing these for more than an hour awee! I don’t know if these are authentic Adidas “I doubt it”, they came in a clear plastic bag, no box, no wrapping paper. Im so disappointed because I can’t even return them since I’ve already wore them. They’re going to the trash can, waste of money!",1,0,23
"These slippers Broke right after the Return Window and they were used only three times. The strap is cheaply glued on the base. They fell apart on the way to the beach from the car, 50 yard walk. My son didn’t even make it to the sand…. Very poor quality. We do not recommend.",1,0,23
"First strike was the fact they're not true to size and the size ordered did not fit me. I expected it to be a little loose based on my shoe size, but instead my foot was sticking out on both ends. They also felt far too plasticky compared to my last two sets. I would not recommend them based on the lousy feel, and the improper sizing.",2,0,23
"Ordered 2 for my sons. Different colors and sizes. By the second day, wearing at a beach resort, their feet and toes had horrible blisters right where the sandal crosses the top of the foot. We’ve never had this issue with competitive brand flip flops/sandals. Will stay away from these Adidas in the future.",2,0,23
"I am very disappointed in these sliders. They have the Adidas name on them and the famous three bands, but they seem to be a poorly made knock-off. They are constructed so that when I slide my feet inside them, my feet are skewed to the side by the top portion (the part with the bands) and don't fit correctly into the footbed. That makes them very uncomfortable to wear, and they don't stay on well. Could they be a counterfeit imitation?",1,0,23
I ordered up a size for my teenager as the reviews mentioned (he normally wears a size 9.5 to size 10); I ordered the size 11 and my son could not get his foot to slide all the way in because it was too narrow under the band part of the shoe. I am returning and will be ordering something different.,1,0,23
"Nice price point, but my son got painful red marks on top of his feet when wearing them. I tried wearing them, as well (we are the same size), but I also experienced pain and bruising. Cushioning the foot with a pair of socks helps, but certainly doesn't win any fashion awards. Wish I had gone for a different sandal for him.",1,0,23
"I ordered the male equivalent size but these are made for slim feet and because of the padding I always have to squeeze my feet into the slides at first and get used to the feeling.

Also, it wasn’t trimmed properly and so there is extra plastic around the bottom",3,0,23
"it was cheap when i bought it. it was around 22 bucks. unfortunately it isn't that comfy compared to the cheap nike's sandals. i ordered the same size as the nike one and this one is way too tight on your feet compared to nike's. if you want to order these i say get 1 size above what you usually get. either way, the tight feeling on your feet (especially sandals) is an uncomfortable feeling, but that's just me.",2,0,23
Are these kids sizes and I misread it? These are way too small for my boyfriend's feet. First pair we got were his normal shoe size and he couldn't even get his feet into them. So we exchanged them for another pair that were 2 sizes bigger and they're still too tight for his feet...,1,0,23
"I'm not a big fan. I've had other Adidas slides and liked them better. These slides have a big cushion in the middle of the foot, which might seem like a good idea, but I thought it felt odd and a little uncomfortable actually. Worse, though, is that the strap on top began to rub or dig into my foot --the back edge of the strap toward the heel. I have a red mark where it has rubbed my skin. And I was just wearing it around the house. Seems like it would be much worse if I were walking for a while.",3,0,23
"You will definitely need to go up at least one size. My size 8 was waaay too small. My feet hurt trying to break them in around the house for a couple hours. It was so bad, I returned them the same day they arrived! Didn’t bother getting a new pair. I’ll just take my refund.",1,0,23
"The product was very uncomfortable, and the seller would have charged me about 80% of the cost to ""return"" them. Ridiculous. If shoes don't fit or feel right, they should be free returns if never worn. Will never buy from this seller again.",2,0,23
"Don't buy these sandals. When i received them i tried them on and the greases feeling on the sandals made me take them off and clean them with hot soapy water. It didn't do any good to clean them, they felt just as greases. Also the size is off by one size to small. Not worth the money. Invest in a better sandal. By the way mine are now in the trash, wasted $20.00 bucks. i will never buy an Adidas again.",1,0,23
"Had maybe a week, before the strap going over the foot started cracking. Plus if you want to constantly slip while walking cause the material does not act kindly to those who’s feet sweat. You should definitely buy these, because they’ll make your life more adventurous with not knowing the next time you’ll eat it when trying to walk to the refrigerator to get a snack.",1,0,23
I got these for my boyfriend and he has regular feet not narrow not wide and it feels like these slides are meant for men with dainty paper thin feet. His foot did not make it in under the strap so we returned and got him some Nikes,2,0,23
"the stitching on the inside of the inside top has rubbed my feet raw! this has to be a design flaw or I got a bad pair.
I will not be able to wear these without socks which is useless. I hope they will accept a return as they have been worn outside.",1,0,23
"These run small. I ordered a men’s size 7 for my son, which is his normal shoe size (he’s 12), these were way too small. His heel hung off the end about 1” and his toes were all the way at the top of the slide. Ugh! By the way, his foot from heel to toe is 9” even, I ordered a size 7 just to be safe and they were still at least an inch too short for him.",3,0,23
"Product fit perfectly, and would have been absolutely perfect if they weren't broke coming straight out of the box. The box was also not so pretty and looked like it went through h*ll and back. However, I made an exchange and sent them back. I did recieve another pair within a few days but we chose white this time and nothing was wrong, fit perfectly and very comfy. Still waiting to hear if amazon has received our return item, because im a little worried they may charge if they don't receive it.",1,0,23
Not all that comfortable not a true 12 a bit short kinda high up for a slide ... almost like a woman’s shoe ... wore them around the house for a week with and without socks to try and get use to them ... will get a better pair before summer and save these as back ups they were cheap enough...,3,0,23
The size for a 5 is way to small the slide itself is cute but the sizes really run small idk maybe because I tried to order in a boys for a cheaper price but around the time they didn’t have my size anyway so I chose a 5 and it came smaller than what I expected,3,0,23
"The strap on these Adidas Men's Adilette Shower Slide are too small.
I purchased a size 13 pair, while the shoe itself could fit my foot the strap where I slide in my foot in only allowed about 3/4 of my foot to fit making these shoes useless. While I have a large foot I do not have a swollen or particularly wide or fat foot. I would avoid this product.",1,0,23
"This is quality/well made, but I sent it back and opted for something less expensive. It was too much money even for the quality to spend on flip flops. I mean they are just plastic/rubber and you can find them cheaper that fit well and do the job. I just wanted them for the beach or gym.",2,0,23
"1: these shoes are way too small! I bought them for my teenage son and my 10 year old daughters little skinny feet wouldn’t fit in them.
2: I returned these April 21, it’s May 23rd and I still haven’t gotten my refund! Don’t waste your time or money.",1,0,23
"First the sandals look great and my feet don't feel slippery when they are wet. The sandals have and arch to them which was a surprise and feels uncomfortable to me. The strap over the toes feels ridged and when walking it cause the strap to dig into the top of foot. It might take some breaking in, so I'll post a follow in a few days.",3,0,23
It fits in length but it’s tight on your foot and it seems to be cheap quality...Also like I said it fits the length of your food but the shoe fits very tight maybe after it broke and it might feel better but I’m only keeping the product because it was cheap enough not to return it,2,0,23
"The footbed is unsupportive, and the strap is uncomfortably tight--I have high arches so I could not slide my feet into the sandals except painfully. I won't have this problem now as they are in the garbage can!",1,0,23
They look great but they are very cheaply made. I've been wearing mine around the house for only a week and the strap arch has completlely detached from the base of the shoe rendering them useless. By the looks of it the strap was connected to the bass with nothing more than glue. Consider I only wear them to walk from my desk to the kitchen they should have lasted allot longer than a week.,1,0,23
"I wear a size 10.5 medium shoe and I purchased the next half size up an 11 medium. The shoe was too tight and too short to be an 11. And yes, the box read an 11 medium. I did wear the shoe for 3 weeks without any significant movement of the shoe to fit the contours of my foot. If the fit was correct, this would be a very comfortable and stable shoe.",2,0,23
Leave these in the sun one time and they will be junk. The old version didn’t shrink in the sun. The new ones are far inferior and if you leave them by the pool once you’ll come back to slides that is three sizes smaller. So disappointing.,1,0,23
"Got these for my husband & they are NOT for men with wide feet- AT ALL. His feet aren’t even exceptionally wide, we have never had any other problems with any normal width shoes, so I figured these would be fine. He couldn’t get his foot into these at all. Not good for anyone with a wide foot!",1,0,23
There is no way these are real Adidas. I have several slides and they are all so comfortable and Soft and most importantly say ADIDAS on them. These dont. They’re hard. There’s not bend to them so they hurt and nowhere on these do they say adidas. It’s like they’re made out of plastic. My feet want to slide around in them.,1,0,23
"These are supposed to be used for just the shower but I use them for everyday usage. Because of that, I definitely feel my feet get sweatier than other slippers. They are pretty basic as far as comfort but feel durable. Time will tell. I would buy another set but only for the bathroom/pool/spa. They would have to be dedicated to wet scenarios.",3,0,23
"Idk why the strap has to be so tight. My fiance is skinny, and doesn't have chubby feet or anything. It's weird how tight the strap is. Should've gotten one that allows you to change the tightness. Ugh.",3,0,23
"These slides cut up the tops of my feet. I wore them for about 2 days, they weren’t comfortable but I figured maybe they needed to be broken in. When I was going to bed the second night, the tops of my feed were irritated. The next day I could see they were scratched up from them. Super weird. First time going with Adidas slides too, won’t be trying again.

Also, I bought a size 12, which is what I wear in every type of shoe or slide. I’ve worn size 12 slides for over 10 years. Just wanted to clarify that they weren’t too small.",2,0,23
"I wear a 9.5 in other Adidas, so I ordered a 10 In these. The length is perfect leaving about an inch for my foot to move around, but the strap is loose. I’d order a 9, but I worry that they’d leave my heel at the edge of the sole or off the sole. I’ll probably just wear these around the house since they fly off if I’m not careful.",3,0,23
Got these thinking its same as all black but I was wrong. These were not as comfortable as the all black ones. So I returned these for the black ones with I have 2 pairs and my wife has one too. The black is more comfortable compared to these.,3,0,23
Definitely not like the normal cloud like Adidas slides but the color is nice. If I could do it again I would’ve just went to the real site or a sporting goods store and bought the better ones. Theses are simply for the pool so it’s ok.,3,0,23

"This not what i ordered... and I live outside the US.
I ordered a particular pair of slippers, I just received them from the person who brought it for me and to realise that what I ordered is not what I got.
And to make matters worse they dont fit.
Adidas is my favorite brand and when I purchase a particular item I expect to get that exact item.
If it's not available let me know so at least I can make a decision.
I AM DISAPPOINTED",1,0,23
"I think it's fake, if not and this is original Adidas, shame on them! It feels really good, but after 1 month use they are reaching for the sky :)))) you can see on the picture how their form changes. It would be understandable if it happened 6 month or 1 year later but after one month?! Shame on you Adidas :)",3,0,23
Tight fit. Adidas has changed the slide over the years. I preferred the old style without all the different supports. Not as comfortable as before but will do for short periods of time. Seller gets 5 stars.,3,0,23
"Looks and feels cheap. All plastic. My both feet are the same size, but while the left shoe fits well, the right is too tight. I hope to be able to stretch it a bit, little by little.",3,0,23
"Originally gave 5 stars but as you can see, Just 37 days later & wore less than 10 times & its falling apart. Obviously not durable. Returns cut off at 30 days. If they can't make a product that holds up better than this they should give it up. Will never buy again.",2,0,23
"My husband usually wears a size 12 but we got the 13 for ""comfort"" and they were way to tight on my his feet. We figured that they might stretch over time but he felt like the strap would cut into his toes and we didn't want that. They seem like good slides but we had to return them. Now we aren't sure if a 14 will work or if we need to try a different brand.",3,0,23
There is no padding on the underside of the strap that goes over your foot. The result for me was that the seam at the front of the strap rubbed against the top side of my toes. Very uncomfortable and it was immediately clear that these wouldn't work for me. This was returned and I found a better pair elsewhere.,2,0,23
"Very uncomfortable to wear, feels too much squeezed. Feels like walking on a hard stone. The size chart is wrong-headed order one size more than what it says yours might be. For return/replacement, they are asking me to pay $6 towards the UPS store. Eff that.",1,0,23
"Purchased to use as a shower shoe at work and for traveling. There is no doubt that they are waterproof. That’s the good, the bad is that they are not comfortable at all because they are so firm.",2,0,23
Looks very nice it is comfortable besides the logo underneath your feet that you can feel it while you walking besides that I will buy maybe a half size larger but will definitely buy it again good product it is durable for children,3,0,23
"These have to be cheap knock offs. We have purchased several pairs of these slides and my kids will wear through the soles but they have never just fallen apart. These are super cheap and the strap came off of the bottoms after only a couple of months. Don't waste your money on these, just order directly from adidas.",1,0,23

"I'm usually a size 8.5 women's and a 7 in men's (sometimes a 7 men's in Adidas is a smidge big due to the width). So I bought the 7's thinking they'd be perfect. I couldn't even get my foot in them. Like at all. They were ridiculously small. I don't know if they all run small or if I just got a pair that were incorrectly sized. That said, the return policy was stellar and I had no issues getting a refund.",3,0,23
"We liked these sandals at first but they quickly have shrunk in size too much when we left them outdoors on the patio (despite being Spring time). Their shapes also deformed quickly (the back of the sandal got curved making it very uncomfortable).
Unfortunately I cannot recommended them.",1,0,23
"These are comfortable for use in the house, not to be used in the shower or anywhere where there is water. The material absorbs the water and it takes a long time to dry. I’m concerned about mold… but I still use them. Keeping an eye out. The worst is when I used them to shower after being at the pool, and driving home with the AC on and wet feet the entire time.",3,0,23

Really disappointed about the product,it’s not even been one month,the sandal already starts breaking.

They are really comfortable, but I won’t settle for a pair in bad condition.",3,0,23

Pretty upset as these were super comfortable and my first pair of slides ever. Hopefully I can get them replaced",2,0,23
"I returned these a day after I received them. These didn't smell like rubber when I opened them up, they smelled like stinky smelly athletes foot!! It was disgusting!!!! I don't know if it was because it was during the summer and they were hot on the truck all day, or they were previously worn by someone with athletes foot. It was awful!!!!",1,0,23
"The slides are far too tight to be at all comfortable. I find myself just dealing with the soreness they produce for my feet any time I have to use them. I have attempted to let them loosen up through regular use and I have even tried to simply stretch them out myself. However, these slides are horribly proportioned. I have never had a problem with tightness before with adidas, or any other footwear brand at this size. I suspect my pair will find its way to a thrift store, or landfill. Either way I hope whoever finds them has feet proportioned like a particularly narrow fish spatula.",1,0,23
I got a size 12 I always get a size 12 every time I get shoes or sandals or flip-flops. for whatever reason this didn’t fit. Maybe go for a size up or try to find a wider size. I gave mine away to a friend. They fit him perfectly but that’s because he wears a size 11.,1,0,23
I feel like I lost $25 dollars. This shoe and whatever the size would be is considered a narrow.,1,0,23
"I bought a pair of these in black two years ago and they are extremely comfortable. They are so comfortable that I wanted a second pair. These are not the same at all even though they are the same size, style, and brand. The loop over the top is a lot tighter and is generally uncomfortable. I am returning and buying something else.",2,0,23
"I don’t think these are the same as before. I have bought several pairs over the years which felt as soft as a wrestling gym mat.

These however, are hard as hell and I wonder if they’re real adidas.

I’ll try find the other buyer and spend the $30. On a good note the Grey color looks nice and for $13 it’s ok.",3,0,23
They came used with dirt on the bottom and the box was completely beat to hell. Ordered another and noticed it had a the paper in the shoes like you would get in the store. So I guess they don’t check wether the product is worn or not.,1,0,23
"They look great and they are made out of a nice material. However, they seem very tight. I bought them for my father but they were too tight for him so I wear them. But they were too tight for my fit too. So i gave them to my wife but she didnt like them. So now I gave them to my mother but she says she will give them to my sister’s kid. So here you go. 4 ppl had them but no one wants to wear then.",3,0,23
"They look pretty cool, and the materials are decent. They really hurt my feet though. The arch supports are in the wrong places, and the straps pinch, even though I sized up.",2,0,23
Besides the size running about a full size smaller they are extremely comfortable. Probably the most comfortable slides We’ve bought. My husband wears a size 10 to 10.5 sneakers so I ordered an 11. He will definitely need a size 12. So make sure to order a size larger than you would usually wear.,3,0,23
I purchased this as a gift for my brother and the sizing is very small. These run very narrow and are definitely not for those with wide and or larger feet. It was pricey to send it back so I ended up just giving them to another family member.,3,0,23
"I actually returned my real size and ordered a size up but the band is just way too tight around my foot, and I don’t even wear wide footwear, I wear regular just fine! I can still manage it, but the band that wraps around the foot is just way too tight. Will not be purchasing these again.",2,0,23
I purchased these sandals for my son's birthday. I thought the sandals were going to have a soft material so when you step it's smooth not hard. I wasn't looking for the hard plastic kind. I did keep the sandals. didn't want to go through sending them back. Maybe someone else would like that kind of sandal. It just wasn't what I was looking for.,3,0,23
"I’ve bought at least a dozen pairs of Adidas Slides over the years, but these don’t fit like the previous ones. The instep is too high so my feet don’t stay as secure. I don’t think I’ll order more unless I can try them on first.",3,0,23
"My husband did not like these. I ordered his regular size and he said they were too small and slipped around on him. They smelled funny and had a cheap plasticky feel to them. I swapped them for the Adidas ""comfort slides"" version, which are more expensive. But he says those are more true to size and way more comfortable and don't feel cheap.",2,0,23
I've worn a 10.5 Adidas sneaker most of my life. These shoes are barely to big for my wife size 6. The description said accurate sizing so I did I would like to exchange this 11 for a 13,2,0,23
"These like many other slides are way too narrow. My husbandcwears a 10.5. I git an 11 and he could not get his foot in at all. No, he's not fat either. I guess these are for European men? No clue",1,0,23
"I bought a pair in the beginning of July. Only used them to wear out to the pool/hot tub at my house. They fit well but the rubber caused irritation and rashes if you walk in them while they are wet (or your feet are wet).

The strap popped off today, not even 3 months later. Check out my photos. For the price, I’d expect these to last a bit longer than 2.5 months. Maybe I just got a bad pair, idk…",2,0,23
"Too stiff. Does not conform to your foot shape to make for an easy slip on. I have to use my hands to pull it all the way on and then its not ""comfortable"".",3,0,23
"This may have been made for ducks not for human it most certainly did not fit I tried stepping on it, squeezing my feet in and with no progression I could not get my foot in properly. You may want to order a size or two larger I'm prepared to have over 2 inches of extra sandal in front and back sticking out of your foot.",1,0,23
"Fit is great. Support is alright. They're pretty good, tbh. But I can't get over the rigid top-foot band that kinda digs into my feet... I will look for some that are more flexible or elastic on the top band. I'm a female and I wear size 8 in men's or 10 in women's. US sizing. :)",3,0,23
"The Adidas website has Adilettes that are slightly more expensive at $30 but feel a lot better than these ones. These feel less durable and comfortable in comparison, although they are much lighter for walking around in.",3,0,23
"These are fake!! I ordered my son a size 6 in kids size and a 7 in men's for me. His are bigger than mine!! Also, the bottom has a large bump that makes it impossible to walk!",1,0,23
"I ordered these thinking they were like my previous pair no they are pre molded for someone's foot. Not mine, probably not yours but maybe Cinderella? They are hard uncomfortable and I hate them zero stars. Tried to return that was a scam",1,0,23
This show is very uncomfortable it runs extremely small and extremely narrow it's the absolute worst slide on shoe I ever purchased in my life ..very cheaply made and I would advise to stay away from them never buy these narrow tiny shoes.,1,0,23
"Good quality but run way to small said men’s size 11 but gave them to my mom who they fit perfectly and she is a size 9 women’s, plus slim fit. Would not buy these again. That’s my mom wearing my men’s size 11 😫",3,0,23
"I'm normally a 10 or 10.5 size but even a size 11 in these shoes are much too short and narrow for my feet. Looks like they'll be going back. I will say that they seem well constructed and the insoles are comfortable, but it's hard to give a full review when I can't walk very well in them.",3,0,23
Sandals are even more poorly constructed than you imagine. The band started pulling away from the sole within a week and has had to be glued back multiple times. Garbage.,1,0,23
"These slides fit wierd. There is a bump on inner sole that pushes foot into top of slide. Left slide is noticably smaller than right slide. Narrow and odd fitting, not like other Adidas slides...maybe a knockoff.",1,0,23
"Liked the look and style but the opening was too narrow for me personally; they fit but were tighter then I’d prefer. Opted for the same brand, different color but with the adjustable Velcro strap and those fit perfectly without needing to adjust the strap.",2,0,23
"Nose si son originales o no, vienen en caja que pareciera original, pero bro; si esto es original adidas ha perdido mas calidad que las hamburguesas de tu local favorito.",2,0,23
"First I ordered black men’s size 11. I wear 11 in every adidas shoe I own. They were way too small, I could barely fit my foot in. The next pair I received was black and white, which is not even on the product listing page. I want a full refund.",3,0,23
These slides seem to run very small. I ordered a size 12 and they don't fit the person they were intended for. I was able to give them to someone who wears a size 10 men's.,3,0,23
Don’t buy these. I bought these for my son in law to just wear around the house nothing drastic. First: they didn’t fit they were to small and I got the correct size. Second: he made do and they lasted 3 days before they came apart. Not satisfied,2,0,23
They are true to size and nice looking. Very stiff non flexible shoe. Band across top of shoe cuts into toes. I have skinny feet and they are very narrow.,2,0,23
"I rarely buy shoes online and this is a perfect example of why.
1) I wear a size 9.5 and ordered a 10 and they are still too small should have ordered an 11.
2) I did not realize they would be hard plastic.
3) I do not feel comfortable returning shoes because I wore them for several hours hoping they would break-in but they only got more uncomfortable as time went on.
4) Total waste of money for me.

Some people may like the feeling but not me",2,0,23
These deserve a zero star. These are made for women. A man's foot cannot fit in these shoes without being extremely painful. My husband said these are the worst shoes he's ever had. Worse quality than Walmart and it's shameful that they have the Adidas name on them.,1,0,23
I ordered my normal shoe size and they would barely go on my foot. Ordered 2 sizes up and they are still snug. Sizing is very off.,1,0,23
"I ordered these shoes in a men’s size 8. That’s what the tag says, but the shoes are at least two sizes smaller than my roomy old Addidas size 8s and the quality is far lower. If the shoes stretch a bit, I’ll be able to wear them, but I wouldn’t buy them again.",2,0,23
This item runs large. Not of best quality.,3,0,23
"Seemed oddly set up, as if your toes should be tiny. The built up areas meant to provide support are in completely incorrect regions, based on my actual feet and my simple basic understanding of human anatomy. Overall i am slightly disappointed. Feet are scrunched forward in the footbed in an uncomfortable position to fit the contoured design. Adidas failed on this simple footwear.",3,0,23
Not very comfortable. I feel like the top part is too small and there's no adjustment it is what it is so my foot occasionally slips out. It's not comfortable but does what I need it to do I guess.,2,0,23
Not comfortable. The strap is not adjustable nor is it flexible and the edge over the toe is a little sharp. The padding doesn't hold a candle to regular slides. 2 stars for style but I will never wear these. :/,2,0,23
I wear a size 10-1/2 or 11. I bought size 12 to make sure they would not be too small. I had to exchange them for size 13. The 13s are still too small.,3,0,23
"As others have said, the toe box is a bit snug. For me it just felt too tight despite going a half size up. They also feel pretty cheap like styrofoam. But they look nice and do the job.",3,0,23
they way too small .I got them for myself and km a size 5 in men which is what I order but they're more for a child then an adult,1,0,23
"I had some other adidas brand slides (the ones with the weird nubs on the feet) and they were great, lasted years. I just didn't really care for the nubs on them. These slides are terribly uncomfortable. It's already ""worn in"" with an indentation of a foot that doesn't match mine. My $5 slides are way more comfortable than these.",2,0,23
"Horrible shoes, even for shower slides. Cheaply made and are not the advertised sizes. I'd guess they run 2-3 sizes smaller than labeled. I discovered this after ordering 3 pairs in an attempt to get the correct size. Will be returning all 3 pairs.",1,0,23
These run small. They might as well be youth shoes,1,0,23
"My husband does not like it , he said the slippers too hard , make his feet not comfortable, and a little too big than usual size !",2,0,23
"Very disappointing. Inaccurate description of slide. Cheap feel.

Normally I’m a size 10.5 in shoes, I ordered an eleven, it fit like a nine. I double checked the tag and it says 11. This makes NO sense! Where is the quality control?",2,0,23
"I thought these slides would be more comfortable, perhaps a little softer. It's my first pair of slides, though, so perhaps they are all like this. They do the job -- easy slip on shoes for a quick step out of the house, and easy slip-off when back inside.",3,0,23
"They definitely run small and really narrow. Not comfortable at all. I ordered them for my husband and they're even snug on me. Keeping them, as we tried them on with bare feet and that's gross to return lol",1,0,23
"this is for men and runs extremely small. we ordered this for my husband and instead of returning it i will wear it myself. so definetely a man would need to order size or sizes up to be able to wear this.
update: very uncomfortable. horrible.",1,0,23
No even a month and falls apart I bought it here just to avoid to go to the store but got my lesson the ones at the store last a year.,3,0,23
"These won’t fit in a million years, will be regifting to my dad who has much slimmer feet.
I was a little disappointed in the quality as well, I don’t feel that these will last very long but I guess only time will tell!",3,0,23
Not worth it super hard to get your feet in I am a size 9 and could not even slide my foot into the size 12 because the top part is glued too close to the shoe. Also it's glued on so it'll fall apart,1,0,23
"Love the look when I saw them in an ad. They are cheaply made and certain they would not last. All the other size 9 i wear, this one was as close as you can get with my heel right at the very back. They run small. Returning them.",2,0,23
"Not true to size. Bought them and they were too small. And I even got them a full size bigger.
Update: I just got the second pair in and they are still too small and these are two sizes up. I don't understand why they are so small",1,0,23
"All my footwear is size 12. I ordered a 13 incase they ran small by mail order.
The size 13 pair recieved is too tight, I can't slide my feet into them.",2,0,23
Not comfortable felt cheap. I left them in the sun for 3 hours and they warped under their own weight. They are either fake or Adidas really cut back on quality,1,0,23
I’m a size 11 and that’s what I ordered and they were to small also they feel to plasticy if that makes since very uncomfortable,1,0,23
"So, I have purchased very similar Addidas slides just like these in the past. I have always bought a size 12, so I know exactly how they fit and feel. This pair is smaller than all the others I have purchased in the past. There is very little cushion and the shape of the arch support is awkward and not in the correct spot. I am so disappointed because I thought this was a no brainer, but clearly they have redesigned and made this much less comfortable and much less true to size.",2,0,23
I wear these around the dorm and when I shower. I've had them for maybe just under a month now and the band becoming unstuck from the sole. Them being comfortable is completely pointless if they've fallen apart and can't be worn.,1,0,23
The most uncomfortable shoe I've ever used. These are definitely not made for flat-footed people they have the highest Arch I have ever seen in my life insanely High,1,0,23
There’s something that seem not original about this adidas slide. Very different from the original adidas slide I was trying to replace .,3,0,23
Every other pair of size 13 shoes fit without issue. These slides are way too narrow and fit too tight. My feet keep sliding out of them because they’re made too small,2,0,23
These things are meant to last. I bought it for my dad and it’s only been 2 months and he almost slipped twice as they just skid and don’t provide protection. Now I have to spend money and buy another pair.,1,0,23
"Sad I bought these for father's day and they are a female size 8..It says mens 11 but they are not!!!....Ordered again!! A man's size 11 is actually a size (""13"")...
I would have given you 5 stars but your sizing is wrong!",3,0,23
Bought a size 6 for my daughter and they are way too small the sizes are no correct. They are a men’s 6 which should be a woman’s 8 and they are way too small,3,0,23
Runs small. I've had 2 other styles of Adidas shower slides and this is the first that runs small. Also not as comfortable as the other 2 versions by a long shot.,3,0,23
"Saw what I thought was the same shoe in a local store, but theirs was so much softer, more flexible, and much more comfortable. These were returned.",2,0,23
My 11-year-old son who wears a men’s 7 could barely get his foot in there they’re too narrow and too short it almost makes me feel like they are knock off. I’d spend a little more money and get some thing better quality.,1,0,23
"Probably the most uncomfortable flip-flops I've worn so far. There's a weird bump which I think is supposed to be for arch support, but it actually puts a lot of pressure on the nerves. Do not recommend buying these.",1,0,23
"You get what you paid for I guess! I’m normally a size 10. These slides were too tight so I sized up. Still wayyy too tight. Judging by these other reviews, the band probably won’t last very long.",2,0,23
"I don't what in the pressure points are in the flops, but after the second wear, I immediately took them off. There's a tingling, sting-like feeling I feel right away, when I've had them on. I have other slip-on's and don't have that problem AT ALL. It actually feels like someone is poking my feet with thorns in those flops. I was excited to finally get a pair of their flops, just to be disappointed.",1,0,23
"The slide part of the sandal that keeps your feet on the sole is uncomfortable. The fit is not too tight, but after walking a mile in my new sandals there were cuts on the top of my feet. I can't recommend these as I haven't had this problem before with any slide sandal.",2,0,23
My family has had several pairs of Adidas slides over the years. All of a sudden they seem to run narrow and they never form to you feet.,2,0,23
I ordered a size 13 and they are no where near the right size not a good value since I can't wear them I suggest you order these really big if you can,1,0,23
Bought this for my husband and it looks good. Physical appearance is good but he told me it’s not comfortable to wear. There is something in the side of the slippers that is hurting his feet.,3,0,23
I thought these were the soft slides but they are NOT. the plastic is hard. I'm returning and buying the right ones. if you are looking for the super soft bottoms you should buy the adilette slides instead not the shower slides.,3,0,23
This version has weird stitching along top front toe edge which is really uncomfortable almost unwearable. They old rubber version was better.,2,0,23
"I'm flat footed - wore these for about 10 minutes and had to take them off before I crippled myself. As I said my feet are flat, have always been flat and will always be flat. the padded instep was much too painful for me.
Yes, the looked good, yes they were well made ... but I don't have an arch so wearing them was going to cripple me.",3,0,23
Ordered for my son but way too small. He was very disappointed. He wears a size 10 and these were not wide enough for him to slide his foot in,1,0,23
"I wear normal men’s size 10.5 I purchased an 11 for a little extra room. My foot wouldn’t even go through the slide, it’s like their possibly woman’s? But say men’s.. my toes wouldn’t even come through the other end!? Their way too narrow! I don’t require wide shoes ever! Don’t purchase.",1,0,23
Quality product however they fit quite small. I wear a 9 and 1/2 but had to purchase size 11. They also are very narrow so if you feel that you have larger than normal feet from the size that you wear thenthese are not for you.,3,0,23
"These seem like fake Adidas which I wouldn’t expect from Amazon. Very disappointed, it’s so obvious they’re not real because the quality especially the sole is horrible! Beware!",1,0,23
"Just a little bit pricy but totally worth the price. Everything else I am satisfy with. I wish there is a cheaper alternative to the slipper. But oh well, I probably will wear this for the next couple years.",3,0,23
Look great and seem durable but have massive bump for the foot arch making really uncomfortable to use. Wouldnt recommend. Worse part is i have 2 pairs and unable to use.,3,0,23
If you have high arches you may want to look at something with an adjustable strap. I found these to be pretty uncomfortable.,2,0,23
The band holding your foot in the sandal is flimsy. It doesn't feel comfortable or stable and you have to jam your foot in. I wouldn't recommend this product for use.,2,0,23
"The top part of the slide is in extremely uncomfortable, it had a hard plastic feel and the edges hurt my feet. I wouldn’t wear this even if Adidas pays me a salary every month.",1,0,23
"The strap is made of a foam material that starts to stink if not dried completely before being stowed away in a bag. I had to throw mine out after only a few wears because the smell became unbearable when I put them in a bag overnight while they were still a little damp. However, they were comfortable.",3,0,23
I received the wrong item. Instead of the item being the open slip on as shown on the picture. I received the thong flip flops. I am not able to provide a review for the item shown on image.,1,0,23
Bought these for my husband - the footbed is so hard. It's like walking on a rock. Returning.,1,0,23
"I bought these to use getting from my pool to outdoor shower, walking on hard surfaces and gravel pathways. They are so uncomfortable that I tried them once and quit. Also were sized a bit large. A flaw in the design of the fit of the toe area. The arch was OK.",1,0,23
These are a bit more stiff than the regular Adilette. This is what makes them waterproof. They are good but different than the supersoft standard.,3,0,23
"While these are cute, they are snug. I am a US size 11 in women (9 in men) and the 9 is a little too snug. The shipping is super fast.",3,0,23
this would have been a five star review because I love how comfortable they are and I think they look super cool but unfortunately they began to tear where the top attachment meets the front part of the sole of the sandal after a week and a half of very light wear inside the house only. I probably only wore them 4-5 times total before noticing the tear. Bummer bc I thought I was going to love them. Will be returning them.,2,0,23
"Way small. Returned this within 2 days. Also rubs the top of my feet.

I’m
A big fan of adidas gear. This was way too small and very uncomfortable unfortunately",3,0,23
This is way too small. I’ve been wearing the same size Adidas sandals for years and these I can’t even get my foot into it.,2,0,23
"These are somewhat comfortable slippers and they fit fine but they feel very Low Quality and I don’t think they will last in the long run. They feel really light but flimsy, like they’re made of inferior quality materials. You can even see the exposed glue keeping the things together. Kind of overpriced if you ask me.",3,0,23
The shoes are well made and very light. I don’t know if it’s because it’s a “men’s” shoe or if they are just made large and wide but I would order 2 sizes down from your true shoe size if you’re a woman. I usually never write reviews but I’m trying to start bc it does help to see what other people say about the product. Reviews have saved my butt many times.,3,0,23
"I have pretty good posture, but after putting these slides on, they would not fit straight and went crooked and the comfort was really lacking.",3,0,23
"The wife wears a women's size nine and these fit her perfectly. I ordered men's size ten. Unacceptably, comically small.",1,0,23
"I purchased US size 13 (printed on the slides themselves, in Amazon description, and on the shoebox). They are 3/4'' shorter than my old slides, and are too small. It's a clear labeling mismatch.",1,0,23
"These sandals must have been irregulars since the left shoe fits considerably tighter across the top band. The hassle of returning something for $20 is not worth it. On another note, I did like the pair I recently received in navy.. which is why I ordered the scarlet color.",2,0,23
"These shoes are not durable in any capacity. I purchased these one month ago and at first I was really happy. But within a few weeks the sole started breaking down. And now, one month later, it is starting to fall apart. I don't beat these up either. I have a desk job and do some light walking and around the house stuff. Don't waste your money.",1,0,23
"The shoes are comfortable, the color is just as described on the pictures and overall look good. The fit is as expected. Although a bit narrow, but this is very common on Adidas shoes.

The reason for my low star rating is the quality of the shoes. I might have gotten a bad pair, but my shoes (both) had the sole inserts get separated completely from the shoe. They lift so easily that I think they might have missed the glue step in the factory. This happened/was noticed on the first time i wore my shoes. I could not recommend this to a friend.",2,0,23
"I received these shoes Aug 7th 2020. Today, September 3rd 2020 I took the picture of the sole. They really felt like nice shoes and they fit well as an initial taste. But not even a month of use and theyre basically bald. DO NOT BUY FOR OUTDOOR WALKING OR RUNNING USE. I have MAYBE 150 miles on them and they look like this. I’ve walked more miles in a pair of vans. Do not buy. Huge waste of money as they simply do not last.",2,0,23
"Difficult to put on, the shoe has no way to open the top is like a sock that doesn't expend. I may have tried to wear it maybe it would get stretched out. The reason they went back is that my toes were hurting within a few minutes. As a diabetic ( YA don't mess with my toes.)",3,0,23
"They are comfortable except for the fact they run about a full size small. I originally thought it might be a half size but after wearing them for a few hours, its definitely a full size small. I love the ease of slipping on and off, nice cushion, but they are killing my feet because of the size issue. I should return them but its a pain so I will probably just donate them and get something else. Definitely SIZE UP",3,0,23
"But not much else. It’s a shame I was hoping I could replace some New Balance with these for working on home projects and running errands but not so much. These are extremely light weight which is good but that’s the nicest thing I can say about them. Other than that they feel like slip on sock shoes. Almost no arch support or heel cushioning. Even the toe box area tends to hurt after awhile. If you’re wanting to get these for appearance reasons and occasionally stepping out then have at it. But if you’re looking for something to wear for a few hours a day, I wouldn’t recommend these at all. Which is a shame because Adidas are a go to brand for me.",2,0,23
The shoes feel like knock offs. I could not get them on my feet into the shoe! I bought this shoe with the idea of using them as some casual sneakers. I am an adidas person since the 1970's and have seen the company go through cycles. The 1980's were terrible. We are back there. I am returning.,1,0,23
I did not like them too much. It is okay for the money but I rather pay more and have something little bit more expensive that is higher quality. In my opinion this not for working out. It is more as fashion shoes if anything.when I do work out it do not have an firm grip on the ground.I do not recommend them.,3,0,23
"My boys have always liked Adidas shoes, but this pair was a waste of money. After wearing them just once, the silver started coming off of the stripes on the side. A couple more wears, and the sole began coming apart on the bottom. What a disappointment since we cannot return them to Amazon or Adidas because it has been more than 30 days. I will think twice before purchasing Adidas shoes again.",1,0,23
"This was the first shoe I have worn that honestly caused foot pain for days after wearing. I bought two pair, in grey and black and wore them over the weekend; this decision caused a week long bout of discomfort. Also, they are at least a full size too large after light wear, and no support, or rigidity to keep foot secure. I wear Adidas and have for years; I will look closer at their products moving forward. Adidas quality control missed the mark on these junkers; you dont want them for any price.",1,0,23
"I love these shoes and have them in another color. Unfortunately, these are not the same color as what’s shown in the photo. There are three different tones of white/off-white used that clash with each other. The grey appearance is actually a much stronger black than I was expecting. Also, the silver is much more reflective than any of the material they’ve used in the other colors. I was sad that I had to return them given how they looked.",2,0,23
Got these for my boyfriend who wears a 12 in almost all his shoes. Got these and I’d say they are a half size bigger so I’m returning them for an 11.5 and will see how that goes. They shipped fast and look really nice . Will update once we get the other pair,3,0,23
"I love the look of these shoes and they are comfortable enough once you get them on, but that's the problem... they are a pain in the a$$ to get on and off! The shoes don't have a traditional tongue and laces to loosen up to get your foot in. Instead it's all one shape and while it does stretch a bit to get your foot in it doesn't stretch enough to make it easy. I love Adidas products, but I would not recommend these to anyone ...",1,0,23
"I've purchased two of these shoes. First of all, had to share a photo of the boxes they came in, just hysterical. Don't know what dumpster they recovered them from. Now onto the review; amazing comfort and the look is great. As other reviewers mentioned, there are weird, non-elastic bands on the shoe. If you have a narrow fit, they stick up in a strange manner. If you have gunboats, they will impede the shoe stretching out and fitting comfortably. I took some scissors and cut them off. Didn't impact the look and was a lot more comfortable.",3,0,23
"These shoes arrived, they are supposed to be size 12. They are extremely tight and difficult to put on and take off. the length is correct but the width and the height are awful. The sole feels like stiff hard plastic almost no give.. All my other sized 12 shoes fit perfectly fine..

Return process is painful. If I could give these a zero stars I would.",1,0,23

"Had the shoes for 3 months. I wear them once or twice a week and they are now ripped. The shoes are a waste of money because of how fast the material rips, even if you don’t wear them often.

EDIT
The shoes did rip in about 3 months. I used them 2-3 times a week just walking.",1,0,23
The description didn't mention that there was almost no give along the sides and over the instep to spread the shoe to.put it on. The shoe fits abit snug but the real problem is getting them on,3,0,23
i have the same shoe (model/color/rev) in the same size and wanted to get an replacement set but these are not close to the same shoe. i'm not sure whats happening but these need to go back. i will try and get them from another source.,2,0,23
expected more from a leading manufacturer ... my feet need wide shoes so i go over size as standard procedure ... but with these my feet are on the sides over the edge for the soles ... and they are longer than usual so not happy,3,0,23
In less than eight weeks the fabric foot lining of the sole peeled away from the bottom rubber sole. Making these shoes capture foot odor and making them impossible to take on and off without the rubber sole pulling out.,1,0,23
"I order these “woman’s adidas sneakers” only to receive them and find out they were actually an 8.5 in men’s. I’m a 7 in men’s sneakers so obviously I couldn’t even make this work. I returned them and stated that men’s sneakers were sent to me instead of woman’s and re-ordered thinking it was a mistake and it would be an easy fix. When they arrived, I received the same thing. Men’s 8.5 sneaker. The tag inside says “male/male.” I’m disappointed because I wanted these sneakers.",1,0,23

"Comfy lightweight shoes, but far from durable. Bought these in mid-July--and they are completely destroyed by early October. They were worn frequently, probably every other day or so, by a pre-teen, but even with frequent use, I expect more than 3 months of wear from a reputable brand like Adidas. Definitely not worth the money.",2,0,23

"$70 for shoes that are the correct length for a size 12 but the shoe can only be placed on the foot if you're an 8 year old with a size 6 as the opening is ONLY LARGE ENOUGH for a size 6 entry. You look at them and ask yourself, this can't be right with the entry this small?
Adidas used to be a great brand. Now....not at all if these are the current examples!",1,0,23
"a hole has appeared on the left shoe. Upon purchase, the sole of the shoe was too smooth to achieve traction.

I will not buy from this seller again.",2,0,23
Very comfy slip on and off. Shoe strings do tighten the shoe in place. Size is much larger than normal size eleven. I did buy another pair in black size 10-1/2 and they are a bit tight but so fit. Too much variance in 1/2 sizes,2,0,23

"Good fit, comfortable, easy to put on, color more like a powder blue.",3,0,23
This shoe looks nice and is lightweight. But putting them on is a pain as there is no stretch in the white bands. Makes it almost impossible to get on. Once on they are comfortable.,3,0,23

"Uncomfortable and they are not waterproof. I thought they were.

I play golf using a golf cart early in the morning when there is some dew on the grass. No rain and no puddles and minimal contact with damp grass, yet my socks are wett after 18 holes.

Why would Adidas make a golf shoe that is not waterproof or, at least, water resistant?",1,0,23
"I had tried on size 13s in a store but they were too narrow, so I ordered a pair in ""13 wide"" from Amazon. When I tried them on, they felt exactly the same as the 13s. The box said ""13 wide,"" but the tag and the tongue did not. Since there are dozens of other reviews and questions referring to the same problem, it seems that this is a systemic issue and Amazon is shipping regular-width shoes in boxes that say ""wide."" I am returning these shoes and will not try again.",1,0,23
"I need a wide show, and the listing for this shoe said it was side. Looking at it however, it looked very narrow, and fit the same. My feet were hurting within minutes of wearing them. I tried twice walking around to see if they would break in, but they didn't. Also I've learned that many shoes in the label put a E if the shoe is side. There was not such indication in label size of this shoe. I think it would be a good shoe, if it fit me.",3,0,23
"Ordered 12W. As others have noted / asked, the product really is not WIDE. The box says 12 WIDE, but the tag indicates 12D, which is medium in US nomenclature. The shoe's length is fine - just as I expect for a 12 in US sizing. But the width is a bit narrow mid-foot, and is exceptionally TIGHT in the toebox. (Admittedly, I have a wide toe-box. Love the old Reebok CF Nanos with their wide box.) Also, it's rather tight over the top of my mid-foot. (Admittedly, I have a very high instep (?), such that I need a wide AND tall toebox.) I do believe the shoe will stretch a bit and will be much more comfortable over my foot. Much more concerned about pinching in the toebox. So I will continue wearing at home in an attempt to stretch it out.

On the plus side, the shoe is exceptionally light, and the sole has good gripping power, albeit this is dry / summer weather, so less critical. If the shoe stretches out, it will be comfortable with THIN socks (no way can I wear it at the moment with thick socks).",3,0,23
"The picture does not do it justice. Nor, do many of the reviews. Only found one that said the shoe runs narrow and has a narrow style.
So, I ordered them a size larger than I normally wear. It is a good thing.
They are long for my foot, but fit tight on the width.
If I returned them, I would not buy this shoe again, as the style does not fit my feet.
By design, they are long, skinny golf shoes.",1,0,23
I have always worn a size 10 1/2 wide shoe. According to Adidas size chart I decided to purchase the extra wide golf shoe in size 10 1/2 after comparing their measurments to my actual feet measurements. The shoes seem snug at first and after playing 1 round of golf I removed the shoe and found my sock a bloody mess. Their shoe are at least 1/2 size smaller than advertised and not near an extra wide as advertised. Ended up giving them to my grandson who normally wears a size 10 normal width. He said they fit perfect. I will never by shoes online again unless I'm sure the size advertized is accurate. Extremely disappointed in a brand name shoe. I'll stick with Footjoys.,2,0,23
Reviews are good for this shoe and apparently its the #1 selling golf shoe on Amazon however I've played 6 rounds in the spike less version and had my feet slip a couple of times costing me strokes. I would return them but threw the box out when I opened them. Ill just use them as walking shoes but I definitely wanted to warn others not to go this route unless you don't require traction. There is a reason Pros still use metal spikes after all and its not so they have less grip to the ground.,1,0,23
"The shoes look pretty good and feel comfortable while walking and wearing. My problem was that they were very difficult to put on. I had a hard time getting them opened up enough and the back was so flexible there was nothing to help me pull them on. I usually wear a 10 1/2 size and these shoes are size 11, so one would think they would go on easier than they did for me. It was difficult to spread the laces open far enough so that I could slide my foot inside. I had to physically pull the laces, one by one back down the lace channel a long way in order to manage the task. I think they might be a bit easier if I carried a shoe horn with me.",3,0,23
"I have wide feet and these fit great, but they do not keep your feet dry with wet grass from morning dew. These are also a lot of trouble to clean the wet grass from the bottoms. Due to these 2 issues, I'm going back to wearing running shoes; they don't keep my feet any drier, but are a lot easier to clean. Would not recommend these unless you play on dry courses. I removed the cleats and started wearing them again, but now the fabric has stained yellow. Looks awful and will not come clean. Save your money and buy something else.",1,0,23
Shoes tore at sole within 6 months of use. Amazon wont entertain any requests since the order is over 6 months old. Adidas says i have to go back to amazon. so i'm stuck. be careful.,1,0,23
"I was hoping to get more than one season (of summer golf) from these shoes. But that didn't happen. While comfortable, they were not the least water resistant given the porous material above the molded sole. The fact they were not water resistant wasn't a surprised or the reason I don't like these shoes. It was when the molded sole separated from the upper shoe portion that prompted my low rating of these shoes.

If you want a sturdy sneaker-style golf shoe, don't buy these. My suggestion is to purchase anything made by New Balance and you will not have wasted your money.",1,0,23
"honestly these are great but... one of those ""dangerous to buy online"" situations. keeping them as they work great but the heel design is the ""two pronged"" version that i should have noticed. be prepared to band-aid up at the start at least. then tend to run a tad thin to boot imho (i have never ordered or worn a ""wide"" for any shoe but these feel like i should have. both issues are solved to some degree by lacing up very loosely and with high backed socks. honestly it's a good show but know the above before you buy :)",3,0,23
"I saw other reviews that sizing was identical to sneakers. For me, as soon as I saw these I knew they looked small. I wear a 10.5 - 11 so I bought 11. I could not even get my foot into them fully unlaced! I thought maybe they were womens, but it says ON THE SHOE, they were 11 Men US. I figure I will need a 12 to get into them but that size jumps in price. Returning to buy a different shoe.",3,0,23
I like the look of these shoes and had originally ordered the Medium width which was too tight. Normally I wear a 9.5 Medium. I returned those and ordered these Wide width and could barely tell the difference. I have never tried on a Wide shoe that felt tight as usually they feel to loose. These probably won't fit most feet comfortably. Too bad because I like the shoe and it looks nice.,2,0,23
"I've worn these for about 5 rounds now and the more walking I have to do the more my feet hurt. They're simply just not comfortable to me. I'll be spending a bit more next time and getting a better quality shoe.
Last round was cart path only and holy cow... My feet were toasted afterwards... I'd just assume wear my everyday tennis shoes than these at this point....",3,0,23
"I ordered this golf shoe in 11 wide. They are still way too narrow for my feet. I played 9 holes in them one day and then 18 the next hoping they would get more comfortable. They hurt the side of both feet where my little toe starts. Just not wide. I suggest anyone definitely needing a wide golf shoe do not get these.
I find a sneaker shape shoe in wide is better for my feet. I thought I would try these for the price and and the reviews. I even got a 1/2 longer than usual and wide but just not wide enough. I probably will just end up giving to someone.. Do not order these if you require WIDE shoes.",1,0,23
"I have a pair of Adicross Classics in 9.5m that I have been wearing for a few years. I found the sole and insole to be completely flat and it was causing issues after walking a full 18. I ordered the Tech Responses in a 9m figuring they would be a little more snug and have a better arch. Not only is the insole super flat but the toe box is much narrower at the outside edge so it pinched my pinky toe in. I didn't wear them for a round as I knew after a test fit they wouldn't work, but if you have a normal to wide foot these may not be for you.",3,0,23
"I wear an 11.5 in all my athletic shoes and I buy them often. So I got these in an 11.5 wore them for a 9 hole half round and my right toes were killing me. Probably too late to ask for a return since I wore them and they are sort of useless now. I'd call it a defect as the left shoe feels fine, but how do I prove that. Amazon if you screen these, what should I do? They really are garbage and that is where I'm going to put them if there is no return value. They clearly are not sized to a true 11.5 and the build of these shoes is very cheap.",1,0,23
"Have several adidas and these fit, length wise, perfect. I thought they would be more like sneakers and not require a break in period. Wore them to walk 9 holes and got blisters on the ankles. The ankle support area is very rigid. They will probably break in eventually but be warned. Wear high socks when breaking these in and stick to carts only until you know they won't hurt your feet.",3,0,23
"I have 11B foot size when measured in a shoe store. I have 11N foot joys that fit perfectly. I read reviews by others that say this shoe runs on the narrow side. I have a narrow foot. I figured an 11 would be fine. My big toe has about a 1/2"" room which is perfect but the front is a bit pointed so my little toes are getting cramped. The front of the shoe should have been more rounded versus pointed.
The shoe is light and comfortable for 9 holes. After that my little toes start to scream.",3,0,23
"I have owned several pairs of these shoes and in the past have recommended them highly for value and comfort. However, something has changed in the quality of the product. The photos above show the shoes after only 6 months of use, mind you, only being used a day to two a week. They are literally falling apart and are an embarrassment to wear any longer. Adidas thinks this is just fine and what I should expect apparently, as they refuse to acknowledge that there is a problem and just cite their ""policy"" for standing behind their products. I cannot in good conscience recommend anything except staying away from this product.",1,0,23
A comfortable shoe overall. I am hoping that wearing them in may stretch them a bit. I ordered wide and they are very tight. I'm hopeful that in time they will be as comfortable as they look. At the price you will be hard pressed find anything better. Just order 1/2 a size larger and a full size wider than you usually have,3,0,23
"Looks great. They' aren't water proof, but I wasn't expecting that anyway. I've had a lot of great Adidas golf shoes (like the AdiBoost). Almost didn't keep these. But added a pair of Dr. Scholl's padded insoles and they'll be fine for walking 9 holes.",3,0,23
"I've had these golf shoes for a little less than one year. The good points are they fit well and are pretty comfortable. The bad points are they are not water resistant at all and they are falling apart. I know they were not claimed to be waterproof but I thought they would be somewhat resistant at least to morning dew...not at all! Also, as you can see from the photo, they are starting to fall apart. Not clear from the photo, but the sole is also starting to separate from the top. I also bought a gray pair a month after these and they are also deteriorating. Sorry I cannot recommend these shoes.",2,0,23

Three stars for the price",3,0,23
"Immediately tried on shoes when I got them, only to be disappointed! Ordered a wide width and they were still to tight, seem to run narrow. I couldn’t even tighten them, plus the shoe tongue didn’t cover up my sock, lol. It was like the shoe tongue was too small so I returned them immediately! Glad I did try on before you buy because the next day they were at UPS! Disappointed because I have Addidas golf shoes right now and they fit great! They are the same price range too.",1,0,23

These are not the shoes for a person with wide feet. I have no issues with the overall design or quality, which seem good.",2,0,23
"The shoe is narrow and is not comfortable in the heel, lacks cushion and arch support. I wore it for nine holes and doubt will wear again. Perhaps for practice, but doubt it. Definitely, a low end performance shoe, there are better shoes out there, especially for Adidas. Not sure why Adidas chose to manufacture this product other then for the price point.",2,0,23
I ordered 9 wide and the first box I received was marked as 9 wide but the shoes were just size 9. Amazon replaced them with a second pair but again the box was marked as 9 wide but the shoes themselves were just size 9. I returned them all and bought another brand from Amazon. Not Amazon's fault.,1,0,23
"You get what you pay for- at $50, these shoes were affordable, but they are also very flimsy and lightweight. They provide very little support or stability. It feels like there is nothing to them. That's good in that they are very lightweight, but bad in that they don't support your feet at all. I can feel the spikes right through the soles. Would not purchase these again.",2,0,23
These shoes were great for the first couple of months then they started to come apart on the toe. I played a lot of golf this season (over 40 rounds) and these shoes really got dirty and stained. Yes I know they are white but still I have to scrub them after almost every round of golf.,2,0,23
"The shoes look good enough but are very uncomfortable after about seven holes walking the course. The fit is good but there isn’t enough cushion in the sole and heel. I’ve worn Adidas tennis shoes since high school, fifty years ago, so I was pretty disappointed with these golf shoes.",3,0,23
"These feel fine at first, but after 4 full walking rounds my feet have REALLY hurt after each 18. I thought they'd break in and they are just painful. Additionally, they are NOT water proof at all. They don't claim to be, but they are definitely a summer shoe. Only good thing about these was the price...",3,0,23
"I was surprised by these for being adidas shoes, typically they're high quality. The seam on the outside right toe of the right shoe started failing within the first 2 months of wear. Albeit I was playing 2 rounds of golf per week, but <10 rounds of golf with the shoes before they failed?!?!? I would expect that from a bargain brand, but not from adidas. Overall they were fairly comfortable shoes but not what I expected in terms of quality.",2,0,23
"I did select a wide size 9 which is what I wear normally. I did receive a wide size 9, it indicated it was a wide shoe on the box and it was a mens version. The shoe was too narrow. My feet ( toe area) were killing me after just walking 9 holes.",2,0,23
I have already returned them. I bought them under the impression that they were a mesh shoe. I play in AZ and it’s very hot. I was looking for a full mesh upper to help with airflow. They are designed to appear as mesh but it’s just for show,3,0,23
"The moment I put these on I though, ""Not super comfortable, but they'll break in."" After 2 rounds (cart path only), I can't take it. SUPER uncomfortable! Not worth your time or money. Do not buy these. I will be contacting Adidas to voice my complaint.",1,0,23
Do not buy this shoe! Never have I had a golf shoes give me such blisters on the heel by hole # 2! All my golf shoes that I have had have the back support more or less vertical perhaps at 85-90 degrees. These shoes slant far more forward and cannot help but rub and cause serious blisters ! I have gone through many dozens of golf shoes and never have had such blisters !,1,0,23
"I own other styles of Adidas golf shoes so I was expecting a good fit. Unfortunately these were extremely narrow for me in the toe box, which is the exact opposite of what I was hoping. My toes felt like they were jammed together. Longth was fine, toe width not so much. Too bad, I think they are great shoes otherwise.",3,0,23
"All my golf shoes are 10-1/2 Wide, and fit very well. These shoes didn’t even come close to fitting, yet the were marked as 10-1/2 Wide. I noticed they were made in Vietnam, so perhaps they have different sizes there. I returned them.",1,0,23
I love the shoes except they developed a tear near the seam from normal use. Would have hoped to get more than a year out of the shoes. Very comfortable but disappointed. Not sure if this is the norm or perhaps a defect in the particular pair I received.,2,0,23
"The Adidas Men's Tech Response 4.0 Golf Shoe is a good value. Very comfortable and true to size. Shoes actually broke at the arch after just 8 months. My son bought the same shoe, and it broke down as well after just six months.",3,0,23
"These are fairly narrow, and I have a narrow foot. They do tend to stretch and are quite lite, so they still initially feel comfortable anyway, and they look great. I'm not a fan of pointy shoes like these, but I think after playing a couple rounds they will be very comfortable, and I was looking for a lite shoe. Seems to me that if you have even a little bit wide foot, you will need the W.",3,0,23
"I ordered this shoe in my normal size, and it is short. I matched it with a FootJoy in the same stated size and found the FootJoy, which fits, is longer. Now I’m stuck with a pair of golf shoes that give me blisters.",2,0,23
"The sizing of these shoes is horrible. I read the reviews and ordered accordingly. I'm typically a 10 1/2, but sometimes an 11 depending on the brand. I ordered a 10 1/2 wide and they were too short. I returned and replaced with an 11. It actually hurt to put my foot in the shoe. If you really want these, order up a size and go wide. I will not be trying a 3rd pair.",1,0,23
"It feels tight around the toes. The box is labeled wide but the label under the tongue is normal size in several other countries. If you like this shoe in wide, you may want to bump up a 1/2 size.",1,0,23
"I had to return this shoe. I was thrilled this shoe came in a wide width. The box was clearly marked 8-1/2 Wide but the shoe did not and the shoe did not fit--was way too tight. Disappointed. not sure if the box/shoe was a packaging and labeling problem or if the ""wide"" is just not what I expect from a wide !!!",3,0,23
"Fits well, lightweight, comfortable at first---- but after a couple of months wearing them, my feet hurt by the time I'm done 9 holes. Lace these up and my foot still feels like it's moving around. The inside pad feels lumpy to my feet. Can't feel it with my fingers bu8t put some weight on it and it hurts. Now I'm a big guy (240lbs) but they just feel worn out.",2,0,23
Played one season in them. Like the fit. Like the grip. They are falling apart in the outside of the toes where the shoes seam is. Not good if you play a lot and swing hard. The motion rips them apart. One season and they are going in the garbage.,3,0,23
"The box said that it was a wide, but the tags didn't indicate that at all. I don't think I was sent the correct size, and they were way too narrow for my flat foot.",2,0,23
"They offer wide width, but they are not really wide. The box is marked wide but the shoe contains no indication of a wide width and they don't fit my feet width wise. Any other 8.5w I've purchased for without issue. Other than that the shoe itself is nice, light weight, with good plastic replaceable golf spikes. Sadly I will have to return this pair.",3,0,23
Ordered a wide but it’s bottom sole is still made for narrow. Doesn’t support wide feet on sole. No cushion and support in outer areas of feet to speak of so my son complains of achy feet after an hour.,2,0,23
Shoes seemed to fit right but after playing regularly for a few weeks I got severest pain on my left 4th toes. Upon checking I noticed a very sturdy inner surface was rubbing against my toes on the follow through. No give whatsoever. Had to stop golfing for a few weeks for a while until my toe healed. I cannot wear these shoes again. Need a softer shoe.,2,0,23
"Great price for these shoes, purchased for a trip. Overall, fit is good, however the lack of waterproofing ruins the experience. After playing a couple of times in weather and early morning tee times, the shoes don't dry out easily, plus the smell is not good. Hoping they would have worked out, but will be looking for better alternative.",1,0,23
Shoes felt good but within 2 months of wearing the sole is separating from the shoe and I can no longer wear them. You feel the rubber flop around and occasionally it causes me to trip.,2,0,23
"I ordered these shoes in Feb 2019 and started using them an average of once a week. I ordered 10 W but received an 11 reg. I used them anyway, the fit was not perfect just O.K. I do not walk when playing golf so the shoes haven't received tough use. I just noticed on Monday (6-22-20) when I was cleaning them after playing golf that the sole was separating on my left shoe, bummer! I wear them an average of less than once a week and they are a little over one year old. I should think that they should last longer than that. So, buyer beware.",3,0,23
"These fit terrible. The length is fine but the area around the laces is way too low, I guess they’re are designed for the flat footed. There is absolutely no cushion inside, it’s like standing on concrete. The tie area is also a strange shape.",1,0,23
"Ordered a size 10, same as current shoes. Way too small and narrow. Could not wear same cushion socks I normally do. Good looking shoe, looks as though it would be light and airy.",2,0,23
My only negative is these can not be worn in grass that has morning dew or grass that was recently watered or your feet will be soaked. Other then that they are very comfortable and have amazing traction I will keep as my dry weather golf shoes and buy a waterproof pare as well.,3,0,23
"Wore these for 2 hours around the home before going out to golf and I’m so glad I did. Both feet had a gouge pattern and red marks all over the top of my feet.

Do not buy unless you have small feet.",2,0,23
"Had to return. Shoe looked great, light weight, but ordered a 9 1/2 wide and it wasn’t near that. If I had read more reviews I would have realized others thought the same. If you wear a medium width it’s probably a great golf shoe .",2,0,23
"I wore these golf shoes about 6 times (that's approximately 30 hours of wear) expecting them to loosen up a little. They were snug when I first put them on and expected they would conform to my feet enough to make them comfortable. They did not. I would suggest anyone ordering them to go at least one half size bigger. I re-ordered another pair one half size bigger because they were a handsome shoe, the price was right and had they fit properly they would be quite comfortable. We'll see.",3,0,23
"Nice shoe, little on heavy side, but solid construction. Soles are dangerous in my opinion, like walking on ice when concrete wet or slight incline on driveway. Why did they put cylindrical plastic inserts between sole patterns? Like the quality and construction, too dangerous to wear on concrete or when wet out!",2,0,23
"While the shoes seem very well made and were generally comfortable, they were far smaller than my other shoes of the same size. I had to send them back because they were too tight.",3,0,23
Overall its a good golf shoe but it's only good at $69 anymore and I wouldn't rate it this high.,3,0,23
Bought this shoe about one year ago for golf. Only play about once per week so I have worn these shoes maybe 40 times. The rubber cleats on the bottom are still not worn out. Today while playing golf the freakin bottom of the shoe fell off! These shoes are a joke. I guess you get what you pay for. I take care of my gear. These shoes have not been abused.,1,0,23
I am not sure if it is water resistant since I returned it. It’s a good looking and seems to be well made but not fitting as a golf shoes.,3,0,23
Ordered and received shoes labelled 9 1/2 US Men's but could barely get my feet into them. They were AT LEAST one full size too small. Both box and shoes labels said 9 1/2 Medium. They looked great but I had to return them.,3,0,23
very difficul to get shoes on,1,0,23
This is a lightweight and comfortable shoe. It is not waterproof so you will need to do that with Scotchguard or something like that. The inside of the heel wore out and and fell apart in about 6-8 months.,3,0,23
"Box said wide, shoe did not. These are quite narrow. There is no top down view offered...the toe on the size 11 ordered was very pointed, like a women’s shoe or fancy dress shoes...looked quite odd for an athletic shoe! The toe of my foot joy saddle shoes were way more rounded than these!",3,0,23
"Bought these for my Hubby. Happy to find him a wide shoe. The box says wide, but if you look at the tag on the shoe it clearly says ""D"". So... tried another pair to find the same problem: box says wide - shoe says ""D""! Returning them both. Don't buy if you really need a wide shoe!!!!!",1,0,23
I ordered the size that every shoe I wear is and these are way too tight. I can barely get them on with socks. I don’t like them.,3,0,23
"Yes these wear small. I found them to narrow to wear, length was consistent with my running shoes however. otherwise they would have been great.",3,0,23
Nice shoes but way too narrow if you have a wide foot. I ordered in wide width but no way are these a typical wide shoe.,1,0,23
"I was excited to purchase these for my husband at a great price as it can be hard to find decent looking wide shoes at such a low cost. We received the shoes, the order said wide, the box said wide but the shoes were normal width as that’s what their label stated and my husband’s foot proved. Not sure how it happened but feeling duped. Ended up having to purchase some Nike golf shoes that were actually wide fit and a bit more costly.",3,0,23
Product it's not water resistant for when I play golf if I encounter any water on Golf Course,3,0,23
these shoes were purchased assuming the 9 1/2 wide size would work. They are not as wide as I would have hoped and I have some toe pinching. Hopefully they will stretch a bit so I can wear them for 18 holes instead on 9 holes which is the limit without too much toe pain due to the narrow width.,3,0,23
"Shoe looks good.
Soles are comfortable.
I don't have wide feet but went with the wide size based on other reviewers (Thank you).
Wore it for the first time today and backs of both ankles are blistered.
Breaking in is going to be a painful process.",3,0,23
Shoes aren’t bad for the price but are very stiff and the high back digs into the back of my ankle. Not terrible for a round but def could be more comfortable. Grips well,3,0,23
Dont get the white. It literally is ruined the first outing. The mesh cannot be cleaned properly and gets really dirty looking. Black is a great shoe.,1,0,23
Most painful shoe I've ever worn. I have a blister on each foot form a short round on a 9 hole course. When you first try them on they feel great. It was about 45 mins into my round that it started. I could barely walk. They rub the back of my foot with every step. The worst thing is I bought them right before they closed all the courses so now that I have had a chance to use them its too late to return them. Bummer.,1,0,23
Shoe is light and breaths but mesh looks very dirty after a few trips to the sand trap. Cant really get them clean. My buddy has the same shoe and it looks bad too. Im embarrased to wear them after 1 season so tossing them in the trash.,2,0,23
"Son muy cómodos. Sin embargo, los tenis no están diseñados para una larga duración pues tienen una especie de tela que se rompe con facilidad al momento de limpiarlos.

El producto no parece tener la calidad esperada pues los tenis no tienen la durabilidad requerida para este tipo de productos. a los 6 meses se rompió la tela gris superior y parece no haber opciones para reclamar por garantía.",1,0,23
Good stability and wet protection but I could feel the molded cleats against my feet not enough padding,2,0,23
"They would be nice if they fit nicely, but unfortunately anyone with wide feet will not like the fit.",2,0,23
"I got these as a gift for my dad, they were about a 1/2 size to small. He normally wears a 10.5 but he needed an 11 in this shoe.",2,0,23
"The most comfortable golf shoe ??? No they are not, I have played 4 rounds with these, my feet are in pain after 6 holes. I had to add a real shoe cushion the standard is hard as a rock. Never will buy again.",1,0,23
"I ordered the 12W and they are snug and do not seem to be a true 'Wide'
Still wearable and somewhat comfy wearing them around the house to break them in some.

I think the Adidas BOA are a better shoe / better price and run true to sizing",3,0,23
the shoe fits well and is nice for dry weather. The back of it extends up fairly high and will take a couple wearing to break in. If you don't wear tall enough socks it will rub a blister on the back of your heel.,3,0,23
The soles are too hard. I discarded the insoles that came with the shoes. Didn't provide enough cushion. I purchased 2 sets of Dr Shoals at $9.00 each and in order to walk without discomfort. I won't buy this product again.,3,0,23
"Nice shoe, but not good for walking 18 hurts my feet a lot. For some people might not be an issue.",2,0,23
Like the shoes...fits good and really comfortable but as you can see...I received them with a missing cleat...wtf??!!,3,0,23
"My foot is between normal and wide
and I ordered the wide version as others stated the shoe runs on the narrow side.
The wide was more like a narrow shoe,
had to return as was very tight and also on the short side too.",2,0,23
"They ran very small.... disliked sizing. I’ve realized if a product is economical, it usually runs tight or small.",2,0,23
"Haven't worn them on the course yet. She was a little narrow for being listed as a ""Wide"". I'm hoping they will stretch a little. Better fitting than Nikes.",3,0,23
"I ordered wide because I know they run narrow, these shoes are not wide and the size is at least a 1/2 size too small, I will give the shoes to someone who wears an 11. Maybe if they were made in America they would fit American men!",2,0,23
"Shoe was nice but way to small. Advised new buyer to order at the very least, one full size larger. Amazon was great about taking them back and exchanging for a larger size. Thanks Amazon!!!",3,0,23
"Just tried the shoe on, way too narrow. Even though I bought it in January, can I return it for a wider version. Broke leg so I never used it until I tried it on this week....Help It would be helpful if you would respond. All I want to do is exchange for proper size and I have received no response after 5 requests. I guess you don't stand behind anything. Will copy this letter to executive dept and Ct office of consumer protection...George Finley",2,0,23
Great shoes but the way they are manufactured creates a cleaning problem. The mesh material on top of the shoe is overlayed on a material that stains and cannot be cleaned. There is a brown stain on both shoes that cannot be removed. I would not recommend buying these shoes and if there were a way to return them or get a refund that would be great since they are not wearable. Rricci@charter.net.,1,0,23
In my option the shoe photographs fine but it has a Very narrow toe box when I wore them. I had to spend the extra money and get the True Brand golf shoe.,2,0,23
Bought 1/2 size larger and fit ok but noticed shoes have a much narrower than my foot joys. Feet do get wet even in heavy dew. All in all shoes are ok for the money but don't think they will last as long as foot joys.,3,0,23
I ordered size 12 which normally fits loosely but was uncomfortably tight in the toes with this shoe.,3,0,23
"I purchased these Addidas golf shoes to replace a pair that had given me several years of good service and fit perfectly. Unfortunately, although I purchased the same size and model these are too small. I don't like to return item but I guess this teaches me to ALWAYS go to a store and try on shoes before purchase",1,0,23
"Bought these because the price was right and looked like the running shoes I normally wear when golfing. Normally wear an 11 and since most reviews said the size was ok, I ordered an 11. The fit is a little tight in the forefoot and a little stiff, but hopefully they'll stretch out as I wear them more. Not as comfortable as my running shoes but since I got these on sale $60, the price was right.",3,0,23
I wore this shoe once and it was so uncomfortable I will not be wearing it again. Anyone need a poor quality golf show in an 8 1/2? Barely used.,2,0,23
