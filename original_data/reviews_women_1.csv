So I won't lie I'm a big girl and I weigh roughly 350 lbs and I am on my feet all day at work and I got these because everyday my back is killing me and after wearing these while working it is the first time that I wasn't hobbling out to my car after my shift,5,1,5
" Super cute! I really love these shoes! They are comfortable and they can be worn pretty much anywhere! The fit is perfect!! The pink color, is a deep rich pink! These are my new favorite shoes!!! I‚Äôm really excited to wear them around!",5,1,5
"I had worn out Adidas that needed replacement. I was weary of getting a brand I was unfamiliar with, but I loved the design. They are perfect! I can do 6 miles and my feet are good and better yet they hold my ankle well. I didn‚Äôt realize how my feet were twisting/moving too much in my Adidas shoes that were way too wide. I have better support and they look like high end sneakers. My brother spends $100 and up on sneakers and he was impressed. -Heather",5,1,5
These athletic shoes were a pleasant surprise! Love how vibrant the colors are and how nice the fit is. I would say they are true to size and really comfy too!,5,1,5
"So I ordered the purple ones and I got pink, but honestly I‚Äôve decided I like the pink ones better anyways and also these are the most comfortable running shoes I‚Äôve had in YEARS! The minute I put them on it was like walking on a cloud. I can‚Äôt wait to wear these in the gym! I just took my dogs for a walk in them and usually my back hurts a lot when I walk both dogs (I have two) but these shoes made it much less painful for me and my back issues. If you‚Äôre looking for new gym shoes or just walking in general, get a pair of these!!",5,1,5
Great shoe. I needed a good running shoe & these r comfortable & I live the black & white. Look cute,5,1,5
"After reading the reviews . I thought I‚Äôd give this shoe s a try . I normally wear Nike .I‚Äôve only had them for a few days I wanted to make sure they were going to work I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm keeping them or not I like the way they look, but after having them on for a few hours my left foot hurts .It could be just me . I have experience this with any other shoe .I don‚Äôt think I could wear these gym shoes more then a few hours",5,1,5
"Comfortable and affordable. Fits great and has nice air flow.

Update 2 months later shoes literally broke in half!

I did contact seller and they did compromise with me and a refund not full $ back but it's not their fault it's the manufacturer. But I was pleased they cared enough to work with me.",1,0,5
Very comfortable for any type of workout. I like how my feet look in them- very sleek.,5,1,5
"I purchased these for walking/jogging but didn't realize they were not Air Max even though they looked awfully close. The comfort is not good & the shoes left a bruise on my skin underneath the tongues just from walking. They fit snug even though I ordered a larger size than I wear. Needless to say, I was disappointed but not going to waste time trying to return them. These are pretty much Bo Bo's.",1,0,5
"Overall, gorgeous color and great quality. Can hardly tell the difference in comfort between these and Under Armour or Nike - right out of the box. I think this shoe runs a little small however so if you have a wider feet, the narrow toe probably won't work for you. I was really impressed with the comfort level and arch support for this price. There were two main reasons why I returned these. 1) narrow toe bed rubbed too much 2) puffy heal piece felt like it may get uncomfortable. I have a shoe now with a very thin heal support and I'm not used to a thicker one.",3,0,5
"These shoes look just like the photos. They came nicely packaged. They are very lightweight. The only thing I don‚Äôt care for about them is that they are very pointy and narrow through the toe area. If you have any toe problems or like a little room for your toes to be able to move, these are not the shoes for you. I wore them to work and couldn‚Äôt wait to take them off when I got home. I haven‚Äôt worn them since. And in my opinion because they are so narrow and pointy the made my feet look a lot bigger üôÅ",3,0,5
"I searched Nike Air and this was included in the products that were listed. As it stated ""Air"" I did not fully see that it was not a Nike product. When I received the shoes they were a bit on the large side but being that they were running shoes, I thought I just needed the extra room for my toes. Unfortunately, I tried running the treadmill in these three times. Each time, the ball on my right foot would ache after wearing them. Furthermore Nike was no where listed on the shoe. I went back to my Amazon order and sure enough they were not made by Nike. Sure they are eye catching. They're pretty and as long as you're really not trying to exercise in them, they're probably alright. I noticed that after working out with them three times the rubber off the bottom started to wear and come off. These are really cheap tennis shoes. They hurt my feet and I've returned them in hopes of a refund. I feel misled.",1,0,5
"I really wanted to love these. They are super cute, but that's all they got going for them. I was excited based on other reviews. I tried these out going shopping.
My feet hurt more than they have in a long time and i have plantar fasciitis. I have bad ankles and they ached. My low back pain (degenerative disc disorder, arthritis and scoliosis) is already enough, these shoes were TERRIBLE!. i bought some new inserts and instantly they were better. There's no cushion. No give, i think a pizza box has more cushion. I included pics of the shoe insoles. If I'm going to pay extra just to make them tolerable is not worth it.

On another note the tongue seems extra long and is a bit annoying.",1,0,5
Love these shoes!!! So cushiony and comfortable and they look cute. Don‚Äôt hurt my feet. Highly recommend.,5,1,5
When I ordered them I ordered a size 9. They sent me a 9.5. The 9.5 barely fit. They do not run true to their size. They are a small shoe. Plus when tying the shoe you have to hold the tongue of the shoe in place other wise it does not stay in place. They are a pretty shoe and some what comfortable but I wouldn't get then again. To much of a hassle,3,0,5
"I have had these shoes two months and found out today they have multiple cracks along the bottom. Shortly after I got them, I had to walk in the rain and noticed my feet got soaked. I wrote it off as a heavy rain, so didn't check the bottoms of the shoes. It's been fairly dry lately, so I didn't question the two times my feet got soaked until today when I was walking in a sprinkling rain and my feet again got soaked, so I checked the bottoms of the shoes and sure enough, they have multiple horizontal cracks in the bottoms.
They are beautiful shoes. I got compliments several times a week on how good they look. They were very comfortable (as long as the weather was dry). They dry out quickly when they get wet, but unfortunately my socks do not. Good looks doesn't do it for me, it's merely a small reason for the shoes I buy. I'm practical in my shoe purchases and have different expectations for different shoes. I expect my work shoes to only last six months because my job is insane and the work is hard on them. I expect my sneakers to last at least one year, usually they last at least two years because they are only worn to and from work and on errands. So these sneakers were a major disappointment. Two months is a waste of my money.",1,0,5
They have decent grip and are supportive and comfortable over all. But the toes are pretty narrow. I would recommend going at least a half a size up. If you have wide feet I might go a full size up.,3,0,5
Beautiful shoes. So comfortable. Unfortunately my daughter has only had them for 3 months. She is on her feet most of the day for her job. What a shame that these are just about completely broken in half!! I am really disappointed!!,1,0,5
"I am an In-home Caregiver. These shoes are the only shoes I have found that keep up with me. That is above Sketchers, Ryka and Reebok. I have all three.
My feet don't ache, they don't sweat and these shoes are quiet. I'll keep buying these. I also bought a pair for my daughter and will buy a pair for my husband. He works in a nursing home. Good shoes are so important. I'm very pleased with these! The price is even better! No more $100 shoes that don't help!",5,1,5
"I have ordered a lot of gym shoes, as I teach fitness classes, and I am always looking for a good shoe. I will not spend a lot of money due to the frequency of needing new ones so often. I have been pleased with this shoe! I must say I purchased for the look, which I like and for the price, not expecting the shoe to be as supportive as it was. Probably the best I‚Äôve had in a long time! I waited to do the review to see if it was a ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù fit, but so far (a month in) they still feel good on my feet. I have not even added heel strikes to them, as I often do.",5,1,5
"I am having a problem with numb toes and slight pain behind the toes which doesn't bother me too much, but I think I also broke a bone in my foot which is sore enough to keep me from covering the whole grocery store when shopping. None of my Nikes or sandals are comfortable. The only shoes that were less painful were my Croc Freesails which they don't make anymore and my Teva sandal clodhoppers.

When I saw these I decided to try a pair. I must have had a screw loose that day because I bought the white shoes which will get dirty fast! However, the color doesn't matter because these shoes seem to be fixing my feet. I can wear them all day and when I take them off at night my feet feel better than they did in the morning.

Now these shoes have substantial fabric and substantial weight. I weighed ONE of my new Gannou size 9.5's and it weighed 12.75 ounces. My Nike Air Pegasus weighs 9.25 ounces. So, not light--more like hiking boots.

The only thing I don't like is that the tongue is very long and sticks up if I don't use the top shoelace hole which is very high and just too much for me to use. That is very minor and I don't care because these shoes have so many pluses.

These shoes have a nice wide and long toe box which is perfect for me. My actual size is 9.5 and these fit beautifully with a nice thick sole.

I am so happy with them I bought a darker pair. I just hope the sizing is consistent.",5,1,5
"About me:

‚Ä¢ Normally wears a size 11 in my favorite brand of running shoes (Nike Winflow 6) which leaves me with a small thumb-size of wiggle room, so I purchased these in an 11 and they are the same size (actually the Nike‚Äôs seem a 1/4 inch or so longer). Amazon recommended that I buy them in a 10 because I wear a size 10 in NON-running shoes, so be careful with that.

‚Ä¢ I overpronate when I run

‚Ä¢ I run about 1-2 miles, 2-3 times per week and walk an additional 2-4 miles throughout the week for exercise

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôve been running for years and have tried several brands of shoes

About the shoes following my first run:

‚Ä¢ Fit- as expected
‚Ä¢ Comfort rating- 5/5 (straight out of the bag & during the 1st run)
‚Ä¢ Visual appeal- as expected
‚Ä¢ Over-pronation Support- 4/5

Cons: the lip seems a bit long and the shoes do feel a little less sturdy than what I‚Äôm used to, but this didn‚Äôt affect my run at all. I do not expect these shoes to last as long as my usual shoes do (I anticipate that they‚Äôll need to be replaced after about 4 months).

Overall, these are a steal for their price, as my preferred shoe can cost $80+ Per pair. I‚Äôve already ordered a second pair.",5,1,5
I work as an ER nurse and I need new shoes every year since I work three 12 hour shifts every week (sometimes more). I've bought shoes from amazon before and was disappointed but during the COVID times I decided to try again and I was very impressed with how these shoes felt and looked!! I haven't worn them at work because I'll need to throw away my shoes once COVID gets cleared but I've worn them around and I love them so far!,5,1,5
I like the way they look ... but unfortunately I had to cancel my order because I read it wrong I thought they were Nike sneakers but I love the way they look and I love the color of them but I got to have Nike On My Feet!!..sorry,1,0,5
"I bought these shoes as they came up highly recommended, when I was searching for a replacement for my go-to daily ""work"" sneakers. (Insert name brand SWOOSH symbol athletic sneakers...)
I work primarily on my feet, roughly 60 hr work weeks between primary job and home life of having four dogs.
Yes, I considered the price difference could reflect quality. I did NOT expect these shoes to start failing me after a month.

If you need these for occasional walking or day trips- they are great. No break in period needed.

But if you want them to stand up to regular wear and tear from daily, all day use? Pay the higher price. You get what you pay for sometimes.",2,0,5
I actually accidentally got these shoes thinking they were Nikes :-D needless to say Nike is Nike for a reason. These shoes are very flimsy.,1,0,5
"If you are looking for shoes that can handle physical activities that are more than a leisurely walk, DO NOT buy these! I made it 15 minutes into a HIIT workout before I had to take them off and finish the rest with just socks on; having no support genuinely was better than the pain these caused in that short of time. These are totally for fashion, not at all for function.",1,0,5
I will never pay over a hundred dollars for sneakers ever again. üòò I'm in love ‚ù§Ô∏è,5,1,5
"These feel great. They appear to be Nike rip-offs, but what I care about most is the comfort and I can get away with wearing them at work. I can't find Nikes like this anyway with the air pocket bubble under the heel. I wish the tongue label wasn't there or I would have given 5 stars. The tongue label makes them look cheap. They are cheap though. In any case, they're comfortable.",4,1,5
The shoe is stiff & a bit inflexible to put on with regards to the ankle area. After walking in them for more than an hour my heels are sore. Definitely not good for wearing for long periods of time or high impact running/sports/work outs. Would not purchase this brand again in the future.,3,0,5
"Bought these thinking they were a specific brand and was happy to find out they are a nice fit sneaker. The air pockets in the back give more support to the ankle in my opinion and the mesh like material around the rest of the sneaker fits snuggly to your foot. However, I feel that the quality is a bit off outside of shoe towards the edging feels a bit cheaply made.

Trying for the first time today",4,1,5
"I bought these shoes finally after two times wearing, I decide to wear these to a football game at the sofi stadium, sure did I wear Socks with them , yeah, did I buy them in my exact size yes, did my heal occasionally flip out sure, just tie them tighter.
After the game we pulled over at a restaurant mid 6pm at night while families were walking up for their Sunday dinner, as I was Walking up my heal flew out of the left shoe and as I tried to catch myself my right shoe decide to give out, both feet flew out of my shoes I landed Face first into the cement busting my lip which I just Had done. I was Left with busted lip and small chip in my tooth. Maybe I should have gotten smaller size or no socks since they were that sock material already?",2,0,5
"Was trying to get shoes for work that were not too expensive because I work around a bunch of veterinary type cleaning chemicals and that usually kills shoes. These so far have lasted a few months no holes yet, and are comfortable. My last relatively cheap pair I bought lasted two weeks so much better. We recently got in some snow and these don't have a lot of warmth or barrier from the cold so wear extra socks then. Fit is normal.",5,1,5
I'd recommend ordering a half size down. I wear a 9 and ordered a 9. They're too long. Look like boats!! They're comfy on my heel area.,4,1,5
"Not bad at all! My daughter bought them for me for Christmas. I was so happy they're actually rubber at the bottom and not foam! They fit true to size and are comfortable. You could add insoles for extra comfort but that's for any shoe. Also they give good stable height without the bulk. For shorter people like myself it was a plus.
UPDATE:
AFTER ONE MONTH! SHOE LACES LOOP HOLES CRACKED ON BOTH SHOES! Around the holes where the shoe laces go through it's made of plastic. I was tying my shoes and noticed they had cracked down at the lowest loop holes. Greatly disappointed but I'm still wearing them didn't want to hurt my daughter's feelings.",4,1,5
"These shoes came at least two sizes too large. I had to return them, but didn‚Äôt like them enough to repurchase smaller size. I also didn‚Äôt want to guess what size I should order so it‚Äôll fit me. Even if I did have giant feet, the shoes are way too soft and flimsy. Maybe good if you want to wear them to take a short walk to the supermarket, but cannot recommend them for anything else. They basically have zero support.",2,0,5
I really like these Sneakers and you can't beat the Price. I have had them a month now and Wear them to do Cardio Daily. (Elliptical) They are Comfortable and allow enough Toe Space for my wide feet. I did put Thin Dr. Scholl Gel Inserts in them for a little extra Cushion. If you are looking for Arch Support these are not the Sneaker for you but they are very Comfortable to me. And I have gotten compliments on the Style.,5,1,5
"I never have any luck when ordering shoes or clothes online, but took a chance when I saw these shoes, looove the color so vibrate purple.
So comfortable (little snug in the beginning but will loosen when being worn) they are true to size i am a 9 1/2 and they fit perfect. I‚Äôm going to order the peach and black once as well. First day of wearing them I got compliments, and my friend loved them as much as me and ordered herself the same shoes that night.",5,1,5
"Overall, I like the look of the shoe. While it is comfortable and lightweight, I don‚Äôt care for the material on the inside of the shoe. It‚Äôs slick and my foot is constantly sliding around every step I take, especially on a downward incline - it slides forward on each step. I took a 2.5 mile walk today and did some other minimal walking throughout the day and my feet HURT. I don‚Äôt remember them feeling this way in my other shoes (Nikes). I ordered the same size I normally get in other brands.",3,0,5
I was fooled by the product description and ratings. I bought these to wear to my job as a restaurant manager and I almost fell down every few minutes. The soles are made of a very hard plastic so they also become really uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. I had to leave work to go change shoes because I could not have made it through the day in these death traps.,1,0,5
"Hands down THE BEST purchase I've made on Amazon. This shoe is everything it was described as. It is sized perfectly! I haven't had the best results with clothing or shoes turning out as described or what you see in the picture on Amazon, but, THIS WAS PERFECT. I highly recommend purchasing these shoes. I will buy more again in the future. I wish all Amazon purchases could be this perfect.",5,1,5
"Won't know how good they are until a few weeks, but from the try on point of view, perfect fit & comfortable....I usually only wear ASICS but they are becoming not comfortable....these are 100% better from a first impression stand point....time will tell on the supportive side. Plus they're true to size. I purchased 7.5",5,1,5
"Adorable, BUT poor quality. I bought them for my 11 year old daughter and she wore them to school every day However, as cute as they are, her entire right sole started peeling up and and completely Ripped off within 6 weeks. They may be fine for working out and maybe only wearing them at a gym for an hour, but I definitely do not recommend daily usage. They are simply not well made, and I‚Äôve seen this in other posts as well.",2,0,5
Okay so does she looks nice it feels like if it was the right size it will be comfortable however I asked for a size 10 I don't know what I got I'm guessing is a size 9 however one of my feet are tighter than the other foot they squeeze too tight it supposed to be wide as well they're too small this is not a 10 I do know my shoe size,5,1,5
"Being a fitness instructor, I thought I would purchase a pair of these shoes because they looked like they had good support inside and out and would be comfortable to jump around in. Sadly, they are not. The insoles have no cushion to them, I felt like I was working out without shoes on. My feet were in a lot of pain. So, I‚Äôm just going to use them for everyday use. I got what a paid for, but looks like I‚Äôll have to spend a little more for comfort : / Oh well, lesson learned.",1,0,5
"Had these shoes a few weeks now, because I needed something better for standing all day at work. Definitely recommend. Gotten lots of compliments too. I usually wear a 9.5 wide and sized up to a 10 and it's perfect. Only problem is the white accent above heal is starting to crack on both sides.",4,1,5
I love love love These! Every athletic type shoe I've got on Amazon- I've loved. These have some weight to them but not a lot. They have a mesh front and it's easy to move in. The colors are cute. I will buy other colors in the future. Also- when delivered they come In a clear sack. Not a box so one shoe was bent for a good minute where the ankle is.,5,1,5
I returned the order and asked for a refund! I received a second pair of shoes instead of my request for a refund! The left shoe caused pain to my ankle. The product was stiff and not bendable as described in the add. I am returning the second pair of shoes and hope to receive my refund.,1,0,5
Comfortable sneaker however the second day I wore them the bottom rubber by the heal on both sneakers started to loosen. Unfortunately i had to use some supper glue to glue back the heals and it‚Äôs noticeable. I would have preferred to not have to even had to do it. Other than that they are comfortable. Just be prepared to glue them,2,0,5
These are an okay shoe. I've already rolled my ankle twice on the first day. They're heavy and not very flexible. Feels like I can get the stretchy fabric tight enough without it pressing into the top of my foot.,1,0,5
"These sneakers are so pretty! Literally every time I wore them I would get compliments on them. However, after about six weeks the foam totally wore out and it felt like I was wearing thin flip flops on concrete everywhere I walked. So, all in all, it wasn‚Äôt a worthwhile purchase. I can‚Äôt even wear them anymore.",5,1,5
"Although the shoes looked really cute, they were very very uncomfortable on my feet. I gave them away and I‚Äôm not sure if anyone ever wore them.",2,0,5
Didn't notice they werent real Nike till the delivery notification. I am on my feet running around at work for 8 hours and wanted to cry after wearing them. Mind you I broke them in before that! Not enough cushion if you're constantly on your feet,1,0,5
Thought these were NIKE sneakers and are not. They are uncomfortable and painful to walk in. They are very stiff sneakers and working out is impossible. Very disappointed- guess I should have read all of the fine print but the way they‚Äôre pictured makes you believe they‚Äôre Nike air .,1,0,5
"I am a nurse so I am on my feet for 12+ hours. I went off the reviews and decided to give these shoes a try! I do not like these shoes at all! My feet are killing me before half of my shift and I need something that doesn‚Äôt kill my feet! I tried to contact the seller but have still heard nothing back. I wish I would have kept my $40 and put it toward a pair of brooks, asics or nikes !!!!",3,0,5
I am so surprised how much comfort these offer. They cost only a fraction of name brand shoes and offer. They are cute too. I purchased a few different colors and I am glad that I have. Don't sleep on the comfort that these have to offer. I am not disappointed about purchasing these lamps,4,1,5
"I love the shoes, they are really comfortable however, I they gave me the wrong size. I had orginally ordered an 8 which didn't fit (inside said 7.5-8. I decided to go ahead and order an 8 1/2 and will return the other ones later. My new ones just arrived and I am disappointed because they say 7.5-8 not 8 1/2 as I ordered. Now I have two pairs of the same size that I can't wear. I don't know what I am going to do about returning them because I don't want to leave the house due to the CA lockdown but that was a lot of money wasted....",3,0,5
Not gonna lie have actually worn these out as yet because I want to keep these in good condition. Love my little knockoffs w their support and appeal. I just hope the stand the test of time (looks like it though).,5,1,5
So for me it doesn't fit I have wide feet and I seen other reviews that said they have wide feet and it fit but for me it didn't maybe if I went a half a size up but my shoe size is a 6 and a half to 7 so I got a 7 but it's just not wide enough for my feet so if you have wide feet they may not be for you,2,0,5
Shoes run too big. Also the most uncomfortable shoe I have ever worn! Wish I had not worn the one pair out of the two purchased or both would go back! One did get returned. No thanks!,1,0,5
"I didn‚Äôt realize these were knock off Nikes when I bought them. I was a little disappointed when I opened them, but let me tell you, they way exceeded my expectations! So comfy and perfect for running! They‚Äôre my every day gym shoes now and I‚Äôm going to get another pair! Very cute and good quality!",5,1,5
"Lots & lots of compliments!

These shoes were purchased for a quick trip to NYC where we planned to do a lot of walking.

I have a history of lower back pain after walking a distance. With these shoes, I experienced NO PAIN after a day walking around The Big Apple.

I‚Äôm going to buy more colors so I can hit the street in style AND comfort!",5,1,5
"Amazon wins again!!! So much comfort and versatile and super cute!!

I read a previous review to size up, and personally for me I needed to size down: returned and refunded super easily! I‚Äôm naturally an 8 1/2 and ordered a 9 originally and too large, ordered the 8 and they‚Äôre perfect !",5,1,5
"I'll be returning these, I was looking for new running shoes that weren't going to cost me to much. I was excited when I found these shoes, and even got more excited when I read the reviews on how they were true to size. I received the shoes and put them on immediately only to realize that they had extra space around the ankle making them feel loose :(
The shoe fit nicely except the ankle area. Sad day, my search for the right shoe continues.",2,0,5
"My sister & I both bought a pair of these for the gym, & we love them. I wear them all the time because of how comfortable they are. I usually wear an 8. I ordered an 8 1/2 & they are a little loose, but I don't like them super tight. Definitely recommend!",5,1,5
Just opened my box and they are navy and pink instead of black and pink. No where on the description did it say it was navy and all pictures looks black. I'll update review later on fit but that's not what I care about right now.,3,0,5
These sneakers are very comfortable. I work 12 hour shifts and my feet feel great in these shoes. The price was good and they look good with my uniform.,5,1,5
I'm pregnant and I'm usually a size 6.5 but my feet swell so I got a 7. My walmart pair are way more comfortable. Rewriting my review because they were comfy at first but the more I wear them the less comfy they are.,3,0,5
These sneakers are fantastic. They are so cute. They fit well and give support AND they were super inexpensive! I was worried since they weren‚Äôt name brand but not any problems so far. Love them,5,1,5
"I'm actively excited to put them on in the morning, which sounds dorky but I'm a dork. I've been looking for shoes with good support because I've been having foot pain and they help a lot. They're super comfortable and fit very well. I absolutely recommend them!!",5,1,5
Shoes fit very well. Very comfortable. Great for walking on concrete floors but the tongue of both shoes shift to the side since there is no band to put the laces thru to hold it in place. Meaning you have to stop and adjust them every so often.,5,1,5
Very comfortable for working a 10 hour shift on your feet.,4,1,5
"I love that these just slip on, but they are kind of ‚Äòwobbly‚Äô. As in, the sides are not super sturdy so my foot sometimes rolls off the sole, almost causing me to roll my ankle. Definitely not a shoe to work out in, but for just a slip on and go, I love them!",4,1,5
I ordered them because I thought they were Nikes,1,0,5
They are cute and functional for daily use. I don‚Äôt use them for working out. The only thing I wish they had was a slip strap on the tongue to hold the tongue in the center of the shoe.I find the tongue sliding to the side throughout the day and needs to be readjusted.,4,1,5
"I ordered from the size chart US 7.5. Too big, no arch support, not that comfortable could walk in them much less run bcz they came right off my feet not happy won't be ordering any more from this company",1,0,5
"I like to run, but I‚Äôm tired of buying Nike - they get so run down so quickly (see what I did there?) and lose support and I‚Äôll get injured pretty quickly. These shoes are half the price, and so far they are far more comfortable! I have arch support, cushioning in the heels, and there‚Äôs even a little bit of bounce in the toes. It also helps that they‚Äôre cute as heck. I may have to order a second pair just for another color! I got the white and light blue.",4,1,5
"These are super cute and very sporty, very comfortable for short times. However they are super flat, I ended up having foot pain by the end of the night. I climb stairs all day at work and these aren‚Äôt that good for work when you‚Äôre on your feet all day",4,1,5
Dangerous! These shoes are super cute and fit perfectly but no matter what socks I wear my feet slide around in them like they‚Äôre massive. I bought these for a trips to Missouri for hiking and literally had my foot slide/flip sideways in the shoe ‚Ä¶. Not fun and painful ‚Ä¶ I almost broke my ankles a couple of times. Very unfortunate since they‚Äôre cute but not worth the possible injury.,2,0,5
"It was not disclosed in the ad that this product is manufactured in china! had I known that, two different scenarios would have occurred. one I would have known that the shoes were going to be too small regardless because China cannot accommodate a wide width foot even if you give them handwritten instructions . Secondly, I would never have ordered a product that was manufactured in China !!! failure to disclose this manufacturing anomaly has shown me that I will have to do much better research before choosing to do business with Amazon anymore.",3,0,5
"I didn‚Äôt read the description, so I thought these were Nike, no instep support.",1,0,5
With an air cushion in the heel I was expecting it to be a light weight shoe. It is not.,3,0,5
"Fit as expected.
Support seemed fair
However insides outside areas seem to lack support.
Just did not feel right on the feet for running.
I returned them",2,0,5
"Very Comfortable. Arrived a day earlier. Tiny bit snug. So if you are deciding between a 7 or 7.5, I think take the 7.5
Update Sept. 14. These shoes have a way of pulling your socks ( ankle) down in the shoes. It bothers me. It may not bother you",5,1,5
"The back of the heel is a little high but if your used to that the shoes are great. They are comfortable, breathable, and cute great for the summer.",5,1,5
"Overall, these are great but I usually wear a size 6 shoe & I had to wear a size 7 1/2 in these.
They are very comfortable!",4,1,5
"The shoes had a nice look and feel to them, unfortunately they were too small for my daughter.",3,0,5
"I would not buy them if you work in areas where a floor could be wet.
So basically they are good for walking and exercising if you will not be around any moisture on tile or hard floors.",3,0,5
"Comfort felt like they would good.
However they are a narrow fit even after up sizing, and wouldn't be good for standing or walking all day.
Unfortunately I am returning them",5,1,5
Left shoe is great but the right one for ones I received hurt top of my foot for some reason so I tried everything including thin socks so I have to kind of deal with it cuz I can't afford to get another pair. Snug so maybe size up half size if possible,3,0,5
I bought these for work. Loved how they look. Unfortunately they really hurt the top of my feet. I have to take them off for a bit during the workday a couple times. Glad I sit at a desk most of the day.,2,0,5
"Beautiful colors but... extremely huge and feels heavy. Not for running. Really wanted to love these but I was looking for a lighter, more fitted running shoes. Have to return these..",2,0,5
The white lining along the soles are already cracking. I've only had them for two weeks.,3,0,5
I always wear nike. But seen these and was a little worried to order them for the price. But i was fooled!!!!! I will be ordering more of these and less of nike at this point. They are so comfortable wearing and honestly resembles to look of a nike. SO WORTH THE MONEY SPENT,5,1,5
"I usually wear size 11 but 10 1/2 fit well. I actually thought I was ordering Nike air at first but when I realized they weren‚Äôt, I thought I would give them a try. I work in mobile home manufacturing and am on my feet, in and out of houses, up and down steps- first day I wore them was the last. Probably ok to just walk around doing whatever but not for work. Disappointed I wasted my money.",1,0,5
Love the color!! Fits great...had to get good shoes for my new job and these are prefect..would totally buy them again..,5,1,5
"I was surprised just how cute, comfy and lightweight these shoes really are. I find they are about a half size too big, but still wearable with socks. Everyone said size up, but I‚Äôm not sure I would. Overall can‚Äôt beat the price!",4,1,5
"This pair of shoes came cery quickly. They arrived exactly as pictured and described online. The fit is exact, so order you normal size. They are stylish, very cute and comfortable! Perfect for running or simply every day wear, and they are super affordable! I highly recommend these shoes! I absolutely LOVE mine!",5,1,5
Appears on searches for Under Armour.. cheap Chinese knockoff,1,0,5
"Really love these shoes. Comfortable to wear, walk in and care for. Light weight and no thick soles. I would purchase again.",5,1,5
You get what you pay for with these sneakers. I just wore them out on a walk with my dog. I walked for about 20 minutes. Once I got home my feet were so sore. There is no coushin in the shoes.,3,0,5
"Fit is TTS. Comfortable, I am an RN and I bought these for work. I‚Äôve worn them almost every shift since purchasing. I get a lot of compliments on them as well.",4,1,5
"I added an insole to both sneakers because I require more arch support. Great for the price.
The shoe strings do not loosen and tightened as easily as my more expensive shoes but overall good shoe for price.",5,1,5
"I received these in February and loved how comfortable they were. I‚Äôm on my feet all day and they did the job. It‚Äôs only April and some how both shoes split in the middle . I‚Äôm assuming poor get together because I literally stand in one spot so it was nothing I did. I need a pair of shoes that will last me, these aren‚Äôt it unfortunately.",1,0,5
"These shoes are my favorite brand. This is my second purchase. They support your feet really well and they are very comfortable. I would've given them five stars, but they are very slippery at times if it is wet outside or you are on a wet floor.

I will definitely purchase them again.",4,1,5
"I love reading reviews and giving reviews. I was kinda Skeptical about these shoes, but I‚Äôm so glad that I purchased them. These shoes are so comfortable and I love the color. I worked out in them twice this week and they passed the test. They‚Äôre Worth the money.",5,1,5
The fit is perfect! I normally wear a 7 and that‚Äôs what I got. The inside is super cushiony and after wearing them all day for the first time- my feet felt great... even being 7 months pregnant. I also received tons of compliments on how cute they are!,5,1,5
"Comfortable right out of the box. I am on my feet 12 hrs./day and these are a good buy for the style and comfort! I thought I was buying Nike air, with the gel air cushioned heels but realized no. I have 2 pairs now. Navy pink and black. Many compliments on these running shoes.",5,1,5
I struggle to find a shoe to wear all day and be on my feet. These shoes are amazing. Complete comfort all day long.,5,1,5
Shoes are comfortable an fit perfect but they showed up already damanged. Shoe string is almost ripped off. Not to happy about it considering I just got them an they were like this when I opened it clearly they saw it while packing them,1,0,5
I bought these strictly for looks and the price was reasonable for a fashion shoe. Hope they will stand up for a while.,5,1,5
Sizing was exact! They are extremely light weight which is perfect for working out. However they do not provide much support and I have never twisted my ankle more in my life. -_- Probably should have read about them a bit more before buying but overall they a good shoes.,4,1,5
"Very small fit but gave them away
Because I never got my refund on a different pair I ordered so I figured I would just take the loss",1,0,5
I like these shoes for working out better than my more expensive brand name shoes. Highly recommend,5,1,5
"These shoes put a bounce in your step. The sizing is on the smaller size. I had ordered an 8, but the size on the tongue of the shoe is 7.5-8. I would suggest to size up. I also thought these were Nike, they‚Äôre not",3,0,5
I have wide feet so I'm always nervous to buy shoes without trying them on.... I was so surprised! These fit great and they are comfortable plus cute! I love them!,5,1,5
I got these shoes for my daughter and all my kids grow like weeds and love to barefoot but she wears these shoes all the time for any event.,5,1,5
"I bought these sneakers for walking. I like that they‚Äôre cushioned, which makes it nice walking. They are stylish. I just don‚Äôt like that there is no real support bc of the soft material it‚Äôs made with. Had it not been so soft, they would have been perfect! They are also good for a wide foot! I hope this is helpful for someone.",3,0,5
"Have been walking 4 to 5 miles per day! These shoes are so comfortable, plus I like how they look, too!",5,1,5
"I bought 2 pairs two weeks ago, the compliments are non stop! They are VERY sturdy yet comfortable, great for workouts and everyday use. You can't beat the price. Will purchase again. VERY SATISFIED üòå",5,1,5
I am overweight..so I do think that these are good athletic shoes but would give a better walk to those who have already conquered obesity...,3,0,5
Wish they were light weight but works just fine. Need to break them in they're quite snug .,5,1,5
I love the way these shoes look and feel. I am in my feet all day and these have been perfect.,5,1,5
Cute comfortable shoes. Had them less than a year and didn't even wear them and the sole split in the middle on both shoe's. Used for normal day to day wear and did not even wear everyday.,5,1,5
"Great product, gives great comfort and tight fit. Even thought it's a women shoe, it is great for men also.",5,1,5
I like the shoes. So cute! They look much more expensive than the price so love that! I highly recommend. :),5,1,5
Best shoe I've ever owned other than Sketchers. By far my favorite pair of shoes I own. My husband bought 2 pairs for himself and he loves the way the shoe feels on his foot.,5,1,5
"I wear a size 10 and they fit

I just got them today so I have to get use to them.

I did thought they was black and pink.

When I got them they was dark blue and pink but I still like them so far.

I feel a slight taller",5,1,5
I got these for a pg coworker that was looking for something more comfortable and more support during her shift. She absolutely loves them and can‚Äôt stop talking about them!,5,1,5
"Narrow. Comfortable. Toe is very pointed, which I don't like but they were more comfortable then the $120 shoes I had got on Amazon Wardrobe.",4,1,5
Size runs small and very narrow. I have narrow small feet and ordered half a size up. My toes were pinched and hurt. The cushion support feeling only lasts half a mile before it feels very flat. Save your money.,2,0,5
"This show is tight. The reviews say order regular size so I did. I purchased this shoe on 3/7/21. I went to wear the shoe for the first time yesterday (4/9/21), because of the fit of the shoeI decided to return them only to find out, I missed the return date. Now I‚Äôm out of $43 with a shoe I can‚Äôt wear. I‚Äôm not gonna pleased at all!",5,1,5
"I bought these shoes for 7 hour shifts. As a cashier, I typically stay in one spot for the whole 7 hours so I wanted a shoe that wouldn‚Äôt make my feet ache after a long shift. These are definitely better than past shoes I‚Äôve had but still a little aching after a long shift. This could be different for someone who is able to move/walk around a lot at work. Overall, they are still comfy and fit great!",4,1,5
The stitching on the inside was not very secure .,3,0,5
I haven‚Äôt worked out so I can‚Äôt comment on that however they are comfortable and provide support on the sole and heel of my feet. I believe if there were one more shoestring hole my ankles would be supported better.,5,1,5
"So I waited 2 weeks before writing my review because I wanted to be sure it was accurate, and I must say, as skeptical as I was about buying a off brand product, I could not be more happier. These shoes are AMAZING! They might even be better then my air max! They are comfy and light on your feet, I stand for 8+ hours in them, and my back feels great and my legs aren‚Äôt exhausted. I would definitely recommend, and I will definitely buy again!",5,1,5
I am typically an 8 - 8.5. I got an 8.5 but a 9 probably would have been more idea with thick running socks. Too much of a hassle to exchange unless they start to cause me problems.,4,1,5
These are overall great shoes. Good support. Lightweight. They pinch my toes together badly though and i even ordered a size up. Love the color and I wear them everyday to work.,5,1,5
I liked them the first day I wore them. After that the cushion feeling was gone and just felt hard. Should of just spent more and gotten a pair that i knew the quality wouldn't fail.,2,0,5
I got these shoes for work purposes because the arch on my foot hurts when I work in my Nike shoes ... I was skeptical about getting them but I am very glad I did... they look very nice and compared to the AirMax brand.. my arch doesn‚Äôt hurt anymore I‚Äôve been wearing there for almost 2 weeks now and they are easily becoming my favorite... I will be buying again.,5,1,5
Its comfortable and gives support in the heels but not for the whole foot. I work 10 hour days in a hospital and these did not give the support I was looking for.,3,0,5
I‚Äôm between an 8 & 8.5 in workout shoes. With these the 8 fit perfectly. Very comfortable at the gym. They look good as well.,5,1,5
"I was disappointed that I thought that I was getting a name brand shoe like Nile and they ended up being a off brand shoe even thought I searched Nike, I guess next time I have to read very carefully when selecting a product, over all they are comfortable shoes, they are a little big around the my ankle, good enough to use them for a work out shoe, or a shoe to work in?",2,0,5
these sneakers are comfortable but the are very wide on my foot. although I do have very thin feet and they are wide on my ankles. they are very cute and well padded but I will be sending them back because they won't stay on unless I tie them very tight..,4,1,5
These aren't bad considering the price. I wouldn't walk several miles in them but for hour long workouts they seen good,3,0,5
"Cute shoes. Could be more comfortable and the shoe strings aren't hidden like the picture. No big deal, I'll still rock them! üòé",4,1,5
Shoes comfortable for working out. And fit as expected. Recommend and good price.,5,1,5
Not comfortable. The material is crap. From China. It‚Äôs not cushion well nor is it comfortable to were. A bit tight on the size. And it honestly looks nice but the material is very cheaply made and you can tell just by feeling them. Refund honestly it‚Äôs not worth buying at all.,2,0,5
I actually was leery about buying an off brand shoe but decided to give it a try and I love them. They are so comfortable,5,1,5
Not that comfortable to be honest. I mean it‚Äôs cute but I definitely wouldn‚Äôt try running in them again. It‚Äôs not lightweight. I‚Äôd just wear these to only walk short distances in.,3,0,5
I bought this as a gift for my mom. She really loves these sneakers! The only issue is that she said it was a little tight but she just needs to break them in. It also came in a cute bag lol,5,1,5
"Super comfortable, i use mine for running and it really help my entire body feel like its easier to take steps when your feet are comfortable!",5,1,5
As expected the shoes fit nicely. It is a good looking pair of shoes too. Walked almost 2 miles in them and they hurt a little. They are new shoes so I need to break them in. I also think a pair of Dr Scholls would help.,3,0,5
"Best work shoes I have had in a long time. Bought these to wear for work (I‚Äôm a server) so I am on my feet all day. These are super comfy and look just as described.
I get lots of compliments!",5,1,5
"I was looking for a shoe with support as my foot pronates in. These do not keep that from happening as the material is fairly soft. However, they are so comfortable that I am keeping them.",5,1,5
"I love these shoes. Comfy, tight, and the perfect runners. I didn‚Äôt have sore body after wearing these.",5,1,5
"I use these shoes for walking, I wish they had more of an arch support",5,1,5
They are so comfy!! Perfect for being on feet for 8hrs!!!,5,1,5
"They're comfortable. Fit great. On top of that! I knew that they were purple, the color is more amazing and bold. Love the color ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,1,5
These are so comfy,5,1,5
"They‚Äôre super cute and comfy. Ordered them oct 9th 2020, it‚Äôs oct 31st 2021 and the bottoms are starting to wear out.",5,1,5
I love these athletic shoes. Very comfortable and cute as well.,5,1,5
They look nice and from what I hear they‚Äôre pretty comfy,4,1,5
Always get a 1/2 size bigger when you buy any shoe. I love them very comfortable when I walk my 4 dogs,5,1,5
Very comfortable! I teach all day in these with little foot pain. Even helped my plantar fasciitis some when coupled with a brace.,5,1,5
"Fits good, runs a little small. I usually wear a size 9 but bought 9 1/2 and they fit perfect.",5,1,5
I don‚Äôt like writing negative reviews so I will just say these shoes really weren‚Äôt for me. They were very stiff and made my lower back hurt. I am on my feet for the majority of the day and I couldn‚Äôt wait to get these off of my feet!,2,0,5
"Love them, but wish they would have a loop to keep the tongue in place.",4,1,5
Love the shoes Perfect and feels good on my feet. And hasn‚Äôt given me any blisters on my ankles,5,1,5
I don‚Äôt know what people like about this shoes uncomfortable heavy and not easy to walk with is just a bulky orange thing on your feet if you‚Äôre looking for running shoes this are NOT the one.,2,0,5
True to size n soo lightweight !! Perfect for wearing with scrubs the only downfall the front says running and is very floppy.But id definitely recommend üëå,5,1,5
All of it except that they are a bit heavy for running.,5,1,5
Super impressed with how comfortable they are immediately. Hoping that they last at least a year for my walks.,5,1,5
I am definitely going to get another pair in another color. I stand up all day at work and these are extremely comfortable. By the middle of the day I am usually ready to take my shoes off but with these I don‚Äôt. I have gotten so many compliments.,5,1,5
Great support and comfort! I love the style!,5,1,5
Cheap product. Pure trash. Came falling apart cheap material. Returned it,1,0,5
"Shoes are really comfortable qnd look great too, I had some other walking running shoes they just didn't have the support these have great support",5,1,5
Cute and comfy for work in the warehouse. Didn‚Äôt even get dirty as fast as I thought. Arrived quicker than expected.,5,1,5
"Choose 10.5"", but it would have been ok at 10"". Comfortable for my weekly aerobics workout",4,1,5
it‚Äôs best to get a half size bigger once you break them in they might be a little more comfortable so it depends on your activity I work in a hospital and I walk all day it‚Äôs not enough support but I like the style and the price,5,1,5
"These shoes are amazing, I got the black ones and they are so comfortable. They for amazing and so soft when you walk in them. I am so happy I bought these. I plan to buy in other colors",5,1,5
"My daughter love them
Extra comfortable and great support
Perfect fit as well",5,1,5
Love the appearance of the shoe. Looks like nike air shocks. Very comfortable,5,1,5
"I have only worn them for 1 day; however, I was pleasantly surprised @ how comfortable these shoes are. An EXCELLENT purchase!",5,1,5
Very comfortable for all day wear. Love the extra support in the heel area.,5,1,5
"Fit as expected, do slide on the inside a little but didn't bother me when I walk. Haven't used them on the treadmill yet.",5,1,5
When I order these I thought while with a good deal. Come to find out their wrath the real brand name. I will give a better review after it put him on a wearing longer,2,0,5
"Wore them today for the first time they are extremely heavy and the tongue on them are huge. I‚Äôm on my for for long periods of time in healthcare and would
Not recommend",2,0,5
"Love it. It's what it shows in the pictures.. fits comfortably, and the cushion padding is very soft . I'm on my feet everyday and it keeps my feet from hurting... compare to other shoes.
Thank you guys.",5,1,5
Awesome,5,1,5
Comes with travel bag! Seems very comfortable. Got real Nikes on clearance so I don't need these sneakers. Look just like picture! Very cute!,5,1,5
"I wear these to work for 12 hour shifts. They are very comfortable, more comfortable than more expensive shoes in my experience. I get compliments on them almost every time I work. They only lasted about 6 months but for the price, I don't mind.",5,1,5
"They are super cute shoes, but I used these shoes for less than a week at my job where i‚Äôm constantly on my feet, and about two days into wearing them they made my feet ache. They offer no real support and it feels like you are walking on straight concrete until you take them off. I do NOT recommend buying these unless they are strictly for style.",5,1,5
Very comfortable for all day wear. The tongue sticks out a bit but other than that fits well.,5,1,5
They fit just as I had hoped they would!,4,1,5
I love these shoes! They are the perfect fit. I stand and walk all day for work and these are so comfortable.,5,1,5
llego muy rapido en una excelente presentaci√≥n y a muy buen precio,5,1,5
I am glad I bought the sneaker will be purchasing another pair. They are so comfortable.,5,1,5
I bought these shoes from my girlfriend it was love at first sight she loves wearing them because they‚Äôre very comfortable,5,1,5
I love my shoes fits right love color love it and the price amazing,5,1,5
"Shoes came in very nice looking and my wife said that they were comfortable to wear I am very disappointed about how they were sold to me. I had searched air Jordan women‚Äôs shoes and found these surrounded by Nike‚Äôs with air on the side and thought the Gannou was the store or sellers name not the brand Of shoe. Very misleading product placement. So far my wife says they are ok and they are nice looking but, we thought we were getting Nike air",3,0,5
Not a bad pair of shoes for the price. Received many compliments on the style. I‚Äôm usually a size 9.5/10 but went with a 9.5 and it fit perfectly. If you have wide feet or they tend to swell I would get a size 10. Used them for my warehouse job where I‚Äôm standing or walking all day. First time wearing them was a little uncomfortable but they were comfortable after breaking them in.,4,1,5
"Look great! But im a size 7.5 and thats the size i got and there a little big could have probably gotten a 7. I only wore them a little while, not to bad hopefully after i ware them in they get a little more comfortable. But over all pretty happy with them. I would say its worth it. 7/10 is the score i would give",3,0,5
Hated them stretched out after 1st few wearings,2,0,5
"Shoes were uncomfortable, the air logo also makes one believe they are made by Nike when in reality they are not",3,0,5
This shoe's toe box I could not even get my foot completely in the shoe to try it on. I liked the outer design but everything else was obviously inexpensively made. Would not recommend.,1,0,5
"I work in the ICU as a Respiratory Therapist, so I walk constantly. These shoes were a great purchase, I got more done the days that I wore these shoes because my feet were hurting as usual. They can give the big name brands a run for their money, because the comfort, support and style that these shoes reign supreme.",5,1,5
Very comfortable and cute with simple design that's flattering with all outfits!!!,5,1,5
Not a good fit. Plus no support when you walking so you're bouncing in the shoe,1,0,5
They run small. I wear a 6.5 but there shoes are in sizes 6-6.5 are the same. They are cute but cheap made.,3,0,5
Fit as expected. Liked the color and style but the comfort was a bit to be desired.,3,0,5
"I am a bartender who works on my feet on hard floor for 12 hours at a time. My feet always hurt and I have bought foot massagers throughout the years to combat it. These tennis shoes are surprisingly comfortable, especially for the fact that they are decently priced!",5,1,5
These shows are vibrant and so comfortable!,5,1,5
"I'll be honest!!! I thought I was ordering Nike's! So when I received these I was a little disappointed, however once I put them on I was so happy! They may not be the cutest shoes (especially the black and white) but they are amazing running shoes. Out of all brands I'll say that they surpass many major brands in comfort.",5,1,5
It seems like almost a size too big,2,0,5
I go to gym with this. Was Good.,5,1,5
Granddaughter love them. Wears them for work on her feet for eight hours and no problems with feet hurting as before.,5,1,5
These sneakers look and fit great. They're so stylish and can be worn with anything. I absolutely love them!,5,1,5
Good fit comfortably for walking or just leisure!,5,1,5
"I cannot use these for running, they make my feet go numb because the width is not the same as my other shoes. I gifted them.",3,0,5
These sneakers are sooooo comfortable. I forgot I had them on all day at work. I also have them in red. They run about a half size big so I went down a half size when I purchased the black ones.,5,1,5
These shoes run big but are narrow. There is little to no cushion and no arch support at all.,3,0,5
Very comfortable. I'm very selective due to back and foot issues. Would recommend üëå,5,1,5
They where amazing shoes. The only problem I have is that they are a little smaller than what it says. I still could fit mine but it's a little tight.,4,1,5
This is comfortable and love to run every time I wear it!,5,1,5
Small and narrow. They were fairly comfortable (except for being small & tight) but the craftsmanship was not very good. The heal on one shoe was misshapen and the seams did not line up well.,3,0,5
Love the show but after wearing them now the bottom of the shoe is coming off,5,1,5
The sneaker itself is comfortable. But it‚Äôs heavy especially if you wear all day.,3,0,5
"Great look, I got a lot of compliments.",5,1,5
Really nice shoe. Runs wide though,4,1,5
Not enough cushion,3,0,5
Super comfy i feel like I could run a marathon right now. Great support and super cute. üòç,5,1,5
"These shoes are very cute, so comfortable. I like the cushion in the shoes bt its a little slippery. When im running on the treadmill i can feel my heals sliding just a bit i do feel tht is going to wear my shoes out rather quickly",4,1,5
"Awesome, very comfortable shoes. True to size, highly recommend!",5,1,5
"Not the best quality as far as fine details on appearance! But neither am I! ... for this price can‚Äôt complain! I work with dogs everyday in multiple scenarios from grooming to bathing! Being soaked when they get out of the pool! Getting dirty from sand, mud , grasses, chemicals, poop!.... you name it! I highly recommend these shoes",5,1,5
Unable to work out or even walk around in these. The bottoms are to slippery I was sliding on my kitchen floor.,1,0,5
My daughter likes the shoes. She says they are great for work.,5,1,5
I really love the look of this shoe! It definitely is a half size off though. I wear a size 7 and need a 7 1/2. Other than that great. Had to give them to my daughter. May order another pair for the great price.,4,1,5
"I should have known that with the price under $40, this was a return. The sneakers are cute, comfortable but used. The track on the bottom is slightly dirty. They are a little big but could not afford to go down a size. Not sure i am keeping them.",3,0,5
"I bought this shoe for walking my dogs. The fit is good but when walking‚Ä¶ the inside is cheaply made, I can feel the surface. So I only use them in the house.",2,0,5
Ordered a 10 got a 9 1/2 in the mail toebox way too narrow especially if you need to have planter fasciitis inserts in,2,0,5
They are great but I should have brought a half size smaller,4,1,5
It seems to be more pretty as color as well as more cheap.,5,1,5
Loved them they fit perfect and not to mention very comfortable The first day I wore them I received so many compliments,5,1,5
"I took a chance and bought these running shoes (my regular ones were out of stock) and I was pleasantly surprised! The look, the fit, the comfort and the price all worked perfectly!",5,1,5
This shoe is not comfortable at all it's very hard and needs to be remade and taken out the ware house until it's made correctly I wore it one time and the shoes are sitting in my closet that's how uncomfortable they are I really need a refund,1,0,5
"Super comfy, light weight. Super cute. I have received so many compliments on this shoe",5,1,5
Fits just right. Glad got the extra 1/2 size. Good looking shoe.,4,1,5
√âstos zapatos son muy c√≥modos y de muy buena calidad. Est√°n hermosos y el tama√±o queda exacto.,5,1,5
Literally feels like I‚Äôm walking barefoot on concrete. I got these because the reviews say they are comfortable but they are not for me :(,3,0,5
"The ‚ÄúAir‚Äù is super deceptive. These are NOT Nike shoes. Other than that, they‚Äôre comfy and cute. I just don‚Äôt appreciate how close they are to being knock offs. I know to read the description more thoroughly from now on.",2,0,5
I loved the colors but the insoles are crappy so purchase insoles and you will be fine many friends thought they were Nike lol,2,0,5
My daughter loves these shoes. They were inexpensive but seem to be made well. They are also in style with what other teens are wearing.,5,1,5
I like the heel and support most but very cute and they are true to size. Happy with purchase.,4,1,5
"The heel was so wide, my foot would slip out of the shoe when I walked.",1,0,5
Fit very snug just like I wanted.,5,1,5
These sneakers are comfortable and I get a lot of compliments. For the most part I have a lot of pain in the heel of my foot. Well the pain is less than normal.,5,1,5
I bought these as a gift for my daughter for Christmas and they are very cute and true to size and recommend these for anyone that are is plan on running or do a lot of walking,5,1,5
"These shoes torn up on me. They split right in half on the sole. Very disappointed. I threw them away. I will purchase these shoes again. They look good, but bad on quality",1,0,5
Not worth the buy. Not very comfortable,1,0,5
My wife says they are awesome and fit as expected we‚Äôll see how long they last!,4,1,5
Very comfortable,5,1,5
"Comfortable, a little roomy but worth the price",5,1,5
Love!!! Not only just cute but so comfy and supportive. It's a hug for my feet.,5,1,5
"They are pretty and nice, but Not for running or work out. More like a fashion sneakers.",3,0,5
These were so much better than expected and the orice was definitely right! I adore the little ahoe bag they come in too!,5,1,5
"Great to walk, run or exercise. Definitely feels different for me since I had different shoes. However, I feel more comfortable in these shoes than any other pair of shoes I have had in the past.",5,1,5
Arrived on time and as promised. Fits great & very comfortable.,5,1,5
I got the 7 1/2 to 8 size sneaker and it fits like a seven it is so tight and so small. I am returning this,1,0,5

Bought for someone who does a lot of walking. Seem to be performing quite well.,4,1,5
They are a lot heavier than I expected. Especially considering they are call AIR. The toe is more narrow than is comfortable and more narrow than it appears in advertisement. They are more bulky than they look in advertisement.,2,0,5
Love these shoes ! I ordered half a size up just to make space for my feet to swell (preggers) and based on that I would say they are true to size. Very comfortable and lightweight. I have these are my work shoes but use them for walks too! So many compliments on them.,5,1,5

I bought these shoes back in December.

"I like the look of this shoe and its versatility style wise but as for fit and functionality I find them to be just a bit smaller than what they were supposed to be, also having a very high arch is always an issue and this shoe fails to even begin to touch my arch at all, not a bad shoe if you are wearing them , like I said before, for fashion but as an athletic shoe they miss the mark.",5,1,5

Shoes look great but are definitely not the same quality as the name brand I am accustomed to. Tried to use them for a week and donated. I wouldn‚Äôt consider this an actual running shoe. Fine for casual wear or short walks.,2,0,5

I use these shoes for work and walks and they are always super comfortable,5,1,5
The shoe is very nice but I got the wrong size for my daughter.,4,1,5

"I love running, and I love long distances (favorite racing distances are 10K, 12K, 15K, and half marathons). Back in my high school track-and-field days, I was fitted and told I need to use a specific line of Brooks for support. Eventually I evolved to like Saucony; mainly because they were cheaper but also because the fit...worked? After I started triathlons and Ironmans a few years ago, my miles grew exponentially so I decided to get refitted for a better sneaker once more. I found the Brooks Ghost at that point and was very pleased for nearly 9-ish months. They were a comfortable shoe that fit me well, however I found over time, the lack of ankle support really started to take it's toll. FYI, I change out my shoes roughly every 3-4 months depending on the amount of miles ran. By about last December, I started to get right foot pain after each run. Instead of looking elsewhere, I bought the next generation of Brooks Ghost. This seemed to only worsen the lack of ankle support and regular foot pain after longer distances. Finally, in search of another shoe, I found myself drawn to Nike even though I've never owned a pair of Nikes in my life. RunnersWorld and Triathlon articles have many suggested brands, and I never thought I'd see the day Nike was in their top 10. I must've missed how much Nike has changed their line of runners over the past decade; suggesting that their shoes are now more comfortable and faster. I decided to take a chance with the Air Zoom Pegasus 36. The moment I put these on, they felt AMAZING! Typically any pair of new running shoes needs some time doing low miles to really break them in, however these adorable lime green Pegasus felt like they were made for my feet from day one! I should advise, I do have normal to narrower feet and these fit like a glove. The Pegasus is like a cloud supporting all the right places, springing comfortably with each stride, and VERY lightweight! I was so surprised at the light feel that I put these on an ounce/gram scale to compare with my Ghosts. The Pegasus 36 pair weighed in at 478 grams and the Ghost 12 pair weighed in at 568... a 90g difference! That may not sound like much but when you add miles or do the distance after 90K of biking, shaving off a few grams can make all the difference. On my first run with these I took them to the track and did 8.5 miles, 6.25 of which at race pace. I got some of my fastest times recorded in a long time on the track that day. And bonus, no ankle or foot pain! I also did not need to stretch regularly between splits, because my legs felt amazing! Time will really tell how the Pegasus will hold up against the elements, but to be honest, even if these don't make it as my new, forever running brand, I would be happy to keep these as an everyday walking shoe. They are OH SO COMFORTABLE! Today after my run I actually put them back on to wear at work for a 12-hour shift. I can honestly say I never did that with my Ghosts 11s or 12s. :-)

I'll report back in a few months to advise how these are holding up. ...maybe by then I'll actually get to run a race in these?!?!?! *hopes* That is, if Covid-19 ever calms the fudge down!!!!

Hope y'all stay safe and healthy out there! Cheers!

***5 month update***** I still love the Nike Pegasus 36. Since July I purchased a 2nd pair in pink/black in order to alternate wear. The shoes still feel as comfortable as ever. I have even been able to run two Covid-approved races since October (a 10K and Half Marathon) where I placed 1st place overall female in both! However, I discovered that while I love the light-weight and energy transfer from the Pegasus, I am a greater fan of them with in shorter distances. When reaching the 13 mile mark, my joints feel as those they could use more stability. In a 10K, the Pegasus worked fantastic! I compared a half marathon solo run with the Pegasus then did the same with my old Brooks Ghost. While the Brooks still caused a few blisters and foot pain, my knees and poster kept better than with the Pegasus. I've learned that sometimes too much cushion with less structure can cause more work for the body to maneuver between stride (for me at least). I am still a complete fan of the Pegasus and will continue to use them in training and DEFINITELY for any races shorter than 13.1 miles. However, I am now on the hunt for another shoe that'll go the distance with the same lightness and bounce as the Pegasus but with stability to keep my form in check when I reach those ""greater fatigue miles"".

Thanks for listening! Happy running! :-D",5,1,5
I have plantar fasciitis and need to wear shoes with good arch support. I LOVE my Nike shoes. They are light in weight and the insoles are the most important part.,4,1,5
I LOVE MY SHOES!! Recently had weightloss surgery and needed a good walking shoe... Boy did i find a good one,5,1,5
"I‚Äôve been wearing the Pegasus series for years and they have fit perfectly. I walk, run and kick around in these shoes. This latest in the Pegasus line is good looking but less functional. The overall fit is good except the back top (heel/ankle). It‚Äôs as if the shoe gets relaxed there and leaves enough of a gap to allow heel to move hence rub. I tighten the laces and it still happens. Will be investing in different shoes for an upcoming 7K. These will be for short, walking outings around town.",3,0,5
"For folks with hard to fit feet or walkers/runners that need the most comfort in a shoe, this is it. I always come back to Nike. This shoe is like walking on marshmallows!
Air Zoom would be the best shoe for everyone, perhaps even elite runners. I tried to use a cheaper shoe but I just wasted my money. This is the shoe you want.",5,1,5
"Unbelievable! I ordered these shoes because my knees were killing me when walking with friends twice a day during our social distancing ordeal. I couldn‚Äôt go to the store so I ordered the brand I used to run marathons with and they came less than 36 hours later, fit perfectly and I‚Äôm back with the walking group. Also, they are mesh and breath so I‚Äôm very happy.",5,1,5
"Unfortunately, this is the second Nike product I've purchased 'new' through Amazon that arrived worn. The shoe box was damaged and held together with rubber bands and the shoes were clearly worn from prior use. Needless to say I didn't have the desire to even try them on. My first purchase, a Nike drifit shirt wasn't even the right style/size from the photo and smelled like BO. Moral of the story is that I am done purchasing Nike through Amazon.",1,0,5
"Right out of the box these fit great - I have Pegasus 32 (owned for 3 years and I've walked 4 miles every day for over a year) and Pegasus Shield 35 (water resistant). Nikes are lightweight and my favorite feel for sneakers. I've tried 4 pairs of Brooks and the feel just isn't the same. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the way the back (collar) scoops downward under the ankle on either side of the shoe. It just didn't cover up enough of my heel, so the shoe shifted off my heel when it left the ground. I knew I would have a rubbed spot on the back of my heel after mile one. Otherwise I loved them, but ended up returning the Nikes and went with the next-best Adrenaline GTS 20 from Brooks.",4,1,5
"BE CAREFUL when buying from this retailer!! My shoes came with NONE of the original packaging, including box, tags, and wrappings. I looked online and it looks like it was bought from liquidation channels and It‚Äôs not ‚ÄúAmazon New‚Äù",1,0,5
"I bought these in wide width because I have flat feet and need the extra width to fit right. When I got the box it didn‚Äôt say wide on it anywhere. Usually Nike has a sticker on the box that says wide width. The shoe didn‚Äôt say it anywhere, either.

So I pulled out my other Nikes, same exact size, and looked at the tag on the tongue, which clearly says WIDTH: W (circled in purple). I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the way the tongue is sewn onto the shoe or what, but they‚Äôre very tight. Busted can of biscuits comes to mind! You can see the gap when I have the shoe on between the shoe and the tongue. I finally had to Google the code number on the tongue to verify that these were supposed to be wide, but they didn‚Äôt fit like it. The little strings that run around the laces were annoying to thread. I adjusted everything I could think of and they just didn‚Äôt fit or look right. The tongue also comes up at an angle which just adds to the weirdness factor to me. They went right back in the box to return. I was really hoping they‚Äôd be better! I‚Äôll stick with the downshifter and revolution.",3,0,5
"I purchased these to replace my work shoes. I bought these shoes after ordering the Nike Tanjuns. I wore the Downshifter line, however they have stopped making them. I looked for a shoe similar in style and fit to the Downshifters. The Tanjuns were awful, I felt like my foot had been walking on a flat surface all day. I believe it‚Äôs due to no rubber tread at the bottom. I ordered the Pegasus‚Äô after 1 time of wearing the Tanjuns. The Pegasus‚Äô are so comfortable, with lots of padded and rubber support, as well as curvature. They were comfortable on the first day, no need for a ‚Äúbreak in‚Äù period. I will be ordering a second pair for recreation.",5,1,5
"Difficult to get your foot in. There is a piece of fabric connecting the tongue of the shoe to the body of the shoe (and not just at the bottom of the tongue like on most athletic shoes, but almost all the way up the side to the top of the tongue). This makes it very difficult to get your foot into the shoe. But what's worse, if you have thick socks on or if your feet are a little swollen (as they sometimes are during that time of the month when you're retaining water), loosening the shoelaces to give your foot more room, does no good because the tongue of the shoe is still constraining your foot.

I also don't like the way these shoes lace-up. It's easy to make sure the laces are tight enough but it's impossible to loosen them to any extent (see comment above) making the shoe feel too tight across the instep.

Lastly, the sides of the shoe are cut too low to the point where it feels like your foot is only halfway in the shoe.

I'm really disappointed in this model of Nike.",3,0,5
These shoes were used not new and they smelled faintly of vinegar or sweaty feet. They had dirt on the heels and marks on the outside as well. The white cushion at the bottom around the shoe had several creases showing that it was used for more than just trying on. The bottom of the shoes also smelled like flowery hand soap which says to me the bottom of the shoe was washed. Please don‚Äôt con your consumers on here this is a valuable service/company which has made raising three young children much easier with their fast delivery services.,1,0,5
"Just ran first 4 miles in these. They are comfortable and seem supportive. The toebox is a bit strange. I have normal width feet, not narrow, but when I laced them up, when I pulled the laces tighter on the toebox it puckered the fabric in a strange way (see picture). This didn't seem to affect the functionality but it definitely is a design flaw. Hopefully it doesn't cause any issues over time. As always, I tell people Nikes run SMALL. I always purchase a size bigger than the shoes I normally wear and then it's a perfect fit. I will try to post later about further wear and functionality.",4,1,5
My heel slips out even walking so I can't use them to run. They angle my feet causing it to hurt after 5 minutes of walking because the same powerstep inserts perfect for Brooks Ghosts cause me to walk on the outside bones of my feet in these. I had to go out and buy a pair of Brooks instead and these just sit in my bin unused. I hate that I wasted money on them. I tried to wear them to a hockey game and my feet hurt before I even got to my seat. In my Brooks I can jog the block just fine and power walk the treadmill every night for 40 minutes unharmed.,1,0,5
"This is my 3rd pair of these.. WONDERFUL shoe - BEWARE OF SELLER - ! The pair shipped to me this time was clearly a floor model or used pair. Packaging was all tore up, toes stretched out, NO inserts. Again, I‚Äôve unpacked this same shoe several times.. beware of seller. Clearly cleaning up used models priced @ NEW !",1,0,5
"The Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 34 have always been my go-to shoes, but they're harder and harder to find these days. I figured I would try out the 36 as a comparable model, but in my opinion they run about a half a size smaller, and don't have nearly the same amount of support as the 34 model. Had to return.",3,0,5
"This is one of my all time favorite shoes! My favorite color is pink and I love how bright these shoes are. I work long shifts and am always on my feet, these leave my feet comfortable and stylish.",5,1,5
"These are so pink! I love them!

Nike Zooms are my favorite running shoes. I clock about 6 miles a day and they never let me down. Bought this hot pink pair to replace my previous pair of Zooms that I completely killed over 2000 run miles in.

These are comfortable out of the box, light weight, no gait correction, and the hot pink and black is to die for. If you have ever loved a pair of Nike Zooms, don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôre still great.

Kudos to whichever Amazon employee was responsible for wrapping the shoebox in plastic packaging. It was a rainy day and my shoes were protected until I got home.",5,1,5
"These shoes are the bomb dot Com!!!!
I work at a hospital and originally I needed to replace my training nikes because after just a year they got a hole in it (I wear them everyday and walking in the hospital as well) I also work out in them.
These shoes are SO comphy! Just like all the reviews I had read said.
They fit like a glove.
So....great product!!",5,1,5
"Although I have not road tested my Nike's yet, I've been purchasing this same style for the last 3 or so years. Generally, I go down to the mall and I receive great customer service from our local Champs store. When malls began to open again, I promptly went to the same store only to find they have closed! Another great Honolulu merchant, out of business.

I was a little reluctant to purchase running shoes online but considered the quality and consistent fit over the years, I ordered and I'm very happy to say, they are everything I expected!",5,1,5
"I've been a fan of the 35s, I owned 4 pairs and loved them. When the 36s came out I was hesitant to buy them. With the pandemic going on I couldn't try them on at a store but decided why not. I work in a warehouse that has cement floors and constantly moving. These shoes are amazing! I found my feet hurting a lot less and having more energy. I find that there is extra cushion in the ball of the foot and the heel which is what I need.",5,1,5
"I was skeptical buying training shoes online. As a Personal Trainer it‚Äôs important to have shoes that perform well under multiple situations such as cardio AND resistance training. The first time I tried them on, they felt slightly tight but after a couple of days of breaking them in they are absolutely perfect! These are really good for agility movements without making my feet shuffle side to side inside the shoes. They are also very comfortable. I may need to purchase a second pair to rotate between two pairs.",5,1,5
I was nervous about buying running shoes online but I‚Äôm glad that I did! I bought these after having used the Nike Lunarglide running shoes for years. I run 3-5 days a week and about 3-5 miles a day average. I‚Äôm so glad that I tried the Nike Zoom shoes!!! They have amazing support and the knee and hip and back pain I was having with run the few months before getting these shoes is gone. I feel great again even after running 7 miles this morning. I love how they feel supportive and lightweight. I will buy these again.,5,1,5
"I spend 10-12 hours on my feet at work, so good shoes are a must. I went with the cheaper design in an 11 (I normally wear a 10.5 in Nike) and am glad I did bc these are a little snug in the toes. I do have a wide foot though, so if you're more narrow you could probably do your regular size. I got the grey with tan bottoms bc they were $70 cheaper than the style I wanted, and will definitely be buying these in more colors to match my scrubs. Great shoe, very happy with my purchase",5,1,5
"The most comfortable pair of Nikes ever. Got them primarily for my indoor workouts, haven't worn them outside much, yet sadly after less than 9 months, they already have a large hole in the material on top of the toe box area. Maybe there was an issue with this pair that wasn't noticeable until it developed? I'm not sure but I think they should have lasted longer than that.",3,0,5
I love these shoes. I was looking for good shoes to wear at work as a nurse working 12 hour shifts. These are very soft and comfortable. Very supportive.,5,1,5
"I have an unusual Size. It is hard to find some thing that fits my foot.
I needed A shoe that did not weigh a ton. The shoe is lightweight and conforms to my foot correctly. I basically bought it to wear as a good support you around my house. I have foot issues and it relieved my pain because of the construction of the shoe. So far so good.",5,1,5
"I‚Äôm doubting the authenticity of these Nikes. I own over 50 pairs of Nikes, all in size 7. These say size 7 on the tag but fit like an 8. They‚Äôre HUGE! Why?? I‚Äôve attached a picture to show these on the left next to a similar pair I own on the right that is actually a size 7. I would love to exchange these for a pair that fit, but I just don‚Äôt even think they are real Nikes now.",1,0,5
"Overall I'm happy with these shoes. The only thing I am not crazy about in the pointed heal. In my opinion it is ugly. I know it is supposed to be more aerodynamic, but unless you are a serious competitive runner, it really isn't necessary. I have worn pegasus shoes for many years now to run, and these are very comfortable and supportive. They feel slightly stiffer than the old pegasus but the weight is nice. I would recommend these shoes. Also they arrived on time but the packaging made me wonder if they had been repackaged or returned. They didn't appear to be worn so I kept them.",4,1,5
"I bought these shoes because I loved the color. ( it is a very bright pink ). Having never tried them on, I wasn‚Äôt sure if they‚Äôd be comfortable. I bought a half size smaller than I normally wear. (81/2 instead of a 9) They are absolutely PERFECT and so comfortable. Im on my feet a lot and these shoes are great. Highly recommend !",5,1,5
"These shoes are quite good for runners! I hover around 30 miles per week and run mostly on concrete. These shoes are not too narrow which is sometimes a concern. They fit as expected (I got a woman's 7) and are very comfortable. The colors are exactly as shown in the picture. I prefer the Nike Pegasus Zoom 35, (this is the updated version), but this version is still a great shoe.",5,1,5
"I have always ran in Nike's, usually Nike Air Max Triax. I thought these shoes would be great running shoes for my marathon. I tried them on the day I got them and they were tight and the back on the heel area is very low. I knew it would be bad for me. So I printed up a return label.
Yes, I took awhile (a month and a half) to take them to the UPS store because I was finishing grad school and had many late nights and no time to spare. I took them in today and I see a refund issued for $78.79. I paid $95.97. I would not have cared if I didn't get the refund until they received them to verify that they had not been used at all. Maybe they wait until they receive them to issue the full amount but this was not said. I did not get a full refund.",1,0,5
"I was really hopeful, when I first tried them on. It felt almost like a cloud. However, in the time of wearing it for a whole two days, that quickly disappeared. I suppose if you‚Äôre only needing support casually for a 30 min walk, maybe twice a week, it might be ok. But if you need support for standing and working long hours, forget it.",3,0,5
"I'm not a long-long distance runner or I would have had to return these. but since I only run about 3-5 miles a day, these work fine. The ankle is too low on the foot to give an adequate fit for anything longer. You'll get blisters. But they have very good support and are comfortable for short distances.",3,0,5
"These shoes are amazing! I tore my Achilles last year and every shoe hurts to wear. These are supportive and flexible enough, they don‚Äôt hurt! Thank you Nike!!!!",5,1,5
The most comfortable sneaker I have ever purchased. When I walk the sneaker has an awesome shock absorber; this is very important as I am an avid walker six days a week. Nice looking on the outside feels good on the inside.,5,1,5
I have run 4x in these and so far so good for 6 miles and under. The arch is really high so I don‚Äôt think they will work for me for longer runs because my feet have been a little sore in the arch at the 6 mile point.,4,1,5
"I love this show so much! I had the previous version and they fit ok but occasionally rubbed blisters. The updates to the shoe keep it from moving around as much, so no blisters. They are lighter weight than the previous model. The shoelaces are a better length for alternate lacing. I love this show so much I‚Äôm seriously considering buying another pair just to have a backup.",5,1,5
"I suffer from Plantar Fascitis, very comfortable, great support. My feet do not hurt at all when I go jogging.",5,1,5
"I love these shoes! This is my third pair in the past couple of months. I have problems with my feet and they are SO comfortable. I saw my podiatrist yesterday who recommended sole inserts (for all my shoes), due to extremely high arches. She was very impressed with these shoes and said they were a great choice, Whew",5,1,5
"I expected more from Nike. The shoe tended to be slightly smaller for me. I bought them for the arch support which seems ok.
I walk the dog twice a day for a total of 15-17 miles a week, but now I seem to be having pain in my heel and the shoe isn‚Äôt very comfortable with supports added.
Would not buy again.",3,0,5
"Beautiful shoe, fit is snug and toe is longer than another Nike style I have. I had high hopes considering the glowing reviews and the cost. The tongue of the shoe is stationary which surprised me. I would probably return but to much of a hassle. Overall seems well made.",4,1,5
"I‚Äôm always looking for a white tennis shoe I can wear with pants that don‚Äôt look like tennis shoes. I have bought this pair twice, I get lots of compliments on them. Love the soft pink laces and tortoise swoosh.",5,1,5
"These shoes are generally comfortable, but I would disagree that they are for over pronation. They have minimal arch support. The sides are very soft and light, so not much motion control. If you‚Äôre a person with super flat roly-poly feet, you might look elsewhere.",3,0,5
"This is my second pair of Pegasuses and neither has disappointed. The support is great, they're super comfortable, my feet don't freeze with a light sock on in the winter (I don't run under 35 degrees F), and they don't sweat much if at all in the summer. I love the color, too. I usually wear a size 9 or 9.5 in other shoes but sized up to a 10 for these and they fit perfectly.",5,1,5
"I have purchased previous versions of these running shoes, but these did not feel the same. The cut is very low below the ankle and the bulky heel was odd. I decided to return them and give up on this model.",2,0,5
"I use the shoes for work, where I am on my feet for 9 hours a day. Nike shoes are my go to and these don't disappoint. Love the shoes and they are comfortable. I have a hard time finding size 9 that fit my feet just right, main reason I love Nike so much.",5,1,5
"Thought buying a newer model ‚ÄúZoom Pegasus 36‚Äù pictured in the grey would be as good or better than my beloved ‚ÄúZoom Pegasus 35‚Äù pink shoe in pic. The 36 in the heel wall is 1/4 -1/2?inch shorter than the 35 .... which translates into shoe NOT hugging my entire heel and my heel moves up/down with each step ‚òπÔ∏è... returning 36... it just doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhug‚Äù support... but ball of foot cushion of 36 is GREAT!!! It is the same cushion, fit and support as the 35. To bad they changed the heel wall!!!!",3,0,5
"To be honest, I was very disappointed with this shoe. I have the Pegasus 35‚Äôs and I like them so much better. This shoe is lighter, but did not feel as comfortable or supportive as the 35. I can wear them for everyday but I do not like them for walking. I do not like the short tongue and overall it just doesn‚Äôt feel like it supports my whole foot.",2,0,5
"Worth buying.Chic looking .One very impt thing to know though this style runs small and quite narrow .I am a regular size 7 but have to size to 7.5 .
Nice work out/running shoes .",5,1,5
I have been wearing Pegasus for a long time. Last pair were 33. This model 36 seems lighter and very comfortable. The bottom structure is quite different especially in heel area. Hope it doesn‚Äôt wear out quickly. That is my only concern as I wear for many miles. O,5,1,5
Bought them for a friend and loves them!,5,1,5
Great shoe for runners second pair I‚Äôve bought for my daughter,5,1,5
I used these as walking shoes and the heels wore out in 2 months. The insoles have no support. I ended up with heel pain and plantar fasciitis. Will not be buying Nike again.,5,1,5
"I had to order a half size larger than I usually wear in this shoe. Overall I really like it. Gives good support, nice look, comfortable.",5,1,5
Nice Nike shoe. I buy the same or very similar style Nike for my honking size 11 feet. This particular pair where a bit tight. Return was quick and easy.,3,0,5
I purchased these Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36 for my granddaughter for starting TRACK this spring 2021. I told her that I would be running and praying along with her every step she made.,5,1,5
"Super comfy!! Best walking shoes I‚Äôve ever had, worth the price. Supportive yet cushiony, which is important for me since I walk 6 miles almost every day.",5,1,5
"I'm training for a marathon and other shoes have hurt me in the past, but these are perfect for both comfort and larger toebox. I had the Pegasus 35s before and these are basically identical, just slightly newer design. Wonderful shoe and great colors!",5,1,5
"Annoyed to have waited and then get the wrong size. The box had a sticker that said it was an 8, but they are 8.5. Reordering and hoping for the correct size. I like the sneaker material and design.",1,0,5
I had previously gave this order a bad review after speaking with the seller of this product. I was totally wrong in my assumption of saying that they gym shoes were not authentic. They are and I apologize to the seller of this item. The shoes fit perfect and the sender was very easy to work with. He want beyond what he should have or had to in order to make sure that I the customer was satisfied and I am. I will be making future purchase with this seller.,5,1,5
Yessss!! I need something that's close to bare foot feeling. I so alot of hiit workouts and these are amazing. I will definitely be ordering another pair!,5,1,5
"I wear nothing but Nike Pegasus and formerly could put on a new pair without breaking them as well as using an orthopedic in them as well. For some reason, these feel much tighter. I make do by eliminating
The extra padding.",3,0,5
"Save your money. Not a genuine Nike shoe. Probably a knockoff, copy or second. Poor quality materials, design and construction. Fails poorly in comparison to genuine shoe I already had. Its a ripoff con job!",1,0,5
The shoe fits well and is comfortable. However the left tennis shoe is irregular/deformed with a buckle in the material near the ankle. I have taken a photo of right tennis shoe to show the difference.,2,0,5
"Go up a half size. I usually wear 8.5, I took a 9 and it fits perfectly. I love this shoe. It looks well made and of a high quality.",5,1,5
I like the sneakers. I was very surprised to see how thin the tongue is. So disappointing to have such a good sneaker with such a cheap tongue.,4,1,5
"Perfect fit, love the color and comfort!!! I workout every day and it‚Äôs very very important for me to have the perfect sneakers. I found them!",5,1,5
"I usually wear size 9 in sneakers (nike also), but these feel bigger, the style doesn't look very nice, it definitely wasn't a good buy.",2,0,5
"These fit true to size however, if you have a wider foot they might be snug. Nike tends to run that way though. My heels slip a bit but overall I am satisfied with these.",5,1,5
THE most comfortable shoes I have ever owned! Great for walking/jogging and seems to take pressure off you legs/back. I hate to take them off to go to bed!,5,1,5
"It is Nike. It is a good quality running shoes with extra comfort. The lylaic color is nice, too.",5,1,5
"Product is absolutely not what is pictured. There‚Äôs completely all black, no grey or teal!!! I am so disappointed.",1,0,5
I really like this running shoes. The only issue that I have is that the shoe is a little tight.,5,1,5
"My granddaughter is a collegiate soccer player, and running daily is a requirement. She loves these shoes!
Enough said!",5,1,5
"Love these shoes! They fit very light and comfortable and the pink is more neon than the picture shows, which I love!",5,1,5
"These were a gift for my granddaughter, who is an active young lady in sports and enjoys running. She really likes the comfortable fit of the shoe for walking, running, and playing sports. Therefore, I am quite satisfied.
Linda",5,1,5
"Super cute. I feel like they fit a tad wide. I have narrow feet & only wear Nike‚Äôs and these seem slightly wider than normal, but I still like them.",4,1,5
"The shoes themselves are great. But I have my concerns with the sellers. My shoes arrived appearing as if they had already been worn. The foam on the bottom was creased, shoelaces were re-laced, and shoe packing was outside of the shoe. I am still enjoying the shoes, but I wish the seller took more care with their products, especially if they are reselling returned items.",3,0,5
I'm on my feet all day and wanted a running shoe with support. I felt pretty satisfied with the overall support. It is a bit wider than most Nike shoes. Not happy that the rubber sole started to peel away from the toe within a few months of wear. The all-black version tended to hold up better.,3,0,5
"I have had several pair of these along with the Nike Vomero‚Äôs. These Pegasus are the most comfortable Nike‚Äôs .
The heel support/comfort is amazing for running or just working out.",5,1,5
I do physical work daily and need comfortable shoes and style. Love the color üòç,5,1,5
"But more than just the cute color, it‚Äôs a great fit and support. Comfortable from the very first day. They are great.",5,1,5
"These fit really well and the sole is comfortable. Sizing was normal for Nike and the price was less on amazon, what more can you ask for?",5,1,5
"This shoes are amazing. A friend of mine recommended me to buy them because they are very light and comfortable to wear and he didn‚Äôt lie at all. If you‚Äôre looking for shoes to run or walk, these are the best ones. I‚Äôve been wearing them every time I run and they are very soft on your feet. I definitely recommend it.",5,1,5
Not enough cushion in the front of the shoe where the ball of the foot is. Kind of disappointing for a running shoe.,3,0,5
"This original order did not state that these shoes were a Wide fitting. I only discovered this upon receipt of package and have returned them to Amazon.
Also did not ask for refund to be kept as a credit in my Amazon account which has been done without my permission.
I requested a full refund to my Visa credit card and this has not been done.",1,0,5
"I purchased these as a replacement for what I thought was an identical pair. However, these were not nearly as comfortable and seemed much more cheaply made. Nothing at all like the first pair I purchased.",1,0,5
"Best running shoe out there! I have a high arched foot and these running shoes have provided support during my daily 3-5 mile runs. These shoes are perfect for long distance running, sprints, and even at home workouts giving you the support and comfort you need on a daily basis. Definitely recommended üëçüèº",5,1,5
I am addicted to nike air zoom Pegasus and these are in my collection! Love them.,5,1,5
I hate the shortened tongue because it constantly folds down when I try to slip my foot into the shoe. But I love the textured shoelaces. They stay tied better.,3,0,5
"Love these! This is my second pair of Pegasus 36 sneaks. So comfortable, cool and supportive! Wore out in about a year 4-5 HIIT training and walking. Worth every penny!",5,1,5
"These feel really great on. They are super light weight, have lots of cushion and good ventilation.",5,1,5
"Love love love these shoes. The white is a little different than pictured, but the Nike check is on point.",5,1,5
The cloth is held together by glue near the front of the shoe where the shoe laces begin. They were shipped with wear-n-tear along that seam. Will not survive a couple of washes. Fit great even with my wife foot.,2,0,5
"These sneeke's fit PERFECTLY! I have a pair just like them , I purchased locally last year. When I saw these on Amazon I ordered them. The fit is perfect!",5,1,5
Tight at first but after a few walks very comfortable. Hopefully they hold up to my daily workout,3,0,5
"Comfortable. Easy to put on, laces haven‚Äôt come undone during a workout (a plus!). Pretty color.",5,1,5
I love Nike Pegasus- these are my 4th pair. However I had to exchange these- for an identical pair- due to the other ones had a defect with stitching coming undone at the tongue in both shoes.,4,1,5
"These shoes have a great fit, not too big in the foot bed, they are well cushioned and are well made. If you have a wider foot, you may not like these as much , but these are the pick for me! I hope they keep making this style. I love all the colors too, even though I ended up getting black. I'm hoping for something more fun for the summer!",5,1,5
Really love these shoes. I'm really picky about my shoes as I work 8 hr days on my feet and work out daily. Love these shoes for the comfort and support. Color is awesome.,5,1,5
Nike Air Pegasus is my favorite running show! I have been wearing them since the 1990‚Äôs! I‚Äôm so glad they still have them and keep coming up with new colors and designs.,5,1,5
"I love Nike and these sneakers did not disappoint! The tongue of the shoe is slanted so one side is higher than the other- I think it is cute but I didn't notice before purchasing. I am usually a size 8 but I am a size 9 in Nikes, so I purchased a size 9.",5,1,5
I wear a size 9 in Nike and these definetly run small...very disappointed : (,2,0,5
"Stylish, but not a lot of support.",4,1,5
One of the laces was longer than the other. Bummer but still a great shoe.,5,1,5
Muy c√≥modos y muy bonitos y la medida es la correcta,5,1,5
Love these sneakers! I am not a fan of Pegasus Air Zoom 37/38. I wish Nike just kept the 36 model. It's so well balanced!,5,1,5
Amazingly comfortable! They keep my feet perfectly balanced and prevent shin splints. These are the best running shoes I've had for over- supination.,5,1,5
Shoes were cute and comfortable! I would buy these shoes again :),5,1,5
Bought these for my wife for Christmas she loves them she is wearing them everywhere,5,1,5
It‚Äôs very comfortable and beautiful shoes. I love them!,5,1,5
Most comfortable shoe I‚Äôve ever worn,5,1,5
I by everything from Amazon - this purchase I was so excited about then shocked to find the shoes were laced and out of shape as I looked further the bottoms are dirty/ clearly worn. I purchased new shoes - shame on Amazon for selling me worn shoes‚Ä¶.what a disappointment,1,0,5
It's good just for running. Has no stability for gym Wright or cross training.,3,0,5
Did not fit. I wore this model for years. Left when it changed last year. Thought I‚Äôd try it again. The size I always wore is now too small and the ball of my foot hurts after only a few minutes on. Seems like a great show. Love the color! It‚Äôs just not the shoe for me anymore.,2,0,5
These are exactly what I wanted/needed. Fit perfect! Third Pair!,5,1,5
"These shoes are great for the average runner. They provide a good cushioning for support that you can feel, but aren‚Äôt too heavy. As a former long distance runner I‚Äôve tried a variety of shoes. This one is a good, average (neutral) shoe. I highly recommend!",5,1,5
"These shoes are great. They are really comfortable for casual wear, running and walking. I am not a real runner, but only casual short work-outs. They are great so far. I really like the tan colored sole that comes up to the toe-very cute.",5,1,5
"These are great looking running shoes, fit just as Nikes always do.",5,1,5
This was a gift to my partner. She says they fit fine and is happy with them.,5,1,5
No me resultaron c√≥modos,3,0,5
"my husband walks in the pool and loves these shoes! They fit his feet, which are sometimes difficult to fit, are flexible, and super comfortable",5,1,5
"Neutral, flexible, and ability to train effectively with feeling the road without too much spring cushioning that inhibits turning tight corners & working harder with speed interval work during short training runs. Too heavy for a racing flat but perfect combination of cushion and flexibility for an ideal training shoe. Lighter fabric (improvement: adds flexibility & more comfortable) on upper than previous model 35.",5,1,5
"Not as comfortable as the Pegasus 35 series, but just as light!! Good materials and the mint color is nice!",4,1,5
These were bought without trying on to replace my Nike Legend React - I‚Äôve been happy with them!!!,5,1,5
"No breaking in required. Very nice looking, too.",5,1,5
Very comfortable shoe. Great price. Quick delivery. I have two other pairs of this style. I absolutely love them. Lots of colors too to choose from.,5,1,5
Not enough support,1,0,5
"Perfect fit and very comfortable At this point, I would definitely rebuy.",5,1,5
These Nike Air Pegasus Zoom shoes fit like a glove! They are so well cushioned that I feel like bouncing when I am out walking my daily three miles. They are also a beautiful pale green/aqua with a grey Nike flourish. I am loving my shoes! Thank you.,5,1,5
"As described, so far good support for walking.",5,1,5
Very comfortable,5,1,5
"Absolutely horrible, one shoe was bigger than the other and felt lumpy. I did my research and glad some people got to enjoy them, I love the look but didnt fot rite.",1,0,5
"I like how clean these shoes look (I got the white with orange logo). They are a pretty shoe and I'm using them for indoor use only currently.

The shoes are super cush and comfy, which is why I buy Nike! They don't disappoint!",4,1,5
"shoes are comfortable, and lightweight. looks just like picture. i like the breathable fabric for summer. looks great on",5,1,5
I recommend trying on these shoes before purchase. I have one kid that loves the fit and another that hates them. I ordered a second pair for my kid that loves them and they showed up in new condition and a few days before the expected delivery.,5,1,5
"Yo lo utilizo para caminar pero el n√∫mero en este modelo me ha quedado holgado lo tengo que usar con medias deportivas un poco gruesas.
Con n√∫mero 9 pienso que hubiera quedado mejor.",5,1,5
"Bought for walking, I like the feel of the shoe--it is sturdy but not heavy. I wish the fabric on top was a bit thicker at the toe, but other than that I love them.",5,1,5
These run very large.,2,0,5
"I work standing and walking for 8 hours a day and needed a pair of shoes that would work for that and going to the gym. These are the perfect shoes for that! Will be ordering another pair when these wear out, I love them, super comfy",5,1,5
I‚Äôm in my feet all day and these are the most comfortable shoes!,5,1,5
They fit perfect and very light weight.,5,1,5
Si son muy buenos y c√≥modos,5,1,5
"Very cool‚Äîand fast‚Äîlooking but...the logos in the footbed make it uncomfortable without socks, my normal style. Makes the bottom of the foot stick to the shoe. Also, they‚Äôre a bit narrow and the upper shoe has to spread out",3,0,5
Nice shoes,5,1,5
"I'm thrilled to put them on. They are stylish, comfortable and propell me to move forward.",5,1,5
"Shoes were delivered without a shoebox, without tags, one of the laces is shredded, and there is dirt all over the soles. If I wanted used shoes, I‚Äôd buy used shoes for a used price. I won‚Äôt be ordered from this seller again.",1,0,5
Very comfortable and light in weight.. exactly what I was looking forüëç,5,1,5
They were not as comfortable as HOKA brand.,3,0,5

I love perfect for running,5,1,5
I‚Äôve only had the shoes a month I wear them less than three days a week and tread is peeling off on both shoes,1,0,5

I love the color and the fit is PERFECT!!!!,4,1,5
"Love these shoes! My 3rd pair. Great for wearing workouts, running and all day.",5,1,5
"Extremely comfortable, when standing for several hours!",5,1,5
"Unlike previous generations of Pegasus, these provide very little support. The style is nice and they are light weight, but not a good running shoe. Sad after more than a decade buying several pairs of Pegasus a year.",1,0,5
The pair I received the outer sole was gray and black not white according to the picture.,2,0,5
They aren't that comfortable. My Nike downshifted are way more comfortable and about $35 less expensive,1,0,5
Had to return because they DID NOT FIT. ran WAYYYY smaller than they should have.,1,0,5
These shoes don't provide as much ankle support as I hoped. Almost seem worn down.,3,0,5
"Ties too high on instep...
Very uncomfortable for running...",3,0,5
Great support! Fits my Good Feet inserts nicely !,5,1,5
"These shoes are fantastic. Easily my new favorite pair. They fit great, true to size. They're comfortable, great for working out or just as an every day shoe.",5,1,5
La talla perfecta. Es muy c√≥modo para correr o caminar. Me encantan.,5,1,5
"I loved them. So worth the price. I usually get the Air Max but it will be these from now on. I wear them for work and being in the medical field, you absolutely need support and comfort. A+ in all areas. Glad I chose them.",5,1,5

Love the color and the comfort! Fits true to size.,5,1,5

This was the wrong shoe or it doesn‚Äôt look anything like the picture. The shoe is all black,1,0,5
"I almost love this shoe, fits my foot well, good support. But not as much ball of my foot cushioning as the last pair of Zoom 36's",4,1,5
Comfortable,5,1,5

They're amazing. Just like the older Pegasus. Super comfortable and fit great!,5,1,5
Took me about a week to break in but are now my go to shoes for long nights of working on concrete floors.,5,1,5
I only buy Nike sneakers they last long and they have been the most comfortable. I must say these are the most uncomfortable sneakers I have ever worn. Disappointed,1,0,5
fits perfectly,5,1,5
The new design causes your ankle to be pushed forward causing pain in a Achilles.,2,0,5
Great exercise shoe. The fit is comfortable but supportive. The fabric is light and forgiving( for those of us with bunions). The shoe tongue is minimal so it doesn‚Äôt interfere with your foot motion. I am very pleased with this purchase!,5,1,5
Great product!,5,1,5
"I loved an older version of this shoe, and it held up well with time. I love the feel and fit. However, I‚Äôm extremely disappointed that this time around they is falling apart after only six weeks.",1,0,5
This version of the Pegasus is awful. Nike killed a great running sneaker.,1,0,5
fit is perfect and very comfortable,4,1,5
My fianc√© loves the way they fit and says that they‚Äôre her most comfortable pair of running shoes.,5,1,5
Exactly what my granddaughter wanted. Good quality.,5,1,5
These shoes are amazing. I was getting foot pain and having been stressed about getting new shoes because I have low arches. I immediately noticed a difference in my run and was pain free during the first use.,5,1,5
"I like the color, and they fit fine. I'm brand loyal to the Nike Air brand. But these are just so-so. For the price, I should feel like I'm walking on clouds. I do not.",3,0,5
Excellent running shoes. Good fit and great support.,5,1,5
The shoes flattens my feet and sometimes causes my feet to cramp which is very annoying and utterly painful.,2,0,5
Very comfortable and great for running,5,1,5
"Comfortable with no foot pain by the end of the day. Nothing compared to my Adidas, but they are pretty close!",4,1,5
"Overall fit well but the back kept slipping no matter how Much I adjusted the laces. I also have a high arch and didn‚Äôt feel like there was enough support. These may be better for a casual sneaker, but not for running",3,0,5
"Shoes were just as I expected. I have problems with my feet, so I had to return them because they just didn't fit right.
Arrived on time, perfect condition.",5,1,5
I have a similar pair a half size smaller and this pair is much more comfortable for me in doing cardio. Better room in the front for my toes.,5,1,5
Me quedo grande. Ordene un 37.5 y tendria que haber pedido 37. El calzado es ultraliviano y buena amortiguacion.,4,1,5
I have worn the same size in Nike (regardless of style) since high school and these were way too small. Had to return.,1,0,5
"This my second time to purchase these Nikes. I wore the other ones out unfortunately! They look really good on as well as are highly, highly functional.",5,1,5
Bellos,5,1,5

Terrible shoe. the sole fell apart in less than 2 months.,1,0,5
It was very light and comfortable but I was looking for something with more sturdiness.,4,1,5
These are my third pair of Nike Pegasus. They fit and feel perfect for everyday running,5,1,5
These are cute. But when I run/walk my toes are push together and I‚Äôm flat footed and no arch support,3,0,5
"Bought as a gift for my partner. He loves them and just ran his best ever half marathon time, so they must be good! PS. Nikes are just amazing, I still have an old old pair that just refuse to die.",5,1,5
Luv everything about them!!,5,1,5
For working out and spinning,5,1,5
they are very comfortable,5,1,5
I was excited to get these shows for support. They were recommended. They hurt my heal. A little too narrow for me and the support isn't what I need.,3,0,5
The shoes was as described. Was received and a very timely matter. Would order from this person again!,5,1,5
The sizing on these is not true to Nike standards. I bought a pair from Nike.com and they were correct.,1,0,5

"This was my first real shoe investment getting back into running as an adult (ran cross country in high school years ago but was out of practice). I typically do light 3-5mi runs, at high altitude/mountainous terrain and wanted something that could help with fatigue as I got back into shape. Bought these in a fancy running store, they came highly recommended by one of the staff and I can see why. Great running shoes, light and breathable. Just wore them today running in the snow, they worked fine with wool socks and a pair of yak trax, but did get a little wet after a while. I'm investing in the waterproof shield version next for those wet cold runs!",5,1,5
"These are not the same as the original Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36 produced by Nike. The tongue is sewed so that you can't move it, and the cushioning is inferior. The price when you finally order turns out to be an outrageous $150. They won't fool me again.",1,0,5
"HI! I am division 1 cross country/track runner and run between 60-70 miles per week (ps this is my dads account but I am a girl) (and I also have flat feet and custom orthodics) and the zoom peg 36‚Äôs are not the move in my opinion, I LOVE my 34‚Äôs and continue to buy 34‚Äôs! The 36 feels cheap and I do NOT recommend for distance running:( I will be returning mine and getting my 34s again, also I have custom orthodox and the 36 still felt so unstable",1,0,5
"I bought these as I have a pair from a few years back and still wear those. With these newer model, I developed plantar fasciitis and these do not help with my feet supination. They feel good initially but they are not good for me. Its too bad because I really like the way they look.",2,0,5
"The shoe is entirely black - no white, no blue. It is very comfortable, but not what I ordered based on the picture",2,0,5
"They look nice but something is not right about the fit in the back of the shoes. They don‚Äôt hug my heels like sneakers should so when I walk around in them, I constantly feel as if my heels are going to slide right out of the shoes. I have to wear longer socks than I normally would to keep them from sliding off my feet in the shoes. If I had the patience to deal with returning them I would. Other than that, they look nice and they are comfortable. I probably won‚Äôt be wearing them often though because the heels are so annoying.",3,0,5
"NIKE has changed Pegasus. The arch is way too forward and vey thick. I am a size 7 and buy size 8.
In the past, they have designated this shoe type as running with perfect arch, not pronators and not too thick.
Now they fit like a Rebock which are too thin for me.
I returned them.",2,0,5
Fits true to size! Super comfortable for walking- haven‚Äôt run more than 10 miles on them yet so can‚Äôt speak to breaking in for running but love them so far!,5,1,5
These sneakers gave me plantar fasciitis. The heel is poorly designed. The laces are skimpy. Kept switching off to my other Nikes & only these hurt my feet. Waste of my money. Unwearable.,1,0,5
I bought this as a gift for my gf and clicked the gif wrapping option. Everything came perfectly and she loved it. These shoes are ~$50 more straight off of Nike.com so I am very pleased,5,1,5
"The both people I I ordered them for, just love them. So comfortable like walking on air.",5,1,5
"I wear size 39, but its tight on me . Uk should be 8.5 but this shoes showed 8. I threw the shoes away. Unsatisfied",1,0,5
"Used these for working out, power walking, and at work. Great support for long days on my feet.",5,1,5
"I am in love with these sneakers, got 2 pairs and going to get another. Very comfortable.",5,1,5
"Bought the pink size 8 normal shoe size is 7.5, 8 is a perfect fit. Very comfortable and thick insole.",5,1,5
Perfect for working out!,5,1,5
"I am a Nike shoe fan and have been in the Pegasus for at least 3 versions now, maybe four. This one, the 36, is my least favorite. The sole and cushion are reliable and what I don‚Äôt like is the upper material. It‚Äôs extremely stretchy and flexible, providing barely any protection from rolling an ankle. This makes it strictly a running shoe, unfit for cross training or any movement side to side. Be careful hopping up curbs or aside of a puddle!",3,0,5
I love these so much! They are perfect for running! I tend to have problems with knees and ankles but these help a lot and they fit me perfectly! I just ordered my normal size,5,1,5
Very comfy and has a lot of cushion. Perfect for running.,5,1,5
"I ran track and cross country in high school and own about 8 pairs of the exact same shoe-- just in different colors. Sadly, Nike quit making the shoe I had fallen in love with so I had to find a new pair. I didn't want to spend a fortune on running shoes, so when I came across these I was intrigued. I love them. The support is great and they match everything with the neutral colors. I wear these shoes to workout or run as well as wearing them to most everyday occasions. Great pair of shoes!!!",5,1,5
"I bought these because the were on sale. I‚Äôve had these shoes before and they are so amazing! I have back and hip pain from sitting at my desk job. As a runner, I‚Äôve worn so many running shoes over the years. I‚Äôve paid $160 or more for Brooks, new balance, ASICS and other Nike but these are my favorite! Great cushion and great heel support that helps relive that lower back pain. I recommend going a 1/2 size up with Nike.",5,1,5
"I love these ! Fit is A+, perfect for running. Worth it. I have always stuck with the Nike brand. Comfort and superiority.",5,1,5
These are so comfortable and correct my supination while walking/running- exactly what I want them to do!,5,1,5
Nike women‚Äôs air Pegasus are the best! Been running in them for 45 years. They just keep getting better,5,1,5
"Cute shoes, but the arch felt weird for some reason. Had to return. Refund has not been issued and it‚Äôs been over 2 weeks.",3,0,5
"Mine just arrived today and was actually expecting for it to arrive with its box but instead it just came in in a plastic. That part disappointed me because I like to keep my shoes inside their box when I‚Äôm not using them or simply just for decoration purposes. Other than that, the shoes overall is great and it is very light which makes it great for running.",4,1,5
Highly recommend. My sister is a nurse and works long hours. She can work her shift and still the shoes provide support and comfort.,5,1,5
I've bought three pairs of this sneaker and I love them for walking. Very comfortable and enough support for me.,5,1,5
I love how comfortable they are. Im happy i bought them.,5,1,5

These shoes were very comfortable and are great for working out. The only thing was that they were just a bit too narrow. I'll probably buy another pair that are quite wider.,4,1,5
"I bought these shoes for daily running, they arrived in perfect conditions and earlier than expected. They are very light and comfortable, it feels like flying. I have a skinny foot and normally have a 37 EU size here I bought the 38.5 and they fit perfectly. Really happy",5,1,5
"I love these! Extremely comfortable, very light weight. And really nice looking running shoes.",5,1,5
The Nike Pegasus Zoom 36 fit extremely well and are very comfortable. I have already run many miles in them.,5,1,5

"One of the best things about Nike Pegasus shoes is that they always fit the same. Each year when I buy a new pair, they fit just like the old ones so there is never a problem ""wearing them in."" I love the bright colour too!",5,1,5
Very comfortable . Quite happy with the shoe .,4,1,5
"Best running shoe ever, super light nice fit, true to size, simply AMAZING!!! I am so happy",5,1,5
"Shoe not comfortable, very wide fit. Not comfortable for any distance use. Very unsatisfactory quality for a Nike shoe. Not their typical fit",1,0,5
A Quality Product,5,1,5
"DO NOT BUY THESE!!! I've had these shoes for a few months now, and I needed to buy work shoes. So I went into the store and saw the ""same "" pair of Nike Tanjun sneakers...the ones I bought online are fakes. Don't buy them! They are way more expensive, have a fake sole that are supposed to be a squishy memory foam material, and they fall apart after being used for a few short months. Not happy with this product!",1,0,5
"I usually don‚Äôt purchase Nike‚Äôs because I‚Äôd never found a pair with the arch support I need. These are different; they are so comfortable and provide great support for my feet. The shoes are solid, while also being breathable. A+.",5,1,5
"These shoes fit as expected. They are very comfortable and very lightweight. Brand new, they were very stylish. I really enjoyed the shoes. That being said,

I bought these for work. I'm in IT and our floors are concrete. If I walk in the city for lunch, it's less than 1mile a day on sidewalk, if at all.

After about 5 months of daily semi-daily wear to work (where I mostly sit down), the tread on the bottom of these shoes disappeared. The lightweight effect is a trade-off for durable tread.

Nike's shoes made for walking/running never did this to me (except for long distance hikes for 1-2 years). I was walking on the sidewalk a morning after rain the night before and fell flat on my ass! The tread is mostly worn off the in the parts where there is 0 visible remaining tread, there are actually divers which I believe are capable of growing into actual holes.

Overall, I liked the shoes, but considering I didn't put a lot of miles on them, I would have liked to get more than 5 months for a $60 pair of shoes.",3,0,5
"I work in retail and stand/walk for 8-hour shifts. I tried all kinds of shoes (including other Nikes) and different shoe inserts to help ease the pain in my feet at the end of the day. These shoes feel like like walking on a cloud! My feet don‚Äôt hurt at the end of the day, and I don‚Äôt have to wear ugly orthopedic shoes. These are great looking and functional. If you have foot pain like I do from being on your feet all day, BUY THESE SHOES.",5,1,5
I had purchased Nike tanjuns before and absolutely loved them. I was a little worried about purchasing them online but they are the real deal! They are so comfy and the perfect workout sneaker. So happy and they are gorgeous,5,1,5
"So comfortable and stylish for hip hop dance class!!! Good support and they feel really light weight which is nice!!! I love them! I am a 7, and very true to size!",5,1,5
"I am very disappointed with these shoes. I purchased them for my son‚Äôs school uniform for Pre-K3 and there were holes in the toes within weeks (I had to throw them away before the second month of school started). Unfortunately, I had already purchased a second pair in the next size, and the same thing happened with the second pair. Kids are active and hard on shoes, but for the price, I would expect a better quality shoe.",1,0,5
"Shoes were cute, ordered to size chart, shoe was still too small. If you plan on ordering, order at least a size and a half bigger. If it doesn‚Äôt come in half sizes than two sizes bigger. I tried to exchange shoe size for a bigger size, the seller had extremely poor customer service and never got back to myself or amazon for that matter. My best suggestion is order from somewhere else or make sure you‚Äôre spot on about the size you‚Äôre ordering. Basically, as it stands I‚Äôm stuck with a shoe that doesn‚Äôt fit my toddler. Good luck!",1,0,5
"I purchased these to replace my work shoes. I wore the Downshifter line, however they have stopped making them. I looked for a shoe similar in style and fit to the Downshifters. The Tanjuns were awful, I felt like my foot had been walking on a flat surface all day. I believe it‚Äôs due to no rubber tread at the bottom. I ordered the Pegasus‚Äô after 1 time of wearing the Tanjuns. The Pegasus‚Äô are so comfortable, with lots of padded and rubber support, as well as curvature. They were comfortable on the first day, no need for a ‚Äúbreak in‚Äù period. Unfortunately after wearing these once, I will be throwing them away. I can‚Äôt return them because the bottom doesn‚Äôt have any rubber sole, it‚Äôs completely white/sponge material, so they look worn after one occasion. I would recommend spending the extra money and getting the Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36.",2,0,5
"This is a fantastic pair of shoes!! As a college student, $90 was a bit much to drop for a pair of shoes, but the price is definitely worth it!!",5,1,5
"Most of my shoes are and have been Nike and I've never had an issue until this pair. Most of the time I pick up the previous year's style for around $60 to $100.

I picked up this pair to keep at work to go out and get some steps in... fifteen minutes here and there. The first thing I noticed was that there was no arch support. No biggie, I'm not running a marathon. After I couple of walks I notice my left knee has a slight pain. A few more walks later I realize that the left shoe rolls out from under my foot and my over correction is what is putting extra strain on my knee.

At this point, only wearing the shoes maybe two dozen times or so, while holding the shoe upside down you can see why my foot is rolling inwards

All the time I try to tell my mom she needs to buy better quality shoes, that if you take care of your feet they will take care of you. I guess karma got me! I tried to save $20 and probably got the one pair with a defect... or did I?",1,0,5
"These are my favorite Nikes and I have 3 pairs. One is a women‚Äôs 7.5 and the others are boy‚Äôs 5.5. They all fit the same ( I think Nike runs small and I have wide feet, so I get a half size up). The fabric is stretchy and these are so easy to machine wash. I wear them to work often and they hold up well. I work in retail full time and I‚Äôm on my feet 8-12 hours daily. I‚Äôm also in my 40‚Äôs with heel spurs and sciatica. Good shoes are life changing!",5,1,5
"I needed a new pair of running shoes and saw all the high reviews on this Nike shoe. The high reviews plus the affordable price for me sold on this shoe. I typically buy a half size larger due to the fact of my feet swelling while I run. I will say I felt like I was running on pillows. The shoes are som comfortable for running, I felt like I could run for hours. The only thing I would suggest is buying a half size larger because they do run a tad bit small. Other than that I have no complaints. I have to update my review. At first these running shoes were som comfortable, however since using these new pair of shoes, I‚Äôve had constant problems with my ankles,, and toes going numb. If you have wider feet, I DO NOT recommend this shoe. Waste of my money",2,0,5
"Oh my gosh, I work by walking and standing on a cement floor and after trying numerous pairs of sneakers and walking shoes I have finally found the BEST and MOST COMFORTABLE SHOE ever. In fact, several others where I am employed are purchasing the same shoe and finding the same comfort that I experience everyday. No knee pain, no lower back pain..BEST SHOES EVER!!!",5,1,5
"UPDATE: Fantastic for walking!

I love the fit and the feel of this sneaker. It is light and flexible and yet still they feel very supportive. I purchased these for an upcoming trip to Berlin where I anticipate a lot of walking so I will updated it when I get back. But based on the feel so and look so far I love it.

The white on white is super minimalist which allows it to be super versatile. I‚Äôm planning on bring only one other pair of shoes.",5,1,5
"I was trying to find a running shoe with arch support but these have absolutely none, as they are all fashion and no function. The footbed is hard and flat as a board (see pics). If anything they make your foot overpronate because the inside arc of the outer shoe is fashionably carved out. They are cute but I would mess up my feet pretty bad running in these. Mine also came with a perforation in the toe area so I‚Äôll probably end up returning. Not the quality of ‚Äúrunning shoe‚Äù one would expect after dropping $80.",2,0,5
"I‚Äôm conflicted over these shoes. They look nice and they fit my 13 year old well (size 7.5) but the toe and top of foot area has no support at all. It‚Äôs just a thin material with the netting on top so these are good for light wear like school or leisurely walking but not for anything more than that as they won‚Äôt protect that area at all if something falls on it.
Of course they‚Äôre not supposed to be steel toe quality but this is the thinnest I‚Äôve ever seen in an athletic shoe for any of my family and this is Nike. I would expect better quality than this.
Also, whoever designed this paper thin butterfly wing tongue design WITH breathable basketball short type holes throughout the whole middle needs to be fired. It‚Äôs terrible. It‚Äôs too hard to pull up and keep in place with your hand while trying to hold onto the back of the shoe to slip onto your foot. And like I said, it‚Äôs paper thin so I suspect it will rip in the weaker side areas way before the rest of the shoe wears out which in turn, will render the shoes completely useless and unwearable.

He says he will keep them because he likes the color and fit but I really feel like I will have to be replacing them within a few months whereas his usual Nike that I buy lasts him a complete school year.
Not worth the $60 price tag on them at all! Not even close!!
Shop for a different shoe!",2,0,5
"As someone with wide feet it‚Äôs hard to find cute good quality walking shoes. I bought this in my usual size 9 W wide width and to compare I got the asics gel excite 7 since that brand is known for fitting wide feet comfortably. The nikes were comfortable straight out of the box, but I could feel the side of my foot already stretching over the edge of the footbed. The material is quite breathable and stretchy so I‚Äôm not sure how long it‚Äôll take for me to wear down the sides. Also in the inside heel portion of the shoe insert just seems like it‚Äôll give out and become loose. Overall it‚Äôs a good casual shoe, I wouldn‚Äôt run or go long distances with these and expect them to hold up for a long time. They are as advertised a good casual shoe to run errands. The ASICS have a sturdier exterior, not much stretch but they do fit my wide feet comfortably. I feel secure when walking/ jogging. If you have wide feet and want something casual then the Nikes are great. For more athletic shoes go with ASICS. They‚Äôre not as cute as these Nikes but your feet will thank you.",3,0,5
"Soo bad. Never buying Nike again. The bottom is made out of some sort of foam and all of the tread wore off in a couple months with moderate use. The grip is comically bad when the ground is a little wet- it's like walking on ice. It also let's water in with no resistance at all, and doesn't let the water back out. It's very lightweight, however because it's made of just foam and cheap mesh. I'm sticking to Asics.",1,0,5
"I would have rated these a 5 star however the shipping took a very long time especially since I paid additional shipping costs since this seller does not offer the amazon free shipping but instead charges additional shipping and handling. I paid the additional shipping charges March 1st and STILL did NOT receive them until today March 17th. Too long and should include free shipping because of the time involved sending and receiving them. They are quite nice Authentic and very comfortable as well as true to size . These really are a quality product you can use for everyday, including errands, walking (exercise), working out at gym or home but not for running or jogging. I will follow up in a few months on the durability and if these are still comfortable. They are SO lightweight on your feet which is quite nice on a busy day. Enjoy!",3,0,5
These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn! It's like walking on marshmallows. I actually have no more foot pain during the day...I believe I can walk miles and miles without sore feet. I'm hooked and will probably be buying in many colors. SOOO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,5,1,5
Really great shoes except for the security sensor still attached. The box was also torn and held together with a rubber band. It kind of makes me wonder if these were stolen and being resold. Sketchy. The shoes themselves are great other than the sensor. They are comfortable and super light. I am in need of them now so I guess I‚Äôll try to get the sensor off.,3,0,5
"I LIVE in these sneakers. Never have I owned sneakers with zero break-in time. NONE at all.
I walk 6-8 miles a day and they are terrific. No foot pain anywhere, no tiredness, great level of comfort and support.

My 2 issues are
1. (A petty whine here) Laces are soooooo long.
2. (bigger issue) They wear out in about a month for me. I have bought 4 pairs since May (just started on pair 4). I noticed the circular rubber grips on the sole begin to wear in 3 days and are totally gone/flat in week 3-4. Gone. Completely. Smooth as a baby‚Äôs bottom. That‚Äôs about 150 miles so I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs my regiment and not the shoes, per se. Still, $65 a month on walking/running sneakers is steep.
The immediate comfort is worth it to me because I have a huge issue with blisters. As a woman with a wider foot from a severe break years ago, I order a men‚Äôs size 8. They fit tightly from the padding for the first 10 miles and then get relaxed inside but don‚Äôt order up - you‚Äôll be sliding around in them.

My son has very thin feet and wears a woman‚Äôs 12.",4,1,5
"i‚Äôm super disappointed. these shoes are very narrow and small. my shoe size is an 8.5, always dead on, and so i ordered an 8.5 and unfortunately they were too small and tight. there was also a ridge on the instep sean (right under the arch) and it was really uncomfortable to walk on. i submitted a return. if you have narrow feet, order a half size up and these will probably work fine for you. they were awful for me.

the design is darling (i ordered the black with rose gold detail) and i sooo wish they‚Äôd worked for me. looks just like the image. arrived on time as well, just terribly sized.

also - i went to a local dsw and found this same shoe (same price) and tried it on in a 9 just for kicks.. the toe area was more acceptable, however there was still an uncomfortable ridge on the instep.",2,0,5
"These shoes are soooo comfy! They are flexible and have good support. Great for running around or gym use. They don‚Äôt rub wrong against the ankle and are super cute! I walk dogs for a living so they will be a great addition to my work life! Might even order a second pair in a different color!!! I wear a 10-11 depending on brand, ordered a 10.5 and they fit perfectly! Have average width feet.",5,1,5
These shoes came through I work for amazon and on my feet for at least 11 hours a day. Feet feel so much better with these shoes. But I also wear compression socks. The combination is magic. I love these shoes. And they don‚Äôt look to bad either being that I‚Äôm a shoe fan. Forget looking cute. My feet where killing me. I wanted to quit on many occasions cause the pain was so bad. But now I‚Äôm walking on clouds. Definitely a must buy.,5,1,5
"These are my everyday, go-to sneakers. Lightweight and super comfortable, but the sizing is quirky. I normally wear a 7 1/2 shoe with stockings or bare feet. I always buy Nike sneakers in a size 8 to accommodate my socks, but I had to buy these sneakers in an 8 1/2 because the fabric in the toe box upper is too snug.

I bought these sneakers in the usual half size larger. Although they were fine in the store, I was never able to fully enjoy them at home. I gave away my hardly ever used Tanjuns. If your toes need wiggle room, get these sneakers in a full size larger than your shoes.",5,1,5
I wear a women‚Äôs size 8 but always purchase big kids size 7 in Nike because they are significantly less expensive. I love this brand! This is my 4th pair and the color on these is a bright coral but not too neon. I would say they are good for walking and everyday wear but not running. No heel rub and my arch is supported.,5,1,5
"Well I am usually not a fan of athletic shoes because I feel my feet ‚Äòcan‚Äôt breathe‚Äô. I live in Florida and am used to wearing sandals however I joined the gym and closed toe shoes are a requirement. My granddaughter suggested I buy these shoes because of the mesh uppers, being lightweight and offering good support. Well she was right on all accounts. They are so comfortable and my foot does not feel restricted. I ordered my son a black pair, however the have not arrived yet. He is usually a Reebok man however I bet he will love these shoes,",5,1,5
"Weirdest shoes I‚Äôve tried; too short but too wide. I work retail and have feet problems, I found these on a top ten list for workers and decided to give them a try. Feet hurt just as bad, if not worse. No arch support.
The bottoms were light and not heavy, but felt like I was standing on that unstable green florist styrofoam (almost rolled my ankles a few times)
Gave them three days then sent back.",2,0,5
"Love the look and fit of these shoes and the fact that they're light weight/cool. However, within a week of wearing them I can see major wear on the toes of the shoes. My son is and 8 y/o, but this is the first Nike (or other shoe brand) that has fallen apart so quickly.",3,0,5
"The shoes look fine and as if they have never been worn before, but did not arrive in a Nike shoebox. They were just placed inside the shipping box by themselves, so I am not sure they actually came from Nike. I was planning to give them as a gift, so certainly would have preferred to present them in an official Nike shoebox.",1,0,5
"Finally got around to replacing my Nikes that had holes in them. This pair is perfect! (I would hope so seeing as it's the exact same thing as my old pair, just in a different color). I was SUPER nervous when I was tracking the shipping though, as the product image was the all black pair but the image on the shipping screen was the black pair with white details. However, the all black pair that I wanted is. what arrived!",5,1,5
"I am extremely pleased with the delivery and the product! These shoes have saved my life! I work part-time for a network and several times per year we have to work at different shows. Well, I have tried every show from less expensive to very expensive and by day two and definitely by day 4 (because of the extended walking and standing required) my feet and legs hurt so bad that I wanted to cut my legs off at the knee and sit them on the side! Lol. I am literally on my feet for 8-16 hours per day!
So, I went online and typed ‚Äúmost comfortable Nike shoe,‚Äù and this one popped up, and the reviews were on target! I can honestly say that these are the most comfortable shoe I could have ever purchased! The only thing I would mention is that they run about a 1/2-1 size too small. I purchased the first pair from Nike and when I went back to purchase a larger size they were out of stock. Fortunately they were available from another vendor and I was able to get them delivered before I left for my trip.",5,1,5
these shoes were fakes! They came without tags in a plain brown unbranded box. After receiving them I did so research and realized I had been scammed. To top it off about 3 days later I became the victim of a Brushing scam with products sold on amazon. My suspicion is that this seller was involved.,1,0,5
"First of all they were way too small. My daughter normally wears a size 8. Ordered an 8 and they smashed her toes. Went to go return them (following the Amazon return process) and it costs me $26 to ship them back from the states. Yes, $26. I had to return something that didn't even fit because they can't get their sizing right. Total joke!!!!",1,0,5
I bought these for cute work out shoes but then brought them to wear after work one day and OMG. these are the most comfortable shoe to put on. I have plantar fasciitis but am also a server. So by the end of shifts sometimes my feet hurt so bad. I even have dr.schols work shoes but OMG putting these on after was heaven. And they are hella cute! I want all the colors,5,1,5
These are FAKE!!!. Bought twice and both times they got a hole within one month of daily wear in the toe of the shoe. See photos. Also inside they wore through and had pieces sticking out.. I loved the rose gold swoosh and had an original/real pair that lasted over 18 months or longer with no issues - which I bought from Academy. Went back to Academy to buy just all black (as rose gold no longer available) and they are the real deal. Be aware these will not last like true Nikes.,1,0,5
"Not a bad shoe except the soles became detached after less than 4 months use. Unless you feel like buying new shoes every 3 months or so, DO NOT buy these.",1,0,5
"I purchased these shoes at last minute for a trip that involved a lot of walking, 100 miles+ over several weeks.
These shoes are FANTASTIC, comfortable (I used additional arch support), durable and look good.
If you are looking for excellent walking shoes, you found them.",5,1,5
"This is my second pair of that exact same color. The first pair lasted me about a year or two with heavy everyday use. It's a classic look and pairs well with many outfits. The shoes are comfortable to walk in and are super lightweight.

I also have this same style of Nike's in white and another in grey. I'm a big fan.",5,1,5
"The outside packaging was in very good shape; however, the shoe box was completely ripped apart and held together with a rubber band. It appeared that the shoes were not of ""store quality.""",1,0,5
"Wrong color, too big and quality seems sketchy. Not comfortable and well made like Nikes Ive had before. Very disappointed. Sticker with the color combo I specified was slapped over the original sticker which reflected what was in the box.",1,0,5
"When I received this, of course I thought I was buying NEW for the price!!!!!
The box was damaged, rubber and around it..now mind you, this box was sitting in another box! (So not the cause of shipping!)
One Shoe lace all untied as if someone had worn it. Other shoe it was tied.
The bottom of the shoe you could tell it had been walked in.
I just wished if things are used, STOP charging so dam much, AND let a person know!!!!!",2,0,5
"These are THE MOST comfortable shoes EVER! It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre walking on clouds! I‚Äôm between a 6.5 - 7 & it was recommended to get the 7‚Äôs & I‚Äôm SO GLAD I did! They don‚Äôt rub the back of my ankles like other shoes do, and I managed to keep them on the entire day!! The netting that the shoe is made of actually ventilates air on to your feet!! You just can‚Äôt go wrong with these shoes!! Who doesn‚Äôt want STYLE ~ COMFORT & TONS OF COMPLIMENTS!!?? :)",5,1,5
"I bought these because they are light weight and breathable . I Just starting wearing them for indoor Pickleball and pleased because they are indeed light weight NOT not clunky. I‚Äôve switched from Asics which are all now heavy , clunky and aren‚Äôt good for competitive sports",5,1,5
"I love these shoes so much. Not only are they cute and stylish, but I've never had any foot pain when I wear them. I tend to go on 2-4 mile walks and these hold up and protect my feet from getting sore. I will definitely order another pair in the future! Well worth the price.",5,1,5
"I ordered Nike Women's Tanjun Running Shoes for my daughter who works as a trainer at a gym. She is a wee snobbish (understatement) about the athletic shoes she will place on her size 9 princess feet. Alas, Cinderella says Nike Women's Tanjun Running Shoes are way comfier than glass slippers.",5,1,5
"The bottom around the toe came apart after a few wears (maybe 3-4 times). Since it wasn't new, I could return. Super glue fixed it.

Fit a little tight in length and width. The arch support isnt great. Seems like you sink into the memory foam and then there is no support. As a person with arch problems, I couldn't wear them for walking, whichnis why I got them.",2,0,5
Not as advertised. Photo was black on black with white sole. I received black with white Nike and white sole. Which sucks since I already own that pair. Wanted black on black with white sole. These are very comfortable great shoes just didn‚Äôt receive color scheme as pictured in photo. PITA,4,1,5
bought a 7EE and a 6.5 reg width for comparison and because the EE only comes in black. SAME FOOTBED AND SOLE! but the extra wide had more mesh upper material and was significantly roomier. keeping both cuz they are cute but the EE more tolerable and accomodated a bunion. had to break them in for a day or so but good shoe for nike which does not cater to special orthopedic needs. these are the only nike shoes i can wear comfortably.,4,1,5
"My son really loved these shoes. They were very comfortable and probably still are to him. It's only been a month or so since we got them. Today I just happen to look down and see them fraying at the seems. The sole was peeling off as well. I have to say, this is a record for shoes being wore out so quickly. Lesson learned...read the negative reviews and not just the positive ones.",2,0,5
Great pair of shoes but I suggest getting them from a different seller. These arrived loose in a bag not in its original box. Had these been a gift id have been livid. I was lucky and they arrived undamaged but it could have easily turned out worse.,3,0,5
"Soooo comfy! The first pair of shoes I have worn that were comfortable from the second I stepped into them! Great breath ability too. I have very wide feet, high arches and insteps. Nike shoes NEVER fit me properly because they usually have a very narrow toe box. I ordered the extra wide (2E) and they don't need to be broken in or worn a few days to feel good. They are the best tennis shoes I think I have ever worn!!!",5,1,5
Initial order shoe had ink tag still attached. Returned and replacement shipped right out. The show is comfortable from the get go and well made. Must run a bit on the short side so ordered a half size up which is perfect for my orthotics. I highly recommend this shoe and this seller!!,5,1,5
"I love these shoes. I buy the same style over and over for running. Light weight and cute, come in many different colors. The only down fall would be the lack of arch support. I wear with inserts so I don't have any problem, I want to make clear that I do not give the arch support 5 stars.",5,1,5
"Purchased a pair of these in black on black and loved them so much so I ordered these. The tongue on these is a bit more flimsy than the black ones I have but they are soft, light, and comfortable beyond belief. They feel like an extension of my own foot. I‚Äôm pretty active working out 3-4x a week with a trainer and walking or jogging 2 miles a day. They‚Äôve held up well and with my job as a nurse doing 7-10k steps a night, my feet feel good at the end of my shift. I wear a 7.5 and have always worn 8‚Äôs because I thought I needed extra room for swelling after my shift but the 7.5 is perfect. Feels like a sock!!",5,1,5
"These are one pair of good looking shoes that skimp in the they-feel-like-a-well-made-product department. Some of what was subtracted to makes these shoes light weight, and they are that, compromises my three stars rating so I should stop writing before I change it to two.",3,0,5
"I purchased these shoes based totally on reviews , and I am so glad i did. I have had 8 Achilles tendon surgeries on right foot and needed comfort and stability for walking. I usually wear padded slippers all day due to shoes rubbing on Achilles tendon causing excruciating pain. These shoes fit perfectly and the comfort is beyond anything I expected especially with my injury. From the moment I put these on I was in love. I will never buy another brand of tennis shoes this is my go to shoe. Please try for yourself as you can return if unsatisfied.",5,1,5
I purchased a pair from Kohls but then saw Amazon sold for a cheaper price. I bought these taking a risk of receiving fakes. Once these arrived in the mail I compared them and scrutinized every bit of detail to the ones from Kohls. My conclusion is that these are 100% real and not fakes at all. For the price it's a great deal! A plus to this was the shoes came brand new. Bottom of shoes were completely white.,5,1,5
Great tennis shoes! I bought these for my daughter to wear at college and she absolutely loves them. Her foot runs narrow and even though these do not come and narrow she felt that they fit a bit better than other Nikes she has had,5,1,5
"I got these for my daughter, she is a college and walks a lot for school and her job. She really likes the comfort and the feel of these sneakers. She likes how light weight they are and how they take the impact away from when she has to stand in one spot for a while. She would highly recommend them.
PS she also likes the style!!!!",5,1,5
"I read an article that these were great for people who stand all day and provides good support, and they've done exactly that. I took out the insoles and put in my orthotics and they've been great for walking and standing. Highly recommend.",5,1,5
Ordered black with white swish for my son. His current shoes were size 11 and he were starting to get a little tight and worn so I ordered a size 12. They are smaller than his size 11 shoes! Unfortunately I can no longer get another pair in a bigger size.,2,0,5
My daughter loves these. VERY lightweight she said feels like nothing on her feet! The black part of the shoe is actually mesh. So the entire shoe is mesh to air out feet!,5,1,5
"Dude, I bought these to work out, which I haven't really gotten around to yet, but I'd ordered another pair of dress shoes along with them, and I walk quite a bit, so they made my heels hurt, and I got shin splints. So I decided to wear these for a more casual occasion, and they are so comfortable! I'd been wearing dress shoes for like two years straight, walking miles a day, and these made such a difference. They're also pretty cute! I work at a hotel, and they didn't seem too out of place with my uniform, and I've gotten a lot of compliments!",5,1,5
"I have bought this style of Nikes at least 5 times, always 7.5. These ones are so tight even my toes hurt. After wearing them for three days, my feet hurt more than wearing my old shoes. I‚Äôm so disappointed after spending $80 on a new work/walking shoe ‚òπÔ∏è",2,0,5
"The tongue of this shoe is pretty cheap. It's a small gripe, but it is something that you notice immediately. Also, the arch support is pretty week. I wouldn't wear these to actually run in, but they are comfortable enough and look good to just wear out and about while running errands or something.",3,0,5
"Very comfortable, good fit. However, the fabric needs to be stronger. After six months, my big toes went thru the fabric,
and now there's a hole. For the price, the shoe fabric should last longer. I wore them a few times a week, not all day, and not everyday.",3,0,5
Good fit and very light weight. Plenty of room for my orthotics once you removed the back part of the insole. I can also wear heavy socks with them.,4,1,5
"I have bought this shoe before at Academy. Was a little skeptical about ordering online, but the order is just what I needed Fits perfectly. I like the dark sole, because I wear them to work in an office and they do not look like athletic shoes at a distance.

Thank you.",5,1,5
For show only. If you want a kids shoe that lasts ...this is not it. I've spent half the money on shoes for my grandsons and they have stood up far better than these. Purchased only 2 months ago and they look a year old. Definitely will not be able to pass these down to the next one! Disappointing.,2,0,5
I wear a 9.5 and the 9.5 fit perfectly. The perfect amount of toe space for my toes to move around. I‚Äôm a vet tech and these keep my feet from hurting after a long shift.,5,1,5
"I bought two pairs for my boys , both pairs had major holes by the end of the week. The quality is terrible , Nike has lost my business",1,0,5
I bought 2 pair of these shoes different colors but same style. They are so comfortable. I had a pair on the past and wore them out. They are the most comfortable tennis shoe I have ever had. They are true to size.,5,1,5
"These are horrible. You can see glue all over the sole of the shoe, I put them on and walked around, and one shoe was tighter on my right foot and was hurting my toe. The right shoe was smaller then the left. These are fakes. I‚Äôm so disappointed.",1,0,5
"I wear these shoes every day for CrossFit workouts and long walks with my dog. They are super comfortable, stylish, and my feet don‚Äôt hurt after wearing them for extended periods of time.",5,1,5
"Good comfortable shoes, but I sent the 1st pair back to size up. Afraid they would not hold up so sized up 1/2 side. I could see my toe coming thru the thin fanric with little wear.",5,1,5
"I bought these brand new but when I received them they were used. As you can see, the bottoms are dirty. I‚Äôm very disappointed since I buy a lot from Amazon.",1,0,5
"So I‚Äôve been wearing these shoes since I got them mostly for work, they are comfortable and lightweight. No problems whatsoever besides the logo on the Tongue of the shoe peeling off within the first week on one shoe and then the same happening a few days after to the other shoe. It doesn‚Äôt look bad. You wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell unless you really were looking for it.",4,1,5
"Fantastic shoe for activity! Very light weight making it perfect for running or aerobics. I love the mesh fabric Dash it really allows my feet to breathe nicely.It has a very slim look to it and doesn‚Äôt make my feet look wide, but it still supports very well.Looking forward to buying more in different colors!",5,1,5
"I didn‚Äôt like the shoe when I received it I was disappointed ,because I was looking for the tanjun women sneakers for a while now.When I received the shoe I was so pissed ,because it was not what I had expected.I didn‚Äôt return the shoe I give it a friend.",3,0,5
"These shoes are super light and comfortable. The mesh is breathable and keeps my feet cool while the padding cushions and supports my feet. Makes them good for walking and light workouts. Don't know about running, as that's not what I got them for. Might not be enough support for high impact activities, but for me, they work great.",5,1,5
"These shoes look so great. I bought them for my twelve year old son when his feet grew a bunch suddenly along with another pair, and he loves these. They look stylish and are apparently very comfortable.",5,1,5
"Love the way these shoes look but some of the threading on the front of the shoe looked messed up after just a few days of wear, which was surprising. I love the color and my son says they‚Äôre comfortable but the durability isn‚Äôt great.",3,0,5
"I put these on the sole of my regular tanjuns of the same size but B width, and there was no difference. I bought them to wear while recovering from surgery on the big toe joint hoping they would be larger to accommodate the swelling. My old regular tanjuns are more comfortable.",4,1,5
"These shoes are amazing. I owned a different pair of Nike running shoes that always made my feet fall asleep unless I had the laces so loose they were giving me blisters. But I thought I would give Nike another shot and I absolutely love these shoes, so comfortable!!",5,1,5
The fit has been great from the start. My feet ache a bit sometimes after I've been wearing them for a while (i'm on my feet a lot at work) - and i attribute the aches to the fact that I previously wore shoes that aren't as well made as these. They are worth every penny (and nice that i got them on sale :) ) I will definitely buy Nike in the future,5,1,5
"Loves these Shoes. I own over 300 pairs of shoes and these are my go to for comfort. Already have a white pair so got a gray pair. Perfect to workout in. Light, comfortable and cute. The price is ON POINT! Will buy again. Just wish there are more colors.",5,1,5
Zero arch support really makes it difficult to look forward to walking wearing these sneakers... Tad bit snug I need to wear my thinnest peds to have them not be too tight. I‚Äôm an 8-81/2 I got the 81/2‚Äôs.,3,0,5
"I have sever feet issues. Nerve damage, broken arches to say some. I found these Nike's to be the most comfortable sneakers i ever put on my feet. I been wearing them for the pass 2 weeks now and they still look new. The are truly a dream. Btw so cute!!!",5,1,5
"I use this product for walking. I walk 10K steps or more daily. These sneakers fit very comfortably. When on, it feels like I'm walking bare foot. I wish there were more color choices in my size.",4,1,5
"This was a gift for my daughter, she wanted a Nike shoe that was All White. This product was the perfect gift and exactly what was advertised. Great fit and such a nice product that my daughter wants another pair! It was easy to order, delivery was quick and exceeded our expectations!",5,1,5
"My first pair I got from a lost and found... They were well used and who knows how long the previous owners had them. I wore those shoes everyday for 2 years. I wore these until my toes started poking through the top and had no traction left on the bottom. They were my work shoes, my running shoes and shoes for just walking the dog or going to the store. They are light weight, well ventilated and extremely comfortable, so I just had to get another pair! This time I got to pick the color though... Seeing as the ones I found were purple, haha.",5,1,5
Fast shipping. Perfect condition. Fit as expected. I loved all the color options for this shoe. I normally buy the shoe at the store but when I found all the color options on amazon I will continue to order it from here. Also about the same price as store. This shoe is great if your on your feet all day. Great for nursing.,5,1,5
These sneakers are very light weight and truly comfortable. Great to wear when walking all day in. Size is true to what I bought.,5,1,5
Pretty average shoes. Not near as comfortable as my other nikes. Very cheap padding in the arch with not much support. Seller is great.,4,1,5
These were poorly made of cheap materials and were very uncomfortable at the top of foot. Returned immediately. Big box store quality. :/,2,0,5
BEWARE!! These are fake. I have bought these shoes before from the actual Nike store and these are not as comfortable. Also I received 2 different style shoes.,1,0,5
"The fabric textures, quality and fit of these shoes are significantly different from my current tanjun (purchased directly from a Nike store)",2,0,5
"Amazon suggested I get a 7 1/2. The shoes were too small. Unable to get them in a larger size. I‚Äôm not sure if these are authentic Nikes? The bronze check looks as if someone just stamped it on the side.Otherwise, the fit and support from a narrow foot was there they were just too small.",3,0,5
I really needed new running shoes and these were the perfect match! Comfortable and stylish! I got wide due to having issues with past shoes and its been great! not much arch support so be careful there but they work for me and I do have high arches.,5,1,5
Great shoes. Very very comfortable. First time wearing them I was a part of an all day walking relay and it was like walking on a cloud six hours later still. I was surprised how much more comfortable this were than other Nike trainer shoes I‚Äôve had previously. I also received multiple compliments on the look of the shoe. The rose gold is not very pink though. More of a bronze gold but pretty still. Very happy with purchase.,5,1,5
"These are my favorite tennis shoe! When you like a pair of shoes, you keep buying the same pair! So comfortable and fit to size. Every 6 months I buy a new pair!",5,1,5

Order for my son I ordered a bit big because kids grow up so fast and leave them shoes so fast. Absolutely love it.,5,1,5
I have a super high arch so it‚Äôs comfy but I could use even more of an arch support inside. Looks very clean in design and is very light in weight. Overall quite happy!,5,1,5
I find this design perfect for me. It's classic looking and very comfortable. The plain black/white combo pairs well with everything. I wear these for international travel and they look smart and I can walk miles in them.,5,1,5
Great Shoes. I run through shoes very fast as a Amazon Delivery Driver. In a week I average 35 miles on foot. These feel good. They Do not look or feel fake at all. Great Price as well. Thanks!,5,1,5
"Shoe quality is substandard.

The material is already pulling apart on the left inside after only two weeks.

Our whole family buys Nike shoes all the time, and this is the first time I‚Äôve seen this poor of quality.

Hopefully they‚Äôll let us return it.",1,0,5
"I have been wearing Nike for years, like the fir of the shoe. The Women's Tanjun Running Shoes are super comfortable. I have a rather wide foot and feel most women's shoes are too narrow but this one was just right.",5,1,5
"Shoes works fine. I actually ordered an extra wide or maybe an extra extra wide, fits great.",5,1,5

"Like the shoes and how they keep my feet from getting too hot. They are quite comfortable and fit well.

Don‚Äôt like that the soles are so slippery I am limited in when I can walk and run. I slipped and almost fell when the roads were wet a few times.",4,1,5
LOVE these!! SOOO comfortable. Tried them on the store and considered buying. I should have gone back to the store (because I paid more on here to avoid going back). But I have barely taken them off since I purchased they are excellent sneakers and come in a ton of colors! I‚Äôd love to buy another color in the near future!,5,1,5
Kinda tight I thought I inferred size 7 but I received size 6/12 it fits but a little tight,5,1,5
Sent them back. They really really look like girls shoes. My son refused to wear them.,2,0,5
I was a bit worried about buying shoes online as my size varies and I like to see how comfortable they are before buying. These are the best shoes I‚Äôve gotten in awhile. Super happy!,5,1,5
Width is tighter than other nikes I‚Äôve bought and the toes are tight.,3,0,5
"I loved how these felt - lightweight, comfortable but supportive. I would have kept them except for the horrible seam that runs vertically from the shoelaces to the sole, just in front of the arch of my foot! It rubbed with every step. I have a wider foot and higher arches so this may be more bothersome to me than someone with a differently shaped foot. Unfortunately for me they were unwearable.",2,0,5
"Love love love them. I wear them everywhere. Comfort is unbelievable. And they look great with stretchies, shorts, jean skirts and jeans. No other sneaker has been this comfortable. I go for walks on them and wear them when I go to the City.",5,1,5
Worst quality shoes we have ever purchased. My 11 year old daughter has worn them for a couple of months and the shoe is ripping loose from the sole. CRAP! TOTAL CRAP!,1,0,5
"The arch support is excellent, I don't suffered any more of arch pain..",5,1,5

These are amazing inwearb9namd I bought 9 and they feel like I've had them forever!!!,5,1,5

"Overall I like the shoes great fit and all, and came on time... my only issue is the price say one thing and I paid a whole different amount.. is says like $50 and I paid $85 and they are not worth that not even in Nike website",4,1,5
I've gotten this shoe a year ago and it still fits perfectly! My sneakers usually break easily because I participate in alot of sports but it's still in good condition. I also have a problem with finding alot of shoes uncomfortable but these were just right.,5,1,5
These are my favorite sneakers EVER! I‚Äôve repurchased these shoes many times in different colors. Great for long days of being on your feet. I feel comfortable showing up to work in these sneakers since the design is so clean. Great for a gym and work day. I love the flexible toe fabric vs. a hard toe cover.,5,1,5
These shoes are perfect for my 5 year old. We use these for Basketball games. Our childs feet are thin and small so these lace up very light nikes are PERFECT!!! Just what I needed for my child!,5,1,5
"though I love the original Tanjuns better, the Tanjun racer is quite ok especially since I got it at a good price. Its slightly wider than the orig Tanjuns at the toe box but other than that the fits the same.",4,1,5
Wish they were like regular sneakers. The sneaker doesn‚Äôt open and the sides of the tongue is attached to the sneaker. Wouldn‚Äôt order again. Does wash well in the washer.,3,0,5
The wide with is more like a half size larger. Takes some getting used to.,4,1,5
"I think this is a scam, you pay $80 and they don't even come in a box or with any tags and do not look like real Nikes. The size is even off I would not recommend buying these.",1,0,5
I absolutely love these shoes!!! Not only do they look good and are comfortable they are also very durable!! I walk anywhere from 15-20 miles a night at work and I‚Äôve always wore Under Armour which I have nothing against them but I would have to buy new shoes every 6 months or less these shoes lasted me over a year and they‚Äôre still in good condition the inside has worn down some and there‚Äôs a tiny hole starting on the side where my pinky toe is but that‚Äôs from normal wear and tear. I tell everyone I know about these shoes because I love them so much!!,5,1,5
"Received my shoes in a timely manner and fit true to size. However, there was a security tag on the shoe which seemed strange to me. Was it stolen? Did they grab it off a store shelf and forget to remove it? idk. Anyway I had to go to the local outlet and have them remove it. Whole point of me ordering the shoes online was to avoid going to the store. Guess that didn't work out well.",3,0,5
Super cute shoes and seem to be supportive enough! I have had an ankle fusion so I HAVE to have supportive shoes so I‚Äôve only wore them for 1 day but I will update!,4,1,5
I love how I can slip on and go about my day. They comfortable all day,5,1,5

"Really nice. I'm very happy with the shoe, except, in the picture on the Amazon website, the Nike swish sign was a metallic brown. And the shoes that came in the mail had a white, nike swish sign. I love the shoes, but 2 other people in my family have the same ones. So I was really excited to find a wide shoe that was cute and unlike everyone elses.",5,1,5
"The fabric in the shoe is not properly glued to the sole, is all wrinkle. Therefore even when the sole size is, my kid does not fit in the shoe since there is no space due to the fabric. Terrible!! money wasted",1,0,5
Great for cool fall weather. I do love Nike,5,1,5
"Nice shoe, great color. Nice for summer, as fabric isn't too hot on these summer days. I did add an arch support insole. I have a narrow, not much thickness in my foot. Like them, would buy again.",5,1,5

Good looks and comfort.,5,1,5
Great quality except for one thing. We put these in the washer like all other Nikes. And when they came out they were ruined. The back hard part was bent and crumbled and the shoes are now too small.,4,1,5

Material thin,5,1,5
Typical nike shoes fit great no problems just over priced kids shoes that he will go out of in few months lol.,5,1,5
My old nike tanjuns got wore out but I loved how comfortable they were so I ordered these. I love them! Nike does tend to run a half size smaller so I ordered a half size up from what I normally wear in other shoes.,5,1,5

"These shoes run small. I went by the overall comments of others as they said these fit correctly. My shoes I ordered a size 10 as that is what I wear and they are small. I am debating on ordering a 10.5, but if those don't fit I am out of luck on money. I had $5 taken out of my return money for sending these shoes back and also they are taking 20% for a ""restocking fee"". Overall the outside of the shoes are awesome. I love the look of them.",2,0,5

I think these were reasonably priced compared to other shoe stores in the mall where Nikes are like $100. I believe they were last years model but who cares ..I know my 10 year old doesn't. They have lasted as expected for active boys. They fit as expected. No issues with delivery or product. Very sharp on!,5,1,5

"So disappointed...
I really don't believe these are genuine Nikes. They are cheaply made! They kill my feet, too.",1,0,5
My wife had been looking for a pair of grey fashion sneakers for the last year. We had tried to find a bunch but none were really that nice. These Nikes looked great but they are also a good quality shoe as well.,5,1,5

Ok,5,1,5
Bonito,5,1,5
product was as described and fit well. However the package came soaked with some gue all over it that smelled like soap and the box looked like it had been ran over and dented. it was the worse condition of packaging ive ever seen.,4,1,5
"So this is the 2nd time i have bought these shoes... first it was too big and i had to give em away... and now this one is still a lil too big for me, i will also be giving this one away... i have given up... feels very comfy tho so if u get the sizing right I think you will happy with the product",1,0,5
Nike Tanjuns are my favorite shoe ! I work on my feet all day so comfortable shoes are important. They‚Äôre very light weight and comfortable. My first pair lasted a year before I wore holes in the soles.,5,1,5
Liked these shoes until I noticed this last night. Only 7 months old and I'm highly disappointed üò©üò©üò©,1,0,5
I‚Äôm a medical Assistant and find these to be the most comfortable and light weight sneakers that are fantastic for work and play. I keep ordering more colors! My Grandson (10) also says they are his favorite and I have already bought him 2 pair.. he wears them every day!!,5,1,5

Great for workouts and everyday walking üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,5,1,5

Was purchased for daughter for gym. She still uses them!,5,1,5
Needed a comfortable shoe for work where I am on my feet all day. These fit the bill. I have other shoes I wear for running/walking which seem more structured than these.,5,1,5
The fit as expected and they are very comfortable. I wear them everyday and they don‚Äôt make my feet hurt. I would recommend these shoes.,5,1,5
Very comfortable and nice looking,5,1,5
The seams are in strange places as well as the swoosh. There is visible glue where the soles meet the shoes. Feel very flimsy.,1,0,5
My daughter said it was the best shoes she had for running.,5,1,5
"These are my everyday work shoes, I‚Äôm in health care and on my feet 10 hrs a day and these are great!",5,1,5

My mom bought how many of his peers,5,1,5

The image on the website does not show the entire shoe. It is half blue on the inside.,1,0,5
Gift for a granddaughter. She sbdolutely loves them. The fit is perfect and nobody can believe how lightweight they are. They weigh NOTHING,5,1,5
I have these exact shoes already and bought the same pair because I like them so much. They are comfortable and match with a lot of things due to the neutral color. I am an adult woman with a small foot.,5,1,5
n/a,1,0,5
"I‚Äôm in love with my shoes, comfy, soft and beautiful",5,1,5
So comfortable and light weight!,5,1,5
No breaking in period and doesn‚Äôt rub against my bunions.. Very comfortable!,5,1,5
Attractive and good quality shoe. My daughter loves them!,5,1,5
These shoes have held up surprisingly well given the daily torture they endure! No complaints of rubbing or laced that untie 50 times a day.,5,1,5
"Bought these as work shoes, since the running shoes dont tend to feel very comfy as standing shoes. Was not impressed with these.",3,0,5
I love these shoes! I purchased a 6.5 youth (I am normally a women‚Äôs size 8) and they fit perfect! They are so comfy. Couldn‚Äôt beat the price either!,5,1,5
Wonderful fit,5,1,5
I do not recommend these shoes for any price they are available for. I‚Äôve had these shoes for a month and already need a new pair of shoes. They are not very comfortable either,1,0,5
Not eligible for return! Terrible,1,0,5
"I have purchased five pairs of these Nikes over the past couple of years. They are my absolute favorite, so very comfortable and go with everything!",5,1,5
This is an excellent shoe.,5,1,5
The NIKE Women's Tanjun Running Shoes fit perfectly . They have excellent support for moderate exercise. The fast delivery was also a plus,5,1,5
i was very iffy about buying shoes online because i wouldn‚Äôt get to try them on and see how they fit but these shoes fit great and the quality was good as well!! if your looking for some nike shoes these ones are the way to go,5,1,5
Ordered a size 6 in women and got a pair of shoe smaller than a regular 6 in women‚Äôs size . Looks like a youth in size 6. Can I exchange with right size even though it is 2 weeks past the return window ?,1,0,5
"I really like these sneakers. I have trouble finding sneakers that fit, but these are probably the closest to being the most comfortable. Would definitely recommend.",4,1,5
Everything in more. very agile shoes for the 2-year old boy.,5,1,5

My daughter was very pleased with her shoes. They fit great. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly they arrived.,5,1,5
These are so cute!,5,1,5
"Love these sneakers, but a week later I found the exact same sneakers at Macy's for half the price.",4,1,5
"Very durable and well made perfect for a rambunctious toddler. Unfortunately though, they definitely run one size too small maybe even two sizes. My sons wears size 9 or 10 depending on the brand so I bought him the size 10 and they were still too small.",4,1,5
"I love these shoes! They are comfortable, durable, fit on my feet very well. The mesh upper part of the shoe has give to conform to your foot",5,1,5
"I love these shoes, comfy fit and look super cute on!!! Definitely recommending them to others",5,1,5
"These are my go-to everyday shoes. I can place an order, throw them on when I get them and go about my day and they fit perfect. Everyone asks where I get all black Nikes because they‚Äôre hard to find at times. Love these!",5,1,5
Perfect fit! I've looked around for new running shoes for a couple months now and I'm so excited to have found light and comfortable sneakers. Very happy with my purchase!,5,1,5
Very cute but does not give much support making it uncomfortable to wear all day or even a few hours. More for the style,3,0,5
"Fake, don‚Äôt waste your money on such obvious fakes",1,0,5
The shoes are good but too expensive,4,1,5
I Like These Shoes But I Believe They Run A Little Small I Had To Order A Bigger Size For Them To Fit They Are Confortable Once You Get The Size Right,5,1,5
Great shoes! Fits like a glove and it‚Äôs a nice white.,5,1,5
Merchandise was delivered promptly and was as advertised. Received many compliments on the shoe. Was very pleased with my purchase.,5,1,5
Seems like they run small,4,1,5
So some reason they were not wide enough. Sucks but I guess I'm stuck with them,2,0,5
"Excellent. This is second pair requested by grand daughter.
She really prefers these shoes.",5,1,5
LOVE THEM. Super lightweight shoe and actually very airy. I hate when a shoe is super hot and your feet can‚Äôt breathe. These are very nice.,5,1,5
I like the comfort of this shoe. I use these shoes for everyday wear,5,1,5
Very comfortable and looks very good on feet. Very durable.,5,1,5
I bought them for my granddaughter. She said she really liked them and they fit good. The shoes were as described by seller and arrived in time frame promised. üòÅ,5,1,5
These sneakers are attractive and feel like walking on clouds! The material is so flexible and gives you full mobility in your foot! So so glad I purchased these.üëçüèºüëçüèº,5,1,5
Shoe looks better in person than the photo. Buying another pair. White is a tricky color to own.,5,1,5
Great shoe! Better for running/walking.,5,1,5
I wish it came in wide width. But I like it.,4,1,5
"Just like the photos!! Found these in store but had a gift card and saw they were cheaper on Amazon. I am usually a 7.5 in Women's and per the reviews instead of ordering a 6 in kids, I ordered one size up and went with the 6.5. So glad I did and they fit perfect! Super comfortable too!",5,1,5
So far these have been great. Comfortable and light weight,5,1,5
"Definitely recommend for lovers of Nike and rose gold. Super comfortable, affordable, and beautiful! Really happy with this purchase.",5,1,5
"I got these for my daughter and she loves them. I have the same pair, but in the adult size, and they are the most comfortable tennis shoes that I own.",5,1,5
"Sent the wrong color, returned",3,0,5
My son is hard on shoes and these have lasted. I would buy them again.,5,1,5
"Very cute shoes and just as described and pictured on the site. They do run slightly small. I usually wear a size 9 and that‚Äôs what I ordered, but they‚Äôre a little too snug. I‚Äôm hoping they will stretch out a little as I wear them",4,1,5
Normal wear and tear by 9 year old boy and you can see how it fell apart and is not wearable; I alerted the company and because it was beyond the 30 day return policy they refused to do anything. Save your money and buy a quality shoe,1,0,5
"Cute, comfortable, perfect.",5,1,5
I got these because my vans were hurting my feet and back at work. They are amazing I am not in half as much pain at the end of the day as I was.,5,1,5
"Great shoe, exactly what I expected.",5,1,5
"Really cute, light, and comfortable sneakers! I usually need arch supports and even though these don't seem that supportive in the arches I have no foot pain after waking for miles",5,1,5
Nice shoes. Fit tight,4,1,5
There is no way this is real Nike. I‚Äôve been wearing this style for years and I made the mistake of ordering this pair through amazon. While it‚Äôs not the worst shoe in the world it feels nothing like the real one that I wore and loved. Do yourself a favor and buy the real shoe somewhere else,1,0,5
"Sneakers fit great. I take a size 8 in a regular shoe, but I always order an 8 1/2 in a sneaker. Bought them for every day.",5,1,5
This is not the pair of sneakers you want for long standing and walking. Terrible cushioning.,2,0,5
Got these for my wife and as soon as she opened the box she fell in love with them. Definitely recommend,5,1,5
Wife loves them,5,1,5
"Amazingly lightweight, I wear a 7.5 in sneakers, and a 7.5 in this fits perfectly. I had to loosen up the laces to make it fit better. The laces are short as you can in the photo, but it‚Äôs not a big deal. A good value overall.",5,1,5
I‚Äôve only had these for 7 months and the tread it already worn and peeling off. For this money they should hold up for much longer.,2,0,5
"I love these! I have them in different colors. I wear them for work, I'm in healthcare and on my feet most of the day. I have flat and wide feet, and these are the only shoes that accommodate them. Can not be any happier!",5,1,5
My favorite go to tennis shoe. So comfortable.,5,1,5
Walking very comfortable,5,1,5

They fit perfectly and look cute for the gym or casual day. Comfortable for all day wear!,5,1,5
Bought for being on my feet at work all day super comfy and no foot pain atvthe end of the day,5,1,5
My daughter loves them! Order a size up. They run a little small.,5,1,5
Perfect! Very snug on my feet which are rather slender so it's great to finally find a sneaker that really fits.,5,1,5
I'm a nurse and on my feet all night. I got the black and white in a size 8 and wore them for the 1st time tonight. I was miserable and my feet hurt so bad! There isn't much padding and they just feel cheap. Most uncomfortable shoes ever. Returning!,1,0,5
My wife loves the fit,5,1,5
Fits perfectly,5,1,5
The most comfortable shoes I ever had. Feels like I am walking on clouds.,5,1,5
Fits great. Need these for a wedding im in. Wasn't happy about wearing tennis shoes with a dress but these came and are actually cute!,5,1,5

I put them on and wore them all day... They are wonderful. I have serious problems with my poor feet and I'm in love with my new shoes!! Gonna get another pair as soon as I can decide on the color. Very happy with this purchase.,5,1,5
"I was a little nervous to purchase these at first since they weren‚Äôt directly from Nike but I am so glad that I did! These shoes are so much comfier than I expected and they go great with any casual or workout look! Very satisfied with these shoes.

For reference I normally wear a size 6 but went up a half size to have room for socks. Ordered a 6.5 and it fits perfectly.",5,1,5
love,5,1,5
They are very comfortable. The perfect work shoe. Only problem is they are NOT water resistant! The slightest puddle will soak your feet.,4,1,5
I gave them away! It was too expensive to send them back and they were about a size smaller than they were supposed to be. There were more like an eight and a half not a 9.,1,0,5
Love these!,5,1,5
These shoes were expensive but definitely worth purchasing.,4,1,5
"The color Solar red is misleading I thought they would be red on the brighter side but they are an odd orange/red florescent color.
I like it so I'm keeping them just not what I expected.",3,0,5
The piece on the back of the ankle digs into your ankle and makes them really uncomfortable with low rise socks.,4,1,5
I walk a lot for work and needed some new sneakers and I made the right choice. These sneakers are light and made for walking.,5,1,5
"Fit great, nice looking shoes. Hopefully they will hold up as well as mike has in the past.",5,1,5
"Best ever so comfy, nice colors/",5,1,5
Ordered a 3 and fit larger than other nike shoes my daughter has,3,0,5

"I like the light feel of this shoe.I use them for walking around on my lunch break. Purchase Size 9.5, I went a half size up for comfort.",5,1,5
No arch support,1,0,5
Just was not for me. But very nice,5,1,5
"As with most Nikes, size up, but super cut and comfortable for a commuter",5,1,5
These shoes fit just right.. I bought some Orthotics just to add a little bit more support. Perfect these are now my go shoes for walking & running..,5,1,5
"Great shoe, runs small by about a 1/2 size.",5,1,5
Good fit.,5,1,5
Very comfortable but the fabric at the toes has already gotten a hole in it. And I hardly have wore them.,3,0,5
"I'm on my feet a lot at work, so I wanted a comfortable shoe. I followed the reviews that said the shoe was true to size, but I definitely should have gotten the next size. My toes feel slightly smooshed.",4,1,5
Great gift for a family member,5,1,5
These shoes are perfect. I'm going to buy more!,5,1,5
Like expected,5,1,5
I was so happy to find red tennis shoes until I opened the box.....the shoes are hot pink......my most indecisive color!! So dissapointed.,1,0,5
"They fit me like I expected, normal Nike quality and value but much more inexpensive here on Amazon.",5,1,5
Love these shoes! I bought them for my arthritic feet and they are comfy. Soft arch support and very light weight.,5,1,5
These shoes are not supportive and quickly lost any support. Not a quality product.,2,0,5
Great looking sneaker and exactly what I wanted for my son but they definitely run on the small side and I would order a size up. Totally bummed because I need to return them but they don't have the size I need....boo-hoo...,5,1,5
Very nice and comfortable shoes i love them!!!,5,1,5
Nunca recibe mis tenis y eso que ustedes cobran primero es un mal servicio no comprare jamas!!!,1,0,5

Just right - love them!,5,1,5
I have to wear these for dance and I really enjoy the comfort and stability I have when using these,5,1,5
I ordered and x-wide. It was not true to size very narrow. Also I found a receipt in box that this had been previously returned sometime right after xmas. 1.5 months before I had ordered. Very dissatisfied,1,0,5
I had my first pair for over 2 years. These fit just as good...and talk about comfortable!,5,1,5
Very soft and comfy,4,1,5

VERY TRUE TO SIZE",5,1,5
Great fit and so comfortable.,5,1,5
I love them.,5,1,5
This is my 3rd pair super comfortable and true to size,5,1,5
"The fit is true to size. They are extremely comfortable. I like that the top is soft, so there is no hard leather or stitching to press on you or rub you the wrong way. My feet are very sensitive, so this was very important to me. They are also extremely lightweight which I like. It's a good looking show, and I am very happy with my purchase.",5,1,5
"Great fit and feel, but ""solar red"" apparently means ""the brightest florescent pink"".",4,1,5
I work in a factory setting and these shoes are wonderful for walking,5,1,5
They are lightweight and seems very comfortable,5,1,5
Package says the show is wide 2E. But the shoe is an 8 no mention of a 2E and the shoe is not wide. Ordered a second pair and had the same issue.,1,0,5
Purchased these for my 14 year old daughter she loves them says they are comfortable,5,1,5
"Shoe fits perfectly, true to size. Would purchase others.",5,1,5
Fits well. Light shoe. I think it may ware out sooner than a high priced shoe but is very comfortable to wear.,4,1,5

"These are comfortable, but would not use them for running. Thin insoles, no lace locks.",3,0,5
"These are my favorite shoes. They are light, and airy so your feet don‚Äôt sweat. They are super comfortable. Not great for hiking/gripping. Would definitely recommend to everyone though! I wear mine almost every day to the gym, and for long distance walking. They don‚Äôt make my feet hurt!",5,1,5
Very comfortable for walking. Mesh keeps you cool. Back is not too high. Good padding. Wide enough to wiggle your toes.,5,1,5
Really beautiful shoes!,5,1,5
The product arrived with a cut across the Nike symbol on one shoe like someone opened the box with a knife and the product was shipped way after the promise date. Completely missed my wife‚Äôs birthday.,1,0,5
"Present for my wife, she likes them",5,1,5
"Great shoes but not made for long usage. They actually start hurting the back of your foot if you have to be walking around for, say, more than 6 hours.",4,1,5
My favorite shoes now. They are so lightweight and comfortable.,5,1,5

Perfect size and nice color good quality. Bought it for my 15 yo daughter,5,1,5
I love the style and look of these shoes! They‚Äôre very lightweight and comfortable for a wide foot. I have plantar fascitis and feel like they also offer good support for that. The one complaint I have is that the mesh material lets water in the shoe and therefore I can‚Äôt wear these when it‚Äôs damp or raining.,4,1,5
Love these shoes. I don't have to tape my arches before my fitness class. I wear these when I know I'm going to be on my feet for hours at a time. They're awesome.,5,1,5
Bought these for my 11 year old great niece for her birthday. She picked them out and loves them.,5,1,5

Very bad,1,0,5
Use them for work since I stand all day. Very comfortable!!,4,1,5

"I initially bought the white on white and they're perfect, I love them! I get compliments on them everytime I wear them. They're great for the gym or day to day wear. Super comfortable and breathable. I bought 3 more pairs in different colors.",5,1,5
"I just got them in today, took them out of the box and put them on. They fit so comfortably. For reference I have wider feet, 8 1/2. I also love how understated these are.",5,1,5
"I was really looking forward to a new pair of shoes for work and when I first tried these on they felt fine. Well, I work 12 hour shifts on my feet and these rubbed the back of my heels and tops of my feet so bad they were raw when I got home! I wont wear them again.",2,0,5
I ordered a half size larger as I always do with Nikes. They fit perfect. The heel is stiff so I have to wear higher socks to cover my ankle but over all they look great and feel great.,4,1,5
"I am a nurse and work 12 hour shifts. When I wore my shoes for the first time, it felt like I was walking on cushion. The shoes felted so good on my feet after finishing my shift. I like how the shoes look on my feet. These shoes are stylish, colorful, comfortable and lightweight. I'm glad I purchased these shoes!",5,1,5
"I couldn‚Äôt wait for them to come and after the first try to the store and back I couldn‚Äôt stand it.
They are very high in the back and it gave me very ugly blisters. I don‚Äôt know if I can send them back after I used them one time. The back does not have a lot of cushion and being very high that creates a very uncomfortable fit . I am so sorry .... I cannot even walk ; running will be impossible.",1,0,5
I love these shoes. At first it did rub blisters on my heals. But after a few days of wearing them they aren‚Äôt as tight and are broke in perfect.,5,1,5
These run SMALL.,3,0,5
I generally wear an 8 in shoes and an 8.5 in athletic sneakers/runners. I got these in an 8.5 and they fit quite well - EXCEPT - wow is there something wrong with the way the backs of these shoes curve. Right into your achilles tendon with exceptional force. I saw other people mention this in their review but I didn't think I'd have a problem with it because I always wear socks with a very cushioned heel tab. You can see the black stripe on my sock heel in my photos- it's right where this hits my achilles tendon. And it does not help. At all. These were so painful. Even just standing - not even moving - they dig in and hurt. I only lasted a minute or two wearing these around my house before I packed them up for a speedy return. I'd only recommend these if you don't have achilles tendons.,2,0,5
"I know my bad review is strange since these are my second pair. I‚Äôll explain‚Ä¶. I bought my first pair at Kohl‚Äôs and I was stuck with them because I wore them outside sooo I went through very uncomfortable long walks & workouts with horrible blisters on both heels (caused by the high heel design and rough material) until eventually they became bearable while I continued looking for a new pair. (clearly I haven‚Äôt been successful). I‚Äôve had them for 1 1/2 years and they finally fit to the point I‚Äôm not uncomfortable but the cushioned footbed is flat & worn & I have a hole in the front left shoe so I need a new pair. I would normally never walk around with a hole in my shoe but I‚Äôm having a hard time finding a new pair. I finally decided to order these, I wasn‚Äôt excited to get the same exact shoe but thought I‚Äôd go up 1/2 size , that would definitely help and deal with it. I‚Äôm not convinced I will keep them. I feel even though I went up a 1/2 size I‚Äôm still going to get blisters. At this point I need to go into a store and try them on which I‚Äôve done several times ü§´ After reading a lot of reviews (after I received) it seems it‚Äôs a design flaw for the blister issues! Also, I remember when I bought my first pair I thought they were super comfortable, that was NOT the case once I went out on a 2 hour walküò≠ I know everyone has different feet these might work for some people but not for me. I don‚Äôt want to get stuck with another pair.",3,0,5
"The other reviews regarding the narrow/uncomfortable heel are somewhat accurate, but consideration needs to be given to the breaking-in period. Yes, the heels will pinch you during the first few wears, but you can break in the shoes by wearing them around the house with thick socks. Once these sneakers are molded to your feet, they are extremely comfortable with superior cushioning. If you're looking to wear a pair of sneakers out of the box, I would pass on these. If you're willing to be just a little more patient, you'll be rewarded in spaces. I would absolutely buy these again.",4,1,5
"These are going to fit my two left feet so well. NOT. Received two shoes, one is a size 8, the other is a size 9. Both are for the two left feet that I didn‚Äôt know I had which are apparently two different sizes. Cute shoe but can‚Äôt comment on anything else but looks. Also, my right foot feels slighted. Return.",1,0,5
"They are super cute. I went for a power walk, right away I felt my Achilles being dug into. I figured it may loosen up. I ordered 8.5, sizing is accurate. I tried different socks to avoid the friction and my Achilles being dug into. The part that touches Achilles is hard and sharp. If I can‚Äôt walk in them I sure can NOT run in them. Maybe it‚Äôs just the white pair and how they are designed. Sadly, I will have to return them.",2,0,5
"These shoes were uncomfortable the minute I put them on. Hard soles, not bouncy. Usually, with a new pair of shoes, as soon as you put them on they feel great. The part that sticks up above the heel is stiff and cuts in to my lower back leg. The top of the tongue material felt uncomfortable as well, as though there is a seam there. I have nothing good to say about these sneakers.",1,0,5
"Super cute shoes, but I had to return because they were too small. I wear a 7.5 and bought an 8. Size up",4,1,5
"This is the first time I have ever considered that I may have gotten a fake item on Amazon. I own these exact shoes in a size 8 that i purchased from Finish Line, i only had them a few months and they got quite dirty so i ordered the same pair from Amazon and i cant even get my foot into the size 8. The shoe is also very hard and stiff, Ive never experienced something like this before.",1,0,5
"Runs small. Nikes are the only running shoes I wear because of their arch support. Unlike their other shoes, however, these have no arch support. They are very padded, but still require an arch insole. Also, most of their shoes have a notch out of the heel to make a crescent shape and allow room to move. These have a heel that makes an arch high up on the heel and makes blisters in less than 20 minutes of wearing. Poor design and will make me think carefully before purchasing this brand in the future.",2,0,5
"Light weight and they look great. Not as narrow as Nike shoes that I had before which was a concern. They're actually a little roomy.

I was able to wear them for hours right away. Will definitely consider others in this line.",5,1,5
"I walk a lot and buy quite a few walking/running shoes. I recently purchased a couple of Nikes and found them to be the perfect design for my feet. Unfortunately, this design in the same size as the others were to short. I had to return them.",3,0,5
"Love the style and colors; fresh for summer but after just one wear within the first hour, felt pressure on the back of my ankle. When I got home, had a blister on the back of my ankle. Not worth the pain. Needs heel cushion.",3,0,5
"These shoes run very small. I ordered a half size larger than I usually wear due to other people saying they run small, and they still did not fit well, still very tight.
The shoe is really a nice looking shoe, but I just couldn't deal with how tight they fit and had to return them.",3,0,5
"I loved these shoes when I first got them, but now they started making a clicking noise when I walk and it‚Äôs very disappointing!! I purchased these because I had another pair just different color that just wore out. Other than the noises when I walk they are just like my others.",2,0,5
"I liked the style, the cushion, and the comfort of the shoe. However, after walking on them for a few minutes, my feet began to feel like they were being pushed/slid forward, hitting against the front, which made my toes sore. I am returning these shoes.",2,0,5
"I rarely write reviews but I had to for these. These shoes look great and at first feel great. However, after two weeks of running in them, I started developing shin splints. I've had them and have ran in them for two months now and have to consistently deal with shin splints. The one year old shoes I had before these never gave me any shin splints.

For context, I run around 11 miles per week.",1,0,5
"The shoe is beautiful, but it is just too small. I wear a size 9 but this is extremely tight and I cannot wear socks with the shoes. Will probably need to order at least a half size up for these to be comfortable.",4,1,5
Really cute and came fast. Great support and comfortable but I had to return them because they were too tight. They didn‚Äôt really match with my uniform either so I never got around to ordering another pair,5,1,5
Horrible experience buying running shoes online. I wore them once for a 3 mile walk/run and they tore my feet apart. So disappointed with the brand because I expected better than that for the price I paid. Will never buy walking/running shoes online again. My feet hurt as if they've been put through a grinder.,1,0,5
Oh my goodness is all I have to say amazing perfect!,5,1,5
"Even though I bought a half size larger, the shoe keeps hurting my ankle due to the design or a flaw.",1,0,5
They fit as expected. Nike products are wonderful. No surprises. This is the only brand I‚Äôm able to order online without worry about it not fitting properly.,5,1,5
"True to size. Very comfortable. Great for running! Love the color and cushiony heel. I did notice some slight rubbing on my heels the first few times of wearing them, but that goes away after they get a little broken in.",5,1,5
I will be returning. Sadly!! I got the normal size I buy with Nike and they were a size to small. So bummed cuz I‚Äôm nit buying again. I feel that something isn‚Äôt right!! I have a lot a of Nike sneakers never have I had to go a full size larger. 8 1/2 normal size but def need a 9 1/2 if I were to buy again.,3,0,5
"Check the attached images that the shoes has different size, in the first image has 7 US size and the second image has 6 US size, In the image with both shoes you can see that they have different sizes, I'm very disappointed",1,0,5
"Love these shoes. Took about 1 week longer than expected to arrive due to weather conditions, but they are the best shoes I've worn so far. I bought some for myself a while back. These are the only shoes that don't require extra insoles. I'm a coach and I'm on my feet all day walking around. My feet feel great and do not ache with these shoes. I just bought a pair for my daughter for the track season.",4,1,5
"I can seriously say, I finally found the perfect tennis shoes! I struggle with aching feet plus plantars ... I am looking to buying a next pair!",5,1,5
"the sneaker rubs on my heal, within minutes I developed blisters. I put band aids on and bought athletic sneakers but it's not helping. I can't use them. I like the look of the sneaker and the fit feels great until i start walking./",2,0,5
"Everything seems nice and pretty, but ordered 8.5 and received 9.5 it was a gift for someone living in another country, so TOTAL FAIL for me.",3,0,5
The best tennis shoes I ever had,5,1,5
Reviews warned to order ONE FULL SIZE BIGGER. You need to do this. Also expected more comfort for the high cost. Very sub par shoe.,3,0,5
"Wow. I‚Äôve never had this problem with Nike‚Äôs before. Put them on for the first time to walk my dogs. Super comfortable until I actually started walking. They rubbed horrible blisters into the back of my heels in 20 mins. I usually don‚Äôt get blisters and I understand that shoes should be worn in before taking them on significant treks, but this is crazy. How is one supposed to break them in when you can‚Äôt walk in them for more than 10 mins? Pick another pair.",2,0,5
These look a lot better in person. They rubbed back of my ankle but I think it‚Äôs just going to take time to break them in. Love them,4,1,5
Nike is a go to when you want to buy awesome running sneakers. Love them and recommend them.,5,1,5
I love everything about this shoe if you need to stand long periods of time this is the shoe for you .,5,1,5
Great looking shoes just small fit,2,0,5
"I originally purchased a size 6 because in a regular shoe I wear a 5. But because of running, the feet swell so that was the reason for the size 6.
The shoe was extremely comfortable, cushioned arch, wider back end for stability, etc., but the 6 was TOO small. I returned it and purchased a 6.5 and it‚Äôs perfect and comfy !",5,1,5
"the purchase was successful, meets all expectations. What i recommend. a little small",5,1,5

"El tenis es muy confortable con respecto a la absorci√≥n del impacto al caminar, pero me molesta y me ha pelado en la parte de atr√°s del pie (tal√≥n), pues la parte del tenis que cubre esa √°rea, est√° muy inclinada hacia adentro y eso le limita el uso del calzado, pues a los pocos pasos, siento que el roze del calzado en la parte del tal√≥n, me provoca dolor e incomodidad.",3,0,5

Lastima que me queda tallado. Y ped√≠ mi talla 7.",5,1,5
Great shoe with plenty of support. Versatile and stylish,5,1,5

"They run Very small. I normally wear a 9.5 or even a 9 and my other Nikes are 9.5, but this time I bought a 10 and my toes touch the end of the toe box! I keep wearing them but it‚Äôs very disappointing",3,0,5
"Not true to size. Too harsh on the back of the heal. Shoe is very stiff, close to no flexibility for the balls of your feet. Overall a painful experience.",1,0,5
I always order Nike in the same size & never have a problem. With this style I should have ordered atleast a half a size up. These are very tight across the top of my foot. The most uncomfortable pair of Nikes I own. That being said the bottom are very cushiony so I like them in that respect.,3,0,5

"I purchased identical shoe directly from nike store last year, I figured buying from Amazon I would get same product but it's at least a size and a half smaller than my authentic nike from the store. I checked size on label in both sets of shoes and both are 9.5 so I have to assume the pair from Amazon are not real Nikes.
Trying to return them is not easy because I have no way to make labels for returningüò£",1,0,5
"I just purchased my second pair. The comfort in the heel support is amazing and why I love these so much. The do run extremely small. I‚Äôm always a size 8 and I wear an 8 1/2 in these and they fit just perfect, so if you need a little more room I would suggest going up to a 9. They‚Äôre not overly bulky looking or feeling, and fit great and look great with leggings and skinny jeans. Nike shoes tend to run narrow. Glad I found these.",5,1,5
"They are comfortable other than they are very high and very stiff at the Achilles tendon area at the back of the shoe. The arch support is good but the shoes are painful after a while. I'm working 12-hour shifts and needed moleskin to cover open blisters after 4 hours and I bled into the shoes, even with higher socks. Perhaps these are designed as more of a fashion shoe, probably comfortable to run errands but not good for working on your feet.",3,0,5
"This beautiful sneaker was a gift, so I was REALLY upset that they were too small. I've worn Nikes size 9 for years, so why do these fit so poorly? Even worse, I wore them outside, so no exchange...",1,0,5
"I love Nike shoes, but these ones missed the mark. The back (as stated in many reviews) of the shoes are very stiff. I got blisters the first several times I wore them, hoping to break them in. It only semi worked, but are still so uncomfortable on my heels, that I don‚Äôt even try to wear them anymore. I regret buying them, which is sad to say. Also: if you are still going to gamble this purchase, size up...they run about a half a size small.",2,0,5
The sneakers fit just right. Nice and comfortable!,5,1,5
"This product is definately not original , so uncomfortable and the fit is pathetic . It hurts my ankle . Nike is my fav brand and by seeing and wearing it can say this is not original .",1,0,5

" These sneakers are so comfortable & cushioned from the heal to the ball of the feet. I'm ecstatic. They run a whole size small. I wear a 6.5 & ordered a 7 and my toes are right at the tip of the shoe, put on socks and it's a tight fit. I'm returning for a 7.5",5,1,5
Okay so these shoes are comfortable but I would suggest upping one size for comfort. I have wore this for 3 days now and I got blisters kn the second day. It does not seem to get any more comfortable than what it was the first day. I will probably be exchanging it for a bigger size.,3,0,5
"Very Comfortable, Fits true to size, I work in the Medical Field and I am on my feet 12 hours a day. Perfect Stretch, no stiffness. Love them 5 Stars",5,1,5

"Very comfortable, easy on foot",5,1,5
It's a comfortable shoes.,4,1,5
"Muy C√≥modos, como lo esperaba.",5,1,5
These are literally the most comfortable sneakers I‚Äôve bought in a very long time. I‚Äôm on my feet 12-13 hours a a day Nursing. They never had the weird break in period that make your feet uncomfortable. I‚Äôm beyond happy with these and will buy them again regularly. I read reviews and bought 1/2 size bigger than usual and they fit perfect.,5,1,5
I love this shoe. It fits snug to my narrow foot so I can feel save that I will not brake an ankle running. If you have wide foot then these are not the shoes for you. Normal foot wearers may need a size up. I love them!!!,5,1,5
Very comfortable. Really happy with it.,4,1,5
"Really excellent running shoes, good support and shock absorption in the heels in particular. They fit maybe just a tiny bit snug so consider going up a half size if you've got wide feet.",1,0,5
"Very comfortable. Provides lots of support and cushioning for long walks. The colors are amazing. Would recommend 100%,",1,0,5
I love them !!! The color are amazing,5,1,5
The runners do not fit I‚Äôve worn Nike 8.5 women‚Äôs for the last 15 years these shoes are stiff too tight and have no breathability.,5,1,5
Super achat ! Shipping un peu long...,5,1,5
Comfortable,4,1,5
"Very comfortable but little arch support. Unfortunately I need arch support and these are a very flat sole with light cushion to absorb some impact. I honestly cannot imagine using these for high impact or for an extended period. I think they would be fine for lifting or low-impact workouts but I would not use them for running.

The upper is very comfortable and I like a roomy toebox and don‚Äôt want things touching my toes.

Overall, fit as expected.",3,0,5
"I love Nike products, and this shoe is no exception. The fit is great, they are very comfortable to walk in (I walk an average of 3 miles a day) and I have no problems with wearing them all day long.",5,1,5
"I always buy new Nike Trainers when my old ones get worn.

I hate these compared to the last 2 pairs I bought...

I agree with what everyone is saying about the tongue pressing into the top of your foot. Also, the heel sits a little low in the back, doesn't feel like the shoe is securely on. In general, there's no structure or support to these shoes.

I'm still going to keep these... I live in a pretty remote area in Asia. The sneaker selection here has small sizing. And it would take me 1 month to get something different from Amazon shipped here, so I'm settling bigtime.

I clearly wouldn't recommend these to anyone. If you have other options, take them! Spend your money elsewhere.

Honestly, I'm not even sure if I'll buy Nike Trainer's ever again if this is the direction their design is going. I thought it was a brand I could trust and I was wrong.",1,0,5
I loved the Nike Flex Trainer 8. I own 3 pairs of them and really like the fit. However this iteration of the Nike Flex Trainer #9 is AWFUL. They changed the way your arches are supported and the tongue rubs painfully against the top of your foot. It even feels cheap. DO NOT BUY this Nike style. You will have to end up returning it like I am.,1,0,5
Adorable style but awful fit. I wear an 11 but have to size up to 12 in Nike because they run small. Tried these on and they were baggy in the heel which is so weird..but tight across the top. And poor support doesnt feel like much padding in the sole.,2,0,5
"These are really cute, very light, but the area where the shoes tie is very uncomfortable, it rubs even with socks on. The fabric is so thin you are rubbing right against all the ""hardware"" there. Kind of a dumb design, the ""tongue"" doesn't protect like it should. I really don't recommend these.",3,0,5
"I wear these shoes for HIIT workouts, weight lifting and workout classes. They are so light and comfortable! I was pleasantly surprised for the cost! I usually wear heavier, running shoes and I'm so happy I tried something new. I ordered 8 Wide, based off others reviews and I'm glad I did. I normally wear size 8 or 8.5 and the 8 fit perfect. I would suggest playing with the shoe laces and shoe tongue to get your perfect fit. I initialy thought the fit hurt the top of my foot, but after multiple adjustments, it fits like a glove, so don't get mad like I did when I first put them on.",5,1,5
"I love, love, loved the way these look on my feet. I tried so hard to make them work by wearing thin socks and wearing them even though they were literally pinching my feet, hoping they‚Äôd stretch. At the end of the day, the reviews are correct. The bottom of the tongue area is simply too tight. No amount of adjusting can fix that. Had to return. So sad!",3,0,5
"i have had 3 pairs before these, love them. i wear 3 hrs a day at work, even gardening at work. hold up super well, under harsh cond. water, mud, dirt. this flex is nice, like a flexible back heel part, easy to slip in out of. i like them unlike other posts say. colors brite so nice. great shoe. i will cont. to buy yr after yr .",5,1,5
"These are very good looking shoes. However, the fit is tight and there is absolutely no give or ability to stretch out. The material appears to be stretchy, but in actuality it feels more like canvas and doesn't stretch.
I ordered a 6 1/2. My normal size is a 6 and these were still too tight. I'm disappointed because I wore them outside (and they hurt my feet within the first hour )and so I can't return them.
Big bummer.",3,0,5
"I wear a women's shoe size 12 so finding shoes that are comfortable and don't make my feet ""look"" larger than they are is very (very) challenging. These look great. They are very lightweight. I wear them to the gym for weight training but do not think they are appropriate for running. The bottom rubber sole seems a bit too soft and small rocks like to jam and get stuck. Other than that, I really like this sneaker. The color of the material is unique, sort of a blend between gray and silver with black trim. I think they look great and they also look very nice to wear with jeans. I've only been wearing them for a week so I cannot rate longevity yet. I'll update the review if I experience any problems.",5,1,5
"The area under the tongue of the shoe rubbed against the top of my foot and was quite uncomfortable. Otherwise, I liked the larger toe box and it fit like a size 7. Unfortunately, I had to return the shoes due to the rubbing and pressure from part of the shoe.",2,0,5
"I‚Äôm going to keep the tennis shoes, though they still need a lot of work. They are extremely, extremely tight across the bridge underneath your toes. I even had three other people try them on and they both experienced the same thing. That said, they are very light, and the price point is good, so I‚Äôm going to just see if I can stretch them out.",3,0,5
"These arrived a day late. You can definitely tell one of my shoes was worn and ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù from this seller. The discoloration is faint but it‚Äôs there.
I do not recommend purchasing from this seller as the shoes were advertised as new.",2,0,5
"I ONLY buy Nike. My last two pairs of Nike sneakers lasted me almost seven years! I have to say these ones are the most comfortable ones I have EVER bought. I'm not a runner, but I use these for long walks, lots of hills and some grassy areas (almost like hiking) and for the gym. I have plantar fasciitis, and one ankle that is weak due to a nasty sprain a few months ago. These sneakers have EXCELLENT support! I usually have to buy custom inserts for my shoes because I have really deep arches (when they aren't supported the plantar fasciitis is unbearably painful) but I did not need to. My feet don't cramp up and they don't rub and give me blisters. Breathable fabric too!",5,1,5
"Great for casual wear but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them for running or hard core exercise as they fit very snug if you have a wider foot. I am a size 9 1/2 in a running shoe so I ordered a 10 and they were still too small, and that‚Äôs without socks! Love the style and color, and I wear them for the purpose of running errands and yard work, but again, definitely not great for workouts.",3,0,5
"I‚Äôm just two months in to these shoes and wear them mostly for just running around and an occasional walk. The insole has slipped where now my toes are hanging over and rubbing, the tops are beat down and shoes strings frayed. I‚Äôve never had a pair of Nike shoes just fall apart like this and I‚Äôve worn other pairs for years before I had to thrown them out. These need to go in the trash. I took a walk the other day and after only a mile I had to change shoes to finish they were killing my feet. Is there anyway to refund these terrible broke down excuse for just do it shoes‚Ä¶",1,0,5
"Nike has never disappointed me . . . I bought these specifically because my last pair had a tab at the tongue and heel that made them easy to put on. These don't have as much stretch or give, not quite the same, but not a deal breaker. They do seem room around the front part of my foot, and I'm not sure that will get better in time, because it is beyond the lacing (so even if I pull them tight, still roomy in the toe area. But I wear them for work out classes and so far so good.",4,1,5
"I had the 8 to this previously and I am walk up to 4 miles in it. This is no different. I wore them for the first time today on a 4 mile walk and they were light and flexible just like the 8. They fit as expected im a 9.5 and bought 9.5. However I do tend to wear thicker socks and the 8 was definitely a more of a snug fit than these. I don't like that the tongue is on the thicker end and is sewed to the base and not the sides, to get it flat after putting on takes a little finesse. However I do like that I can tighten around my ankles by tightening the lace due to the top lace looks are linked to the piece round the back of the shoe.",4,1,5
"The packaging these were shipped in was more substantial than the shoes. No arch support. No cushioning in the sole. Inferior materials used for the upper. Strap the box on your foot you'll get the same experience as wearing this shoe for your workout. I returned them. Nike used to stand for superior quality, Now you pay for a swoosh. Ended up going, of all things, Sketchers. I work out daily and wanted support for my feet. Their arch-support line nailed it, support I was looking for and sole cushion for miles!",1,0,5
"Running shoes can be very uncomfortable for people with tall arches or just tall feet in general. In my case, these shoes hurt the top of my right foot which has a taller arch than my left. I ended up lacing the shoes differently to accommodate for the extra space that I needed on top and then there was none of that uncomfortable pressure on the top of my foot. My only other problem was that the shoes are more narrow than I expected. Not uncomfortably narrow, just narrow enough that makes me think that the sides will wear quicker.",4,1,5
"I love these shoes. I got them to replace my current Nikes - which have endured years at the gym - and I couldn't be happier. They fit comfortably with the toe slightly wider than the heel.

My only dislike about the shoe is that the heel is higher than my last pair and rubs annoyingly against the back of my ankle. Hopefully this will go away after I've broken them in more (It's been 1 week).",5,1,5
Toe bos is a little wide but other than that the fit was true to size for me. These are casual shoes for a sporty outfit or low impact days at the gym. Might be ok for light walking on even terrain but nothing more. Quality is what I expected and they work great for my casual dress days or kids sporting events.,4,1,5
"When I pulled the shoes out of the box I thought: these are fake. Quality is not what I expect from Nike. Cheap, no support, runs small, low in heal and narrow at the toe. The black Nike insignia across the top (bought light gray w/ aqua) is bad design. Did not notice this in pics. Will wear to walk dog around the block.",3,0,5
"The eyelet that braces the shoelace from rubbing against the fabric of the shoe broke apart within at right about 2 months of wear, only indoors, never wet or damaged. If I continue wearing the shoe, the shoelace pulls on the fabric and will eventually tear the shoe itself. The one star rating isn't necessarily for the shoe, because this seems to be a defect & since I'm otherwise satisfied with them, but for Nike customer service and my lack of options on returning/exchanging the shoe. Would give zero stars if I could.",1,0,5
Needed a new shoe for training it‚Äôs light flexible with enough support to manage jump squats.,5,1,5
"I wear a size 10 with my other Nike running shoes, but these in the same size and they were like boats! looked terrible and had zero support. I assumed that it was the size, so I bought a size down. Just received it and they are so tight at the bottom of the tongue, my feet hurt simply by standing. I am returning both and am really disappointed....",1,0,5
I got stardust- phantom white -coral color. The shoes look cute but it is definitely not an original. The insides of the shoe feel like cheap foam material and the sole has no support at all. This can hurt the feet at the time of training. This is not an original because I have always worn nike and I have never seen a shoe with this kind of sole and material from this brand. Returning it immediately.,1,0,5
"The tongue on this shoe rolls and has to be readjusted through the day. I love the whole feel of the shoe minus the tongue. I bought these to dance in, the flex makes it easier, the flex shoe design makes it really easy for the shoe to capture small rocks.",4,1,5
"I bought it to workout at the gym. Was very disappointed on how the tongue fit. It appears that they forgot to include the tongue during the manufacture process and added it later.
I would have return it but I wore it to the gym.",3,0,5
"1 week after getting my shoes the stitching on the shoe started coming undone. The tongue of the shoe is way too big and bunches up inside the shoe when you tie it, which causes it to irritate the top of your foot. I only wear them more as a casual walking around shoe. They clearly are not a running or extended walking shoe, they would never hold up. Disappointed in This Nike product!!!!",1,0,5
"I have my doubts whether these are actually authentic Nike. A lot of glue around the soles, poor stitching, and the sizing is off. I own a good amount of nike running shoes and trainers and I wear a size 6.5 in all of them. These 6.5s are way too big. The arch support in these shoes is horrible. Almost like the arch support is flipped. No support on the inside and huge arch support on the outer part of the shoe. They are unwearable. Im going to go to an actual store and try them on from somewhere I know they are legit, but these seem like extremely low quality shoes.",1,0,5
Only used for 30 min a day 30 days and ripped! The return window closed not worth the purchase,1,0,5
"I feel like I'm one of the few who likes these and I don't normally like Nike sneakers...they were light, cute and rather comfy for the roughly 100k steps I took over a long weekend vacation and a couple of bootcamp classes. They served their purpose. I wouldn't wear these for long runs or anything overly intense impact - but jacks, jumps, lunges, skaters, etc. - felt study and comfy for me.",4,1,5
Comfortable and right size but how do I keep this tongue from popping up/forward. Not enough holes for proper lacing.,3,0,5
"I have never bought shoes on line before, let alone for my wife. She wanted these so I bought them. She loves them and now I am a hero. She had a knee replacement and needed the new shoes. She loves them and wears them everywhere.",5,1,5
"I‚Äôve been wearing Nikes since high school, at work and for workouts. These are pretty good, comfortable, but the tongue on this shoe is big and doesn‚Äôt lay flat. The soles were also a little slick on the weight bench during my workout (hopefully will roughen up in time).",4,1,5
"Like style idea/look, but not so much on my feet. Might have given it a shot, but they were too small. Didn't seem to have much support. I usually like Nike, but had to return this pair.",3,0,5
"There is a bright blue strap along the heel that is solid and will not stretch so that I cannot put the shoe on. This strap is not mentioned in the description, it took me 3-4 minutes to get one shoe on, using a shoe horn. I returned them.",3,0,5
Yes! These are expensive! I was hesitant but I‚Äôm satisfied they fit as expected! I am 125 pounds I wear a 7 1/2 and it fits perfectly and they are very comfortable,5,1,5
"Great shoe great quality just not for wide chunky feet especially if your feet get puffy during workouts. The ties stopped at an awkward place on my feet so it always felt like my feet would slip out and if i tied it enough so it doesnt feel like that it was too uncomfortable to work out in. This is more of a run errands than a work out shoe, unless you have very slim narrow feet.",4,1,5
"Nike appears to have some Quality Control issues. My daughter was very dissatisfied with her gift from me. She is a college athlete, and knows quality. This Nike gift did not measure up, unfortunately.",2,0,5
"I love the color and the it is very comfortable. My foot tends to be a little wide and I found it difficult to put on at first, but have figured it out. Best of all no blisters.",5,1,5
"I love the look of this shoe. I've been wearing Nike for my past few pairs of athletic shoes and I am disappointed with the comfort of this pair. I have a high arch, which might be part of problem.",3,0,5
"Most certainly not ""new"" as the seller stated! There's mud in the treads on the bottom in a few places, scuffs along the sides, and hair and twigs inside the shoes. The shoes themselves are quite nice outside of being lied to about them being new.",2,0,5
Overpriced and non supportive. Every time I do my outdoor camp gladiator workouts in these I end up with strained calves or shin splints.,1,0,5
"Hate these! Took them back! If you like feeling like your shoes are on the wrong foot, these babies are for you! I couldn‚Äôt even take two steps in them before ripping them off!",1,0,5
"I love these!!! They fit perfect size wise, when you first get them you may have to mess with strings. Super tight first out of the box!",5,1,5
"They‚Äôre cute, but super uncomfortable. I can‚Äôt imagine working out in them. They run a little small and have no support. Good for hanging around the house, I guess.",3,0,5
I normally wear a size 10 but these needed to be a 9.5 to fit right. They even look too big and make me feel like I have clown feet. If ur between sizes I'd size down. Also they are very light weight which is great but you can see the outline of toes. Not sure if thats just because the size wasnt right. Other than that they are a good light weight everyday shoe,4,1,5
I got these shoes to replace my old sneakers. They are lightweight and have good cushion. They are a bit tight across the top of my feet. . . maybe they will stretch.,4,1,5
"Sizing was right and style was great, but there was something very off about the sole and insole. Bought these to replace trainers I had owned for a year, but even my old busted up Nikes had more foot support than these. Ended up returning them.",1,0,5
"I love this show but the first one came in the wrong color and the second one came with the ink filled locked security tag on !! Come On !
I hope the third time is the charm !",3,0,5
So these shoes are really cute but that‚Äôs about it. A lot of reviews said the shoe being uncomfortable well they were right. These are the most uncomfortable shoe ever. I also bought inserts and somehow made the shoe more comfortable. I‚Äôm returning these shoes because they are terrible.,2,0,5
"Horrible shoes. I usually live the Tex shoes b cause of their comfort, but these shoes are horrible. Flat insoles, tongue hurts the top of my foot because the way it is sewn in.
They are terrible!!!",1,0,5
"Nike has never disappointed me like these shoes have, fits smaller than usual and the sole is very firm and I work in a clinic all day and these are probably the first shoes I‚Äôve worn that make my feet feel worse at the end of the day.",3,0,5
"Not a great shoe , kind of flimsy with poor support , not comfortable , runs about half a size small .",2,0,5
Yep- these are great! True to fit and comfy for daily activities as well as jogging! Plus what a great color selection!,5,1,5
"Fit as expected, but needed a little ‚Äútraining‚Äù for the material on the instep to lay flat and not bunch up when inserting foot. Fit well once laced up.",4,1,5
They look better in person than the picture so pretty !,5,1,5
The tongue is weird on these shoes. It makes them a bit uncomfortable you have to adjust the heck out it . After long day of work I take off for drive home.,3,0,5
I love the color of these shoes. The support is bad. My feet hurt after wearing them for longer than one hour. Great for around the house.,2,0,5
"These go with so many outfits but I don't wear daily to keep them clean love them , not as comfy as air max but great for half the price of other cute kicks",5,1,5
"These are awful! Fit is very poor. The heel feels like it is slipping off to the side. Wore these to walk on the treadmill and to a Zumba class and the bottom of my feet are in incredible pain the next morning.
Do not recommend.",1,0,5
"I always buy Nike and am usually happy, but this one came and when you put it on the laces don't go high enough on the top of your foot and makes you feel like you are going to walk out of the shoe. The pro is they are very light weight, but so much so that I don't feel support in my ankles at all when even walking. Not the best pair.",2,0,5
"Wide fit, unusual for Nike. Didn‚Äôt come in a Nike box, odd.",3,0,5
"I bought this as an everyday walking shoe. I work a job where I'm constantly up and about, and these shoes have been very comfortable throughout the day. They also look great and are easy to match with any outfit. Nike shoes tend to run half a size smaller than my normal size. I'm usually a size 7. I got a size 7.5, which fits perfectly for me.",5,1,5
"This is my third pair of Flex shoes! I LOVE these shoes. No longer for purchase, so when I found them on Amazon I was so excited.",5,1,5
They are okay and they are cute but not comfortable at all. I had to purchase new insoles to get through the day.,3,0,5
Took them right out of the package and worked out in the; lifting and cardio for an hour. My feet were comfortable and supported the entire time.,5,1,5
Very good sneakers. I think they are a bit tight in the upper part where you tie the the laces,5,1,5
Not a lot of support around the ankle... fits loose around the ankle.,3,0,5
"The real deal, not much to say other than the sole's design does not look expensive, but the color and fabric is authentic nike material. Good purchase.",4,1,5
"nice for a gym workout, not for running. light-weight. fits snug in lace area.",4,1,5
These shoes suck. Don‚Äôt waste your money they have no support are all baggy don‚Äôt work at all for running.,1,0,5
I am using this shoe with my old Nordic Track skier. The Shoe is lightweight and flexible and fits in the skis perfectly. Shoe fit was as expected and I am delighted with them.,5,1,5
"Listed as new, but arrived clearly used and stained in many places.",1,0,5
"I wear these to work and I get many compliments on how cute these are!! I love the way they look. I will admit the first time I wore them the tongue part was super uncomfortable but they just needed to be broke in, but now they are great. No sore feet at the end of my work day and they look great. Win win!",5,1,5
My daughter usually has a hard time finding shoes. These are win. She loves how these fit and wears them every day!,5,1,5
"I purchased my regular size. The shoes fit perfectly and are so comfortable! Great price, too!",5,1,5
"This are not the most comfortable Nikes that I‚Äôve had. The tongue is thick and bunches up, hurting the top of my foot. They also look bulky.",3,0,5
Really comfortable!!,5,1,5
Cheap for mike. I don't recommend. Bad fit.,1,0,5
"These are the most lightweight and comfortable sneakers I have ever owned! Very happy , I am now a sneaker girl!",5,1,5
Usa diariamente mi hija,5,1,5
"Love them! Fit great, comfortable and super cute!",5,1,5
I love the colors. Fits true to size. I just don‚Äôt like the mesh at the front on top of the shoe.. the material of the mesh makes the shoe very loose there,5,1,5
The fit is too small. I wear a 9.5 and ordered that size but I had to force my foot in. I thought I needed to just break them in so I wore them for only a couple of hours. I couldn‚Äôt keep them on my feet hurt so bad! Do not recommend.,1,0,5
Very uncomfortable. Shoes for you gave me 1/2 of my refund back. Never will i buy from them again.,2,0,5
Fits like a glove. I love these shoes. There so cute. At first they were uncomfortable because i hadnt broke them in yet. But now that i wore them for a little bit i love them,5,1,5
Fitted as I expected and I like the Color.,5,1,5
Love the sneakers but I have a wide foot,5,1,5
Nice looking light weight shoe for walks,5,1,5
"Perfect for everyday, exercising!!!!",5,1,5
Sad day. Only Nike shoe that has been uncomfortable. The sole is thin and no support.,1,0,5
"Amazing fit - I‚Äôve had this shoe before so I was intend to look for it again. The part we‚Äôre you toes is a flexible so if you have bunions or other foot problem - no problem! The back where your heel is not terribly padded so the heel fits comfortably, and the heel lift is easily accessible.",5,1,5
Comfy,5,1,5
I don‚Äôt even believe these are real Nikes. They are extremely Cheaply made and very uncomfortable. I find a lot of things off of Amazon and this is one of the worst. Buyer beware!,1,0,5
Very comfortable. Use it for gym. Love the colors,5,1,5
These were very comfortable and didn‚Äôt make my feet hurt I use them at work and they were perfectly fine and then I went to a golf tournament and they were soaked in water from being on the grass but nothing too bad,5,1,5
They are very comfortable and have a roomy fit in the toe area. This is the first time I‚Äôve ordered shoes online because I always felt I need to see them and try them on first. So I was very leery. But I was pleasantly surprised. They are exactly what I expected.,5,1,5
"These shoes are not very comfortable. I bought them for the gym but my Adidas blow these out of the water. In addition, I ordered these on Cyber Monday. By Thursday when I received them, the price had decreased by $11... lol, what a joke. Isn‚Äôt cyber Monday supposed to be the biggest sale day of the year?? So I‚Äôm addition to not really loving the shoes, I‚Äôm going to return them just because Amazon tried to pull one over on me with the price!",2,0,5
"I'm a size 8.5 and I ordered up to a 9 just in case. Thank goodness I did! They still fit pretty well, but they're smaller than I expected. If I had to do it again, I'd either go a whole size up rather than just the half. That or just go to the store. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",4,1,5
I love the colors.,5,1,5
"Great fit, flexible and comfortable",5,1,5
"Fits a little loose on the heel.
Could use a bit more support on the back heel side cushions.
My second pair, use them for walking.",4,1,5
"I really like these shoes! They are comfortable, stylish and low profile. I do a lot of walking at my job and they have been great for that and to wear to the gym. I like the neutral color with a little accent color on the back!",5,1,5
Comfortable and light. I love it,5,1,5
It‚Äôs very comfortable and lightweight and with the inserts I bought my flat feet don‚Äôt hurt. The only thing is because they are so lightweight you can still stub your toeüòë otherwise I love this shoe.,5,1,5
Runs a little big. But very comfortable.,4,1,5
Love these shoes! Super comfy & light weight!,5,1,5
My daughter loves them. Extra comfortable she says,5,1,5
My girlfriend loves theses shoes they fit her just right and are very comfy she uses them for work and shes on her feet alot,5,1,5
I love the colors & they look great!,5,1,5
Love these!,5,1,5
I like the color. Love the blue Nike symbol below the laces. Fits well.,5,1,5
Terrible design that makes the tongue of the shoe flip in on both sides putting pressure on the top of your foot. Returned them,1,0,5
Shoe was not with enough support being a nike my other nikes from big 5 much more support especially in the ankle are,3,0,5

"These shoes look good but like some other reviews mentioned: the top of the shoe really digs into your foot. I did an 8-hr work shift on my feet all day, but it cut off circulation to my left foot, and I had numbness in my toes for a couple of hours.

Ended up returning it the same day (after cleaning and disinfecting them first, of course).",1,0,5
"I love this shoes, they feel amazing for working out and walking and so light",5,1,5
It‚Äôs light weight and looks good but unfortunately too narrow for my wide feet,3,0,5

My Mom love this shoes,5,1,5
I wore these shoes three times and the eyelet came loose on the top lace. Do not buy these shoes!!!!,1,0,5
"Well fitted supportive shoes.. a bit tight around your foot similar to shocks. I‚Äôm satisfied though!! Bought mainly for my sweatpants says and working out. Wore for 12 hours and my right pinky toe was rubbed a little sore not sure why but it is prob my foot rather than the shoe itself ? Anyway I‚Äôm happy and love the color! They are very flexible too, as I‚Äôve shown in the picture. The inside doesn‚Äôt have extra cushion but if you purchase a gel insert I‚Äôd bet these would be heaven. I‚Äôd recommend to others. They also arrived on time.",4,1,5
"I have always been a fan of Nike, they never dissapoint! This pair of shoes are so comfortable and light weight. After having my old pair of Nike runner for almost 7 years (they last sooo long!) I decided to get a new pair. I couldn't find a similar ones but this pair is really close~ turned out to be very nice!",4,1,5
"These are perfect. Got was right on, they look amazing and I use them for working out. They are lightweight and so comfortable. Will buy again!",5,1,5

Excelente,5,1,5
Porq me gusta,5,1,5
They fit her well,5,1,5
My feet lol,5,1,5
Seams on the side of the shoe were in a weird location and did not feel comfortable on my foot. The tongue was very large and the location of the laces on the tongue made them awkward to pull tight. I ended up returning them.,2,0,5
"Size was stated as UK size, but what arrived was US size! So 2 sizes too small!",1,0,5
"Tit, snug fit, wear it with socks for better comfort. Pretty color, but the sole is hard, no memory foam. The part close to your toes is a bit hard too, not soft and fabric-ish.

The ankle support is good, fits good but there is a little empty space in front of your toes.

Overall decent buy",4,1,5
"It's like a first copy of d product
Disgusting product .. even already used item is handover to me .. packaging is worst .. I don't expect this kind or delivery from Amazon .. very disappointing",4,1,5
Excellent purchased these for my sister. She has been down and out so they gave her the extra lift that she needed.,5,1,5

Great product!,5,1,5
I always wear 5.5 with Nike but this purchase and model is too small and very uncomfortable,5,1,5
good product,5,1,5
Aulthough product was good but i am dissapointed with packing very bad packing,4,1,5
"I usually don't write reviews but this manufacturing company deserves it. I purchased a size 12 and was sent a size 6. So then I returned it and waited for them to send me the correct size. I received the new pair, long and behold it was another size 6 and at the point I was over it. The shoes was in American size so there was no conversion.....never again",1,0,5
I work 12 hour days on my feet with high arches and run on my days off. These are the only shoe I‚Äôve found that can manage both activities without foot pain. I had the 2017 version last me a year before I got these and they still hold up.,5,1,5
"Have had these for a little while now, needless to say they have been feeling great! I run 3 to 4x a week and these hold up really well. I also am a teacher, so on casual Fridays these come in handy with jeans and a hoodie.",5,1,5
These shoes are comfortable but aren‚Äôt the same color as pictured . They‚Äôre more of a bright coral/pink but other than that they‚Äôre manageable .,3,0,5
"Too small. Not sure these are real Nikes. I‚Äôve never needed anything bigger than 8.5 in Nike, and I needed a 9.5 in this shoe. I had to return. They didn‚Äôt have any common sizes to trade out with. Pretty disappointing.",1,0,5
"I love these shoes, I have foot and ankle issues and these cradle my foot perfectly and help keep the form I need to rehabilitate my Achilles tendon. Spacious through the toes and tight through the arc and heal.
Would recommend for runners with foot issues. Beautiful color also.",5,1,5
Great product. But way over priced. I paid $50 for them before. But now they are not available anywhere the seller decided to put the price up so high $150. But because they are so comfortable I paid it.,5,1,5
"Very comfortable. A perfect fit.
A little tough to get them on, but once they are on my feet they are very comfortable. Shoe lace likes to come untied, I just put a double knot",5,1,5
These are super comfy and have a nice toe bed and the arch feels great!! I ordered up a 1/2 size and they fit perfect!,5,1,5
"Normally wears a 7.5. Way too small. Have to pay over $5 to return.. Like the shoe, but runs really small Ordered and waiting on the 8.5.",3,0,5
"The colors are slightly different from what I expected in the photo‚Äîboth colors seem lighter. But nonetheless, I love this line from Nike and think the colors are unique. I have wider feet and these fit great, they give a little and don‚Äôt crowd my toes.",4,1,5
My favorite Nike is the 2017 RN but this one is close,5,1,5
"Super comfortable and when walking feels like I‚Äôm not carrying something heavy.
Also the color on these shoes are really nice",5,1,5
