Comfortable show but quantity in mesh material is lacking. Tongue ripped after 2 months of use. Unable able to return on amazon.,1,0,28
"Pros: Lightweight, comfortable, great fit, and most importantly they are amazingly breathable.

Cons: You will get rocks stuck in your shoe. The only safe place to run with these is indoor tracks or treadmills.
My image above is after a 3 mile run on a path the changed from pavement to gravel. The worst part, are the thin cracks that are super hard to cleanout.

Do not buy unless you only plan to use these indoors.",3,0,28
"Lightest, most-comfortable Nikes ever. I use these for casual wear; so I can‚Äôt speak as to how they would hold up for running. But for casual wear, they‚Äôre great! Especially for warmer temps. Full disclosure: This is my second pair (my first pair was from another retailer) and the only reason I hesitated this long to purchase another is that the first pair squeak while walking, depending on the floor surface (certain types of tile/linoleum/floor wax?). No problem with this pair thankfully though, oddly enough. Thought I should at least mention it as a possibility though. Overall, great shoes‚Äîlove these even over the 2018 version.
Update (Oct 2019): This pair began to squeak shortly after purchase while walking too. I'm starting to believe it's just an (unacceptable) design flaw. Took off two stars for the squeaking while walking (it's that bad). Ended up purchasing a pair of New Balance 990v5's instead-- no squeaking while walking, AND better arch support (admittedly with inserts provided by 'Lucky Feet' shoe store)! I just use these Nike's for long-distance driving now.",3,0,28
"Standard for all my reviews: When reviewing products, I always remain objective and honest about the product or service. I always review with information that I feel others would like to know about the product as I always assume what I'm writing will influence for or against the purchase. I always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality, value and application. Most importantly, I will always end the review with an answer as to whether I'd purchase the product again which I believe is the most critical question pertaining to the item. To manufacturers: Want me to review your items, just let me know!

I haven't been able to find my old Nike Flyknit shoes here on Amazon and have been on the hunt for fashionable, functional and light weight tennis/running shoes. When I go cheaper, I'm nearly always disappointed. After a lot of searching I landed on these. As is usually the case, some of the colors I want are out of stock in my size so I got the black/white combination, which is really more gray ... what I was looking for.

They are very light, almost a mesh material and fit perfectly. Looks-wise, they were very close to what I was looking for and I'm really pleased with how light they are and how well they fit. I'm not a runner (bad knees) but wanted something versatile to where for walking or just casually going out. Some have reported rocks getting stuck in the tread holes but I haven't had that issue myself.

Hearing that Nike is pulling out of Amazon, I'm inclined to purchase another set of these shoes but figured other resellers would sell through Amazon. Regardless, really happy with the look and functionality of these shoes. Exactly what I was looking for. A bit on the more expensive side but I've learned I have to get north of $100 to get the shoes that fit my desires.

Would definitely purchase these again!",5,1,28
"These shoes had been worn and returned by someone before I got them. Probably returned because of the incessant squeaking. But they are very, very comfortable and I will try buying another pair. Hopefully they will not have been worn and won't squeak!

OK, ordered a second pair hoping they had not been previously worn and didn‚Äôt squeak. Received them in two days from ordering. They had NOT even worn previously which is a plus. And they are very comfortable. However, and the reason I only gave them four stars is they are still very noisy. Squishing and squeaking with every step. You could not refer to these shoes as sneakers because you would never be able to sneak up on anyone with all the racket they make! But I love them anyway.",4,1,28
"I loved this shoe. I had gotten a pair of Free Runs a couple years back and needed another,so I got this pair and the tongue ripped 2 months in. They were extremely comfortable and I did everything I could to baby them. I would wipe them down after every use and sit in from of a fan to air dry. Never used more than 2 hours at a time and never gotten wet. Then one day I decide to slip them on and ***RIIIIIPPPPP*** the tail got ripped in half. A design flaw in an otherwise great shoe.",2,0,28
"Look these sneakers.
Exactly what i wanted got 2 pairs..",4,1,28
The shoes are very comfortable but I am upset about the 25 dollar increase on price when I returned the 9 and ordered the 9.5. To go from 113.00 to 137.00 seems like highway robbery. Also do not use these shoes on a small rock surface. The rocks get caught in the sole of the shoe.,4,1,28
"Got these for my son who has flat feet and is prone to foot pain if shoes are tight around the tendon at the back of his foot. These shoes are really light and the back are very flexible, so they are comfortable enough for him to stand at work all day. I've bought the women's version for my daughter who is in nursing with the same results. Fantastic shoes!",5,1,28
"Shoes look and fit right, however the bottom of the shoes is shapes so that small rocks and pebbles always gets stuck in them and while running you can feel these rocks and pebbles. I take them out, and they refill (see photo). Not a good design at all, otherwise the shoe is okay. I have an older pair of flynit nike shoes, and those were much better overall design.",1,0,28
"Shoes were fine. Fabric wasn‚Äôt what I expected, not through deception, just hard to see on the screen. I sent back for a refund unworn. $76 ‚Äúrestocking fee‚Äù. Thanks, that‚Äôs not how good companies operate. No one should do business like that, and I will be filling out reviews here and all the applicable other sites.",1,0,28
"I wished Nike had not discontinued this model, they don‚Äôt have any thing to replace it :)",4,1,28
"I bought these shoes specifically for travelling. I like to run while I am on the road for work and needed a pair that were both comfortable to run with, but also lightweight and most importantly could be squished down very flat for easy carry-on packing. I have been very happy so far with these shoes. They are pretty stylish, very comfortable to run in, and most importantly extremely light and compact.",5,1,28
Right Now I Was Looking At The Way it was made closely and I have To Give Them a Highly Accurately Detailed Bottom Sole Excellent Comfort!,5,1,28
I bought these for light jogging/gym and casual wear. After a day of break in these feel like socks on your feet. They fit true to size and feel supportive. Mind you im not running a marathon in these but for straight jogs on a road or track these are more than adequate. Bought a second pair and a few other colors I liked them so much.,5,1,28
Best shoes on the planet. Nike sucks for changing the style. I hate the new model.,5,1,28
"Hawt Dawg, these are good. I wear them to the gym. I wear them running. I wear them to your moms house. What more can you ask for?",5,1,28
"These a super light and very comfortable shoes. I normally wear an 11, but like other similar Nike shoes I wear an 11.5, and these were the same. Fit great, feel great, my new favorite casual shoe.",5,1,28
"I bought these shoes for my boyfriend. We are always biking, running, lifting... you name it. He says that the shoes feel like slippers, they are light weight, and breathable. I would definitely buy them again!",5,1,28
"It seems like with these new models company tries to use less and less material for new sneakers, soon we will be attaching just a bottom part of the shoe to the foot and go for run with Nike label, Just Do it Bro!
LOLüòÜ
But other than that all is perfect üëå",5,1,28
These are wonderful shoes very light and comfy. Seller was awesome they seem as legit as they can be I own like 5 pairs of these since they came out I just compare them. If anyone says these shoes rip it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre supposed to tie and untie them every time also don‚Äôt fall which is pretty hard these.,5,1,28
"This is the best sneaker Nike ever made, lightweight but with lots of support for walking. I wish they had more colors to choose from.",5,1,28
"I have feet that lived in military boots for many years and had developed bunions. Many shoes have become too uncomfortable to wear but these are the exception. The flyknit fabric is forgiving on pressure points, and when worn casually, the shoes last a long time.",5,1,28
"These are lightweight and good looking, but are completely lacking in support and treads for real runners. $125 is just too expensive for a indoor gym workout shoe.",1,0,28
The fit was true to size. I think the shoe is not up to Nike quality I have come to expect. I know this is a minimalist running shoe but it has very little side to side support. Just not a good workout shoe. It is fine for just kicking around and walking but lacks the kind of stability I expect from a serous running shoe.,3,0,28
"This is a very comfortable shoe, but it did not last long. The toe area where the fabric met the sole of the shoe came apart after the second month. It started with a little tear and then got worse. They need to reinforce this show with extra stitches.,Then it would be a great shoe",2,0,28
Going to return. This tennis shoes does not feel like an engineered Nike product. Feels cheap and uncomfortable.,2,0,28
"Well designed, very good looking shoe. Price is also right as compared to other shoes like it that are selling for $50 more. The shoe is very light and at the initial wear it is slightly tight.",5,1,28
"I love these shoes, best fit for my foot ever. Too bad they are getting hard to find! Durable, light and can be worn as a tennis shoe or slipper style! This is my 5th pair.",5,1,28
Ive owned a few of these shoes and im so glad yall have them here since they‚Äôre a little hard to find because these shoes are from 2018. Thank you I‚Äôll buy more before they run out,5,1,28
The perfect shoe for my flat feet. This is my second pair. Unfortunately Nike does not make them anymore. I am not a fan of the replacement Nike Free Runs. This version is for those who like the bear foot approach.,5,1,28
I buy a pair now and then when I can find them. These were the best designs Nike ever made for those of us in hot areas like Arizona.,5,1,28
"If you're looking for sneakers that fit like a glove, these are it. Nike should've never stopped making these! I bought another pair for backup because I love them so much. In my opinion, you should go a half size down to get that sock-like fit.",5,1,28
Every year my son-in-law asks me to get him a new pair. I guess he likes them!!,5,1,28
"I purchased these for my son. He likes them, says they are comfortable, and light. He wears them to workout. The sizing was correct.",5,1,28
"Great shoes for walking ‚Äî lightest walking shoes I‚Äôve used. Went 5 1/2 miles on my first walk ‚Äî no issues. I was worried about ordering these shoes as my feet are wide, so I ordered a 1/2 size larger ‚Äî perfect fit. Extremely satisfied",5,1,28
Literally broke by tying the shoelaces. That's some real cheap quality for a Nike shoe.,1,0,28
"El calzado me queda muy bien, es mi talla perfecta, adem√°s es liviano y se trota muy bien con ellos.",5,1,28
"Gave them as a gift to our son. He thinks they are the best running shoes he has ever had. According to him, they are the most comfortable shoes he owns!",5,1,28
"I‚Äôve always wanted a pair of fly knits and these delivered perfectly very comfortable, breathable and fashionable",5,1,28
The mesh broke while trying to tie shoelaces - Poor quality,1,0,28
"My son is on the Army
And his drill Sargent recommended them. He has hardly taken them off. He loves them",5,1,28
"Got these for everyday use with short pants and considering my skinny legs. They look really nice and are light and easy to wear on and off. Fit is a little tight, if unsure go for a larger size.",5,1,28
"Got these for my dad for his birthday. He loves them! They have a stretchy tongue for his big arch, (runs in the family) and they are awesome!",5,1,28
This is a very good running shoe the material there constructed of allows ventilation to your feet so you don't sweat in the shoe. They're very light and super comfortable I paid about $110 for these during the Amazon sale.,5,1,28
"Feels great when exercising or just going around ‚Äòrunning‚Äô errands, no pun intended. If you‚Äôre new to FlyKnits try these! Cool color selection as always. Super super comfortable! A bit pricey but worth it.",5,1,28
"Nike shoes are running short. I tried many. At least 1/2 a size. I'm a 11 1/2 in a good running shoe so I had to get a size 12, this is why the toe box is a little wide but it will due for a every day shoe in a warm climate. This is not a running shoe.",4,1,28
"Been using Nike Frees for many years. These were great fit, comfortable, lightweight yet enough padding for shock absorption. The only reason I gave them a 4 star is because they squeak too much.",4,1,28
"True to size; very breathable; very comfortable. Provides a more natural run, so make sure you're used to running in a shoe with a minimal heel-toe drop before you try to rock and roll on a marathon.",5,1,28
I have run with the pairs about 30 miles. I liked the lite feel and fit.,4,1,28
love these shoes. Mesh makes it super airy so feet don't get sweaty. All day comfort,5,1,28
"Perfect fit, feel, everything!

"I work at a home improvement center, on my feet for 8 hours a day, constantly on the move. These shoes keep my feet happy. These are the third pair of Free RN flyknit I have purchased over the past two years and even the 1st pair is still in good shape. Thanks Nike for a great product.",5,1,28
Son muy Comodos perfectos para el caminar diario.,5,1,28
One Of The Best Shoes You Can Ever Own! If you don't own this shoes you do not know what you are missing. The best summer shoes ever.,5,1,28
Ok,5,1,28
"Overall, I love this shoe. It is lightweight, breathable, and great for running. However, one issue to be aware of: if walking on granite or small stones, they will get lodged in the sole, which is kind of a bummer. Also, it can be squeaky on certain surfaces.",4,1,28
Husband loved this shoe. He‚Äôs recieved compliments. Box came mangled but the shoes were in new condition!,5,1,28

"great price for the right product, bought these as a gift and they were exactly the right match to nike.",5,1,28
"After 3 months, the shoes ripped and could not be worn for running/exercise. A little crazy that $100+ shoes hold up for such a short period of time.",1,0,28
"Great breathability, very little rubber on the bottom though. Overall, very comfortable, I wouldn't use it to run in though. not enough support",5,1,28
"Very strage, both are 11.5 but the right shoe is a 2-3mm longer than the left one. Very disappointed, seems like they are fake. Can't believe Nike would produce shoes with such an error",1,0,28
Good,5,1,28
Very light and comfortable,5,1,28
"I love these sneakers! Decided to buy a second pair, they're very light and great for hot summer days. Fit as expected.",5,1,28

"A great shoe, but not as good as the previous version",4,1,28
"My one issue is that they make an odd noise when I walk (picture walking in wet shoes), to the point that people have told me they can hear me approaching. I like the comfort and fit of the shoes a lot but I would have picked a different shoe had I known. And it is not an isolated thing, I bought two pairs and they both make the noise.",3,0,28

So confortable for running and cool color,5,1,28
I received a pair of used shoes instead of a brand new pain of 2018 free run fly knits. absolutely unacceptable. Beware of who you buy from.......I thought this was a nike purchase guess not.,1,0,28
Excellent shoes. Very light and comfortable while running. Highly recommend for runners,5,1,28
I thought I was buying a pair of shoes. Instead it seems these are now a political statement. I wish I had not purchased them.,1,0,28
"I bought these shoes directly from Nike. They are comfortable, relatively cool, and seem like they will last. The only big flaw is the soles: they pickup gravel every time I wear them outside, and it takes an awl to pry it all out. I bought them primarily to wear at my camp in Maine, and it turns out that pea gravel is a big part of our ecosystem here. Who knew? Now, every time I step into the camp I have to take them off or clear them of hitch hikers, lest I completely ruin our 50 year old pine floors. It a nuisance, but more than that it's a real disappointment in what otherwise would be a very good shoe. I imagine for indoor alone use they'd be fabulous, but I live in the world where stuff happens outdoors too. I can't imagine what Nike's designers were thinking.",3,0,28
"These sneakers are great, extremely light and have good support. The material looks to be very breathable and it fits snugly around my ankle and foot. The soles are flexible and have great traction.",5,1,28
"So far so good. I have run 40 miles in these, I use them exclusively for running, on asphalt pavement, and I like them a lot. They have a good feel on the road. I am a forefoot striker (except when I am tired :) and I am not sure they would do as well for a heel-striker. To me, they feel like they are designed for the forefoot.

Before these I was running in Nike Free Run 5.0s ‚Äì I loved those so much that I bought 6 pair when Nike phased them out. But these Free Rn Flyknits ‚Äì They make me get up and go.",5,1,28
"These sneakers have been my everyday shoes, and I have another pair I run in. They have served me well in both capacities. Super comfortable, extremely breathable and cool, but still well supported. Only drawbacks are that the material is so breathable that if you get them wet, you are instantly soaked through to the socks, so not great for running after or during rain. Rocks also get stuck in the tread of the shoe every so often, but this never bothered me much.",5,1,28
"I use these shoes for everything that I do rock climbing, mountain biking, longboarding, hiking and just everyday use and I can confidently say these are the lightest most comfortable most breathable shoes I've ever worn.. I'm on my second pair going to get my 3rd they last about a year to year and a half of really rough wearing",5,1,28
I'm not a brand fanboi of any brand. I bought these at the Nike outlet in Boston in 2018. It's 2020 now. I've probably ran about 1000 miles in them and hiked several mountains and rugged trails with my dog over 2 years. They're in amazing shape still. I'm on Amazon right now to buy 2 more pairs like Elaine stockpiling sponges.,5,1,28
"This nike shoe is just brilliant. I am buying this for the second time, black with anthracite color goes well with every occasion, active or casual with jeans/shorts blue black whatever. Love this shoe, I ran extensively averaging about 50miles a week for about 10 months. The shoe is still in good shape but I bought another one before it gets discontinued.",5,1,28

"Absolutely the best running shoe i have ever bought. Light, soft, and with the holes all around my feet breath like i was barefooted. Only thing is I bought them for 120 at the mall, THE MALL! Why are the so expensive on amazon?",5,1,28
Worst Nike shoes I have ever owned! Nike quality and comfort is definitely lost in theses shoes.,1,0,28
Probably the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned.,5,1,28

"These are not for running. ‚ÄúFree RN‚Äù is misleading. They should be named ‚ÄúFree casual.‚Äù

"My son got a pair of these in 2018 and hung onto them a year and they were worn on the soles. The fabric is sturdier than it looks, no problem with wear to the fabric and they washed up well in the washing machine. Then, he replaced them recently with a hard soled Nike with carbon inset which was absolutely horrible. He is athletic and jogged 5 miles wearing the new shoes and wound up having to go to urgent care since he couldn't put weight one the foot and bruised the base of the foot. Those shoes went back to Nike and we bought another pair of these shoes. They are very light and the sole is flexible.",5,1,28
"Wear this shoe all the time and over a year later. Still has everything in tact with no fraying of any sort. Easy to clean. Very very comfortable. I usually wear a 9.5 but got a 9 thinking it would run big. It does not. Buy what size you normally buy! I got a half size too small and it‚Äôs pretty tight. My feet fit okay because it‚Äôs nice and stretchy for that, but definitely tighter than I anticipated. Get your ‚Äúregular‚Äù shoe size- don‚Äôt go to the smaller size of you fit kind of in between. Overall, could not be happier with them.",5,1,28
I love this shoe so much! I‚Äôm a woman‚Äôs 8.5 (but 9 in Nike bc they run small) and got a men‚Äôs 7.5 and it‚Äôs my favorite shoe ever!!! So cozy! It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm wearing a sock with arch support.,5,1,28
"These shoes fit like a glove. Perfect for running, walking and the rest. I have a lot of problems when I get ill-fitting shoes and at first I thought that these were too tight, but they are comfortable and so light. Couldn't be more pleased with them.",5,1,28
I recently bought the Nike Men's Free RN Flyknit Running Shoes. They are very comfortable and light and the fit is nice. It remains to be seen how durable they are.,5,1,28

Husband loved the fit,5,1,28
"Le encanto a mi pareja, esta super contento con sus tenis",5,1,28
"I love the way the trainers look, and they are pretty breathable. But there is a rubber band on the heel, giving the heel structure, this rubs and inevitably led to blistering on both heels after only 2 miles of walking. The soles of the trainers also easily enable stones/rocks to get stuck in them which I had to remove with a sharp object countless times during my walk.",2,0,28
Great Nike free shoes. It‚Äôs a shame that Nike no longer produce these and new frees look very different,5,1,28
These were a gift for my son. He really likes them and says the fit like a glove and was actually very surprised that I bought the right size. His shoe size can vary between a 7 and an 8 so I took a guess and went for the 7.5 and they are a perfect fit.,5,1,28

"Got these for my husband as a Christmas gift. He likes the shoe but it was a little snug, which is why we usually try shoes on before buying them. However with Covid that‚Äôs harder to do now. He would probably get a half size larger if we knew it would be a tight fit. But, he loves the feel and look of the shoe.",5,1,28
Item runs very narrow for a normal D width. Size up if you can or pass on this purchase,3,0,28
Came quick. Shoes felt good after first few times. Noticed right exterior sole has come apart from shoe after about 6 miles of normal walking. Nike sign is worn off and inside tag is suspect of this show not actually being real. Size 12 but the left is more of a 13 and the right is a 11.,2,0,28
Look good but the design is poor. every time I wear these sneakers the top of my foot gets irritated because the internal stitching is rubbing and causing an irritation.,2,0,28
I got the 10.5 W for men but the fit me tie. I have to return them. They are very nice tho,5,1,28
"I wore these for 2 days assuming they could be stretched out, but instead it chaffed and ripped some skin from the front of my ankle. The angle of the toes is too narrow and feels like your big toe is being pushed towards your other toes.",3,0,28
"My son loves these Nike shoes. They sold out where we were going to get them. Then I saw Amazon had them. He's worn them many times. Loves the look of them, the stripe at the side. His fourth pair of Nikes. It's all he'll wear. Teenagers...",5,1,28
"This is my 4th try at Nike and regardless of the size or width I select they are way too tight across the top of the foot. I usually wear an 8.5. I've tried size 8.5 in two different styles, size 9, and a size 8.5 wide and all are too tight across the top of the foot. What's going on with Nike??? I've worn them for years running and to the gym and have always found a comfortable pair that fit fine!",1,0,28
"True to size and comfortable. The shoe really looks good in the pictures, but better in person.",5,1,28
The shoe is really tight-fitting and tore up my heel to the point I haven‚Äôt worn them in over a week while my heel heals. Hoping the stretch a bit or I‚Äôll be returning them.,3,0,28

"I've been a runner for the past thirty years. In that time, I've worn lots of running shoes, but I've never worn a pair of shoes that I would write a review for. Sure- folks have told me about buying a certain pair of shoes, and how awesome they were. So I went out and bought them, and they were OK. But these shoes are amazing. I like them so much that I often use them for just walking (which as a runner, I know I'm not supposed to do...I don't care. I like them that much). Bottom line- this is a phenomenal shoe, so much so, that I had to write this review.",5,1,28
"I bought these for my boyfriend in size 9 1/2 which he has another Nike but they were too tight. I re-ordered them in size 10 and they fit perfectly. He loves these and I also love all the Nike Zoom athletic shoes, they are the most comfortable and best for walking.",4,1,28
"Size chart is not correct. According to this size chart US 10 corresponds to 27.1 cm, but in reality it is 28 cm.",1,0,28
"They look and feel great, and do appear to be excellent for running. I normally order a half size up for my running and sports shoes which I did in this case; they still feel quite snug even without socks on!

"My NIKE Air Zooms Pegasus 37‚Äôs -ROCK!

"This is my second pair of Nike Pegasus, the first pair lasted two years. I got these new ones two months ago and have yet to be able to walk in them without my feet hurting. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs too much your feet sit too high in them and the right side squeezes your foot. I‚Äôve worn the same size Nike shoes for 10+ years and have never had an issue. These things are $100+ that will just sit in the close until donated one day. I would suggest getting an older version of these or just something else period.",1,0,28
I received this item with a rather large Yellow stain on thr right upper show. I'm trying to get it out because I'm not one to complain but this was quite a bit of money to spend,4,1,28

"I own the Nike Zoom Pegasus 37 BQ9646-011.
I had high hopes that this would finally be a shoe that was as good as my old Pegasus 30.

I'm an amateur runner that does races for fun and need a shoe that above all else will PROTECT ME. I don't need a shoe that is 10 micro grams lighter to that I can beat Eliud Kipchoge. I just need something that is strong, well cushioned and will protect my feet, knees and back from the rigors of long distance running.

Regarding this shoe: At first I tried it and felt a bit weird when running. It seems the support is more towards the middle of the shoe than on the heel. Then, as others have also reported, the shoe started causing me pain in the tendon right over my heels. The pain got worse and worse. So I had to stop using them. (And they're expensive)

Today I tried on my 8 year old Pegasus 30, and not only did they provide much better support, my feet felt much firmer. And the pain caused by the other shoes was not present, even though my tendon still feels tender. It's odd that a worn out shoe performed better and protects me better than this new model.

Nike if you're reading this: please go back to making excellent running shoes like the Pegasus 30. And stop doing the ""Apple"" thing and ruining a perfectly good performing shoe with versions like the 37. I'll happily buy a 30 again.. I just can't find one.",1,0,28
These are too loose a fit in the front/toe box; compared to the Air zoom Pegasus 35 running shoes I usually get in the same size; they are all great fitting shoes.,2,0,28
"I've been using my Vomero 14 Running shoes for 2 years now and they have not show any signs of damage etc. I've decided to take a chance on these Peg 37 as I was hoping to get the Peg 36 and I am not disappointed at all.

These shoes look good, are very comfortable and they fit my feet perfectly. I've only went for 2 short runs so far and I really do like the feel of them.

I will see how long they last, but I would definitely recommend the Peg 37.",5,1,28
I hated Nike for years. Great cushion and feel with these Peg 37‚Äôs. They‚Äôre pretty amazing. They will make your feet look longer because of the back sticks out. You will feel like a rooster or crow because of the back. Who cares.,5,1,28
Great runing shoes they supper light,5,1,28
Buena amortiguaci√≥n,5,1,28
Lo que esperaba,5,1,28
"El producto llego bien y con un buen empaquetado. El talle un poco justo, deber√≠a haber comprado un 14,5 en su lugar. La entrega fue en menos tiempo que el indicado.",5,1,28
"I have been wearing Nike Pegasus for running for the last 15-20 years. It has always been my go to option for comfort. The Pegasus 37 though seems to be a complete redesign which is actually killing my feet every time I wear them.

Nike Pegasus have always been suited to neutral attenuation feet but these don't seem to be. When running, or even just walking in them the tension causes pain in the arches of the feet.

Looking at the soles of the shoes there is a outer rim of dark rubber obviously designed to absorb pressure but even after wearing them just a few times I can see wear in the central hollow of the shoes. This means that the un-cushioned central area is the part coming into contact with the ground.

Another clear design floor is the back of the shoe which is lower than normal and tapered. I'm not sure why Nike felt the need to have a pointed end at the back of the shoe but it means the heel does not feel fully cushioned or supported and has a tendency to slip up and down.

I am really shocked at how badly designed these running shoes are and I can only advise others to avoid them like the plague.",5,1,28
"Like walking on marshmallows! I‚Äôve rubbish feet (flat, thin heel and ball pads), these runners are a godsend for keeping me comfortable through the day. I use a standing desk and have been avoiding running because I‚Äôve had bad luck with runners having soles that are too firm. Not these guys - these are supremely comfortable.",1,0,28
Recently taken up running through the Covid lock down and after a few weeks of running on an entry level Karrimor trainer I decided I needed to upgrade. Didn't want to spend a fortune so spent time reading reviews and decided upon these. I'm finding them really excellent and making a massive difference to any aches and pains I used to get after running. It feels like I'm running on air when I've got them on and definitely made the right choice. Amazon were the cheapest even compared to the Nike on-line store with discount. Delivery was excellent too. All in all I'm massively happy with these.,5,1,28
"My initial thoughts on this trainer was they were amazing. My son was comfortable from the get go.
Not even three months on and they've fallen apart. Yes he is a boy but he isn't rough on his things. His school shoes have lasted him all year as has his other branded trainer. Not worth the money.. Do not buy this product if you'd like them to last",4,1,28
"I did read the reviews on these and some can be a little off putting, I am a regular running about 25 miles a week.
I love these shoes, they are great, I tend to heal strike so can honestly say I think the design of these are great. I found these very comfortable right from the first run.
I can definitely recommend these shoes.",1,0,28
"They're the first running shoes I've ever bought and with all the great reviews I thought they'd be perfect. They're ok. They're very narrow, too narrow, wish there was more space as I'm going further and further with them and my feet are starting to swell now and I thought they'd be more cushioned, even over time. I think they're probably better for sprinting but not jogging. They look amazing though, I really like the design. I just think there's probably better running shoes out there, especially for the price.",5,1,28
"As always Nike Pegasus is a great running shoe with good support and cushioning. Not to mention very flashy in this colour scheme.
However I am concerned that some years in Nike shoes I take an UK size 8.5 and other years I take a size 9.",5,1,28
"Good cushioning particularly on heel.
Having the store called '5 UK' will lose it some orders as it could be mistaken for 'size 5 UK' and people like certainty when ordering",5,1,28
"Had to return these as my son didn't like the way they stick out at the back, they have pointy sole at the back that looks daft. Shame as otherwise they would have been great.",1,0,28
"Came a day early. Instant fit for a size nine. I sometimes fit 8.5 but have wide feet so went for the 9uk. Perfect fit. No issues with first run out the box, instantly more comfortable than I had been use to you really feel the front air pocket which is great, I was able to run a 5k pb even after running the same route earlier in the day. Very pleased",5,1,28
Very small returned but no refund from amazon even after 20 days. Very bad support from amazon even after multiple followups . more than 20 days over now and still aask me to wait for more than 25 days,1,0,28
The shoes arriving was a great surprise as they turned up about a week earlier than the order told me so full marks there.

Easily the best pair of running shoes I have purchased. The cushioning is fantastic and I don't have nearly as much pain when running in these compared to my previous pairs,5,1,28
Amazing neutral running shoe. The cushioning is extraordinary and helps enormously with downhill run segments.,5,1,28
Brilliant running shoes.,5,1,28
"Got sent the wrong size but luckily still fits, great all round running shoe. Just need the right size next time!!!",3,0,28
"Fits quite snug, not much to say but okay for me in size 13",5,1,28
"Great running shoes! Everything as expected, comfortable running",5,1,28
Love them,5,1,28
"Original Nike shoes. Perfect fit. 99% similar to Pegasus 38 but at half the price. No sense of purchasing from official Nike stores, they charge 9995 for the same item.",5,1,28
"Shoes delivered 1 week and 1 day earlier than originally projected (to Ottawa, ON) when I purchased them - which was awesome. No extra import fees charged on delivery. Came without a Nike box, but other than that - excellent experience",5,1,28
Shoes are good for running and daily exercises,5,1,28
"The product is top notch... but than you expect it to be packed decently...
The packing is not upto the mark.
You would not believe its Nike product... Though product is Nike.",4,1,28
"Trop grand!
Acheter 7 si vous chaussez des 8 .",1,0,28
"Good Product, as expected",4,1,28
"Fake shoes, returned them as soon as I got it.",1,0,28
"I wear Nike running shoe size 11 across the board. When I got these, I was afraid they were a half size too big. It turns out, the toe box is just a little larger than most Nike running shoes. I run about a 5k a day in these and they're great. Like running on plushy clouds.

As others have said, probably not the best marathon shoe but it's great for everyday runs and exercises",5,1,28
"Cuando los compre ped√≠ me talla y dec√≠a que eran de mujer, cuando llegaron me quedaron 1 talla grande y dec√≠a que eran para hombre, entonces completamente mal la informaci√≥n y para el precio no me funcionaron üòû",3,0,28
"2nd pair I own and it fits great. Funny thing is, it says its for men, but Im a woman and it fits great for my narrow feet. Simply amazing!",5,1,28
"They do run a little narrow, but my long runs have never felt more smooth. Lightweight, tons of energy return, and they breathe better than any shoe I've worn before. I've seen some complaints about blisters on heels, but I haven't experienced that yet, may just be related to the runners' footstrike. 4/5 though, considering getting another pair while they're in stock.",4,1,28
I ordered a 9.5 what I am with every other shoes I've ever bought and this I can honestly barely put on. Super super tight 9.5. Chinese made junk like always thanks biden,1,0,28
These shows are very light and comfortable. They seem to have a high arch which fits me well but may not be suitable for everyone.,5,1,28
Excelente,5,1,28
They are soft and comfortable. They arrived on time. Worn by 16 year old active boy,5,1,28
Fits perfectly well. This is the second time I am purchasing this product and it does serve my needs excellently.,5,1,28
Very supportive. Probably the most comfortable shoe I have had.,5,1,28
Muy c√≥modas para hacer ejercicios.,5,1,28
"Great training shoe with front to back comfort and support, yet very light and wuick",5,1,28
"Absolutely amazing product. The shoes fit exactly as expected and it feels like I‚Äôm running on clouds. Better yet, the show box came the slightest bit ruffled, so the sellers added a complementary shoe freshener.",5,1,28
Very comfortable and light. Great for running or walking on pavement,5,1,28
"True to size fit dope,",5,1,28
"To protect your ankle, taller shoe paddings around ankle are needed",5,1,28
"Hi,

Great runners, very comfortable, very light.

BUT

The shoes wear very quickly so if value is important deduct ONE STAR",4,1,28
My 17 yr old loves these shoes he loves how comfortable they are. He says I should get a pair I've got horrible back pain. He thinks these would help.,4,1,28
"Very comfortable and easy on/off
Might slip a little on steep hills",4,1,28
Great shoes!!!!,5,1,28
Haven't try the shoes yet but would never expect to receive them in a damaged box just tied with a rubber band.,3,0,28
Son had gotten a pair 6 months ago and this is his second pair. Used for running and he loves them.,5,1,28
"Holy smokes what a shoe. Looks great, fits as expected, and really helps spring you forward on those long 10+ mile runs. I‚Äôd recommend these shoes to anyone training for distance races (half marathons, 25k‚Äôs, etc).",5,1,28
Great product. I enjoy them so much . Highly recommended,5,1,28
"Ped√≠ un 8.5 pero es 9 o 10, es muy grande",1,0,28
My son runs cross country and these are the only shoes he will wear. Heard style is now discontinued - good luck finding them! Hopefully Nike will bring them back.,5,1,28
Love the fit and the look.,5,1,28
FITS AS EXPECTED. COMFY. LIGHT. GREAT F0R WORKING OUT AND TRAVEL.,5,1,28
Really nice kicks. Fits very well as expected.,5,1,28
"I looked everywhere for this colorway! Excellent shoe fits great, comfortable and looks amazing! Shipped quicker than expected, that‚Äôs always a plus!",5,1,28
Very comfortable. Fits true to size,5,1,28
"Shoes look great, fit great, and came a little bit faster than the projected ETA.",5,1,28
"Got them today, kicks looks sexy af, it even arrived a few days early :)",5,1,28
These are absolutely the best running shoes i‚Äôve ever had in my life!!,5,1,28
Excelente producto,5,1,28
The fit is awesome. They are very comfortable sneakers.,5,1,28
Ok,5,1,28
Perfect as I thought üëåüèª,5,1,28
The colors and design,5,1,28
"Don‚Äôt buy this shoe, they will harm your feet really bad the pictures are from a half marathon I used them before the marathon to soft them but is useless. Expensive and not good for long distances even if you use a longer sock to avoid the section that haves contact with your skin.",1,0,28
"I get compliments like crazy, very comfortable. I own a solid blue pair that are 2 yrs old and they're still comfy.",5,1,28
Excellent Product,5,1,28
I love these shoes for running! I run half marathons and these are my favorite for the price.,4,1,28
Para caminata,5,1,28
Great walking g shoe,5,1,28
This is a very comfortable runner,5,1,28
"Shoes are really comfortable and light weight, looks good but its tends to be more slippery on wet surfaces compared to other normal shoes.",3,0,28
Product doesn't feel like original nike brand,1,0,28
 Looks like local duplicates like gaffar market types,1,0,28
The fit and its comfort is just too good to be true.,5,1,28
"I am starting to love these shoes. It's hard to describe how they feel, but I would say that when you're walking or running, they have a little bit of forward bounce to help you along. One thing you need to watch out for is driving. The holes get caught on my brake so that I'm hitting the gas and the brake. They are very slippery on the pedals. Otherwise, they are very comfortable, they look cool, and they're very light. Now we just have to see if they last!",5,1,28
I had ordered two pair... one months back where the sneaker seemed a little to snug and not enough room to put on. The inner sole could have a little more cushion... the next pair was a better fit... I made sure I ordered 1/2 size bigger,5,1,28
They say you get what you pay for... I‚Äôd have paid more. Surprisingly comfortable and felt good on my knees that have and surgery. I was expecting to need a new gel insole and may get one anyways but these are well worth the money and look pretty well put together. After having 2 pair of ASICS fall apart on me that cost 3X as much I‚Äôm extremely happy,5,1,28
 The size is perfect I ordered a 10 and that is what I got. The do not wear comfortably at all I tried Nike insoles in them a little better but these shoes were going to cause blisters and feet problem for sure.,1,0,28
"I bought these shoes for work. I work in a factory so I needed something that wouldn‚Äôt wear down quick. The design on the bottom hurt my feet for a couple days, so I bought insoles for them and now they‚Äôre perfect.",4,1,28
"Love the color(s), how quickly they arrived and comfort insole. üòÅ I'll take them for a ""spin"" this weekend to confirm wear comfort; which is EXTREMELY important for this Healthcare workerü§ó",4,1,28
"I love these shoes, they are super comfortable and stylish. My kids spend a lot of money buying Jordan's . I personally can't buy into the hype. When my kids saw them, they did compliment me on them. I liked that they had them in all colors. I will order some of the other colors . I purchased them for comfort because I suffer from back pains, and they are super comfortable.",5,1,28
"I really like these sneakers! I needed a pair for the gym but didn‚Äôt want to pay crazy prices because I really don‚Äôt do cardio. I can‚Äôt speak for how they are as running shoes, but I found them very comfortable and also lightweight. They look great and it would be difficult to beat the price! Overall definitely recommended!",5,1,28
"Pros: Stylish, cool.
Cons: 5 pair eyelets instead of 6; no shock absorption - like wearing clogs.

The blades are made of a stiff ABS type plastic, if they were instead made using a stiff rubber (like used for engine mounts) they would be much more comfortable for athletic walking / running.",3,0,28
"Overall, I am not impressed with these shoes. The knit cloth material is about the only pro to these shoes, seemingly much better quality compared to the same style from the check company shoes. That's where the pros end. The plastic material feels super cheap. Think those springy looking soles are springy? Nope. Super stiff. The actual rubber on the bottom is super thin. And NO, these are NOT slip proof, nor resistant. The shoelaces seem like dollar store quality. As for the fit, for the length I found they were almost spot on. The width, they are super narrow. I have thin feet, and these are tight for me. Some people said you cannot remove the insoles, and that is false. Easily removable.

Tldr, you get less than what you pay for. Beware.",2,0,28
"These shoes were great to start out with. However, after less than 6 months, they started falling apart. I've now had them for less than a year and they've had to find their way to the trash because they're splitting and the insides are completely torn up. The worst part is, I really haven't been hard on them at all. I was using them primarily to have something more comfortable to wear at work, and I spend the vast majority of time at work sitting or standing for brief periods. I hadn't done much walking in them at all since I didn't want them getting trashed quickly from that sort of wear and tear. Ultimately, these are over priced, cheaply made junk. You're better off with a $10 pair of shoes from Walmart.",1,0,28
"I took a chance with these shoes after reading a lot of negative reviews, because there were also some pretty good ones, but the second I put them on and stood up they were pretty painful. I showed in the pictures why, they have big circles on the bottom of the shoe without any support, the one at the top of the shoe is about an half inch deep and you can feel the edges dig into your feet, I can only imagine how bad it would be once the soles get worn out. They were shipped in a bag so both shoes are deformed. Horrible purchase, returning them.",1,0,28
Shoes came in open plastic bag and one was missing the insole. Shoe was also very hard and not flexible or comfortable. They were also much smaller and did not measure the same as size chart on the site. I was very disappointed and promptly returned them.,1,0,28
"First off, the color is amazing and fit is spot on! However, comfort isn't what you may think. The sole of the shoe is VERY hard and has ZERO give. So if you are looking for a ""spring"" like shoe, these are not them! You could probably add a insole into the main part to help some with that. I have found (for me) these are pretty comfortable when I am up and walking around, but when standing in one place for too long......forget it! Feels like I'm standing on a brick. The shoes themselves are pretty heavy for what's sold as ""running"" shoes. I'm sure it's due to the thick material used in the soles. So if you're looking for light weight, keep looking. I usually wear Asics and these are no where near that (I didn't expect it to be). However, for the price these are great for occasional wear, but I wouldn't wear these to the hospital, for my 12+ hour shift. Overall, I would buy them for outside of work use.....the style and colors are so fun!",4,1,28
TOO SMALL. Ordered my size...what came was cute but way too small. Ordered the next size up and paid again only for the same small shoe to show up claiming to be a size larger. Not purchasing again...I guess I would have to order 3-4 sizes larger. I so wanted these to work out but returning both tomorrow. Thumbs down!!!,1,0,28
The bedding of the sneakers is too harsh and feels uncomfortable when walking/running with it. I don‚Äôt recommend it at all.,1,0,28
"they are some fancy looking shoes, but only if you are wearing them in sterile surroundings., all those cutouts and holes collect dust, stones, grass clippings, and as a city dweller, god forbid dog gifts....
The yellow sole is almost worn off in about six weeks time.
They are not good for running, very hard shoes,a s well as shallow and bit wobbly - the heal is quite narrrow and I have almost twisted my ankle tree four times...
June 15, 2021- added pictures‚Ä¶ as said earlier- wears down too fast‚Ä¶ too bad ..",3,0,28
" When you walk in the shoes it feel like there walking with you, felt like they would give my feet problems but did not hurt them at all the first day of trying them out at the house, so the first day of work I put some insole just to make sure my feet where not hurting and they felt good all day, big surprise to me, but as far as driving a car with these shoes on, please do not do it, they are slippery on the petals, these are some light weight, I wear a 10.5 to 11, I order a 10.5 and fit right like a Michael Jackson glove, overall I thank everyone who got back to me on the good reviews and the bad reviews, I switch back and forth with different pair of shoes so my big feet do not settle and hurt.",3,0,28
"Bought in January, and just over 2 months later, the soles are wearing out and the inside back by the heel has worn down to hard plastic and is rubbing a sore spot on the back of my heel and they can't be used any more.

I walk about 10,000 steps a day, sometimes up to 16,000 steps, so these got a good workout.

They were a bit large, which was surprising because I have wide Hobbit feet and I ordered a regular width 42 European size and that's usually a bit tight.

I got a lot of compliments on the style and the bright yellow! I did like the style, too, personally.

If you need serious walking shoes that will last more than 2 or 3 months, skip these. If you mostly sit or stand and don't rack up the mileage quickly (5-8 miles/day), these are a good option.",3,0,28
Many I‚Äôve seen on this website saying that these are great shoes! The shoes are made in China and sold through a distributor in this country. Comparing to other name sneakers these are total junk don‚Äôt waste your time and money spend the extra and get a comfortable light lasting shoe.,1,0,28
"I love these shoes! Inexpensive, comfortable, stylish, fun to wear, and good quality materials used to make them. I'm on my third day wearing them, they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time like work or school. I love all the color combinations they come in, and considering getting another pair since they are all-season shoes. I am a weirdo who prefers not to have a name brand or logo on my shoes or clothes, so that is another plus.
A Great buy, I highly recommend, just hope they stand the test of time.",5,1,28
I didn‚Äôt have a problem with the shoes quality other than them hurting my feet. So I decided to switch the Insoles and upon doing so I found a dead creature under the sole. These are Fresh out of the bag so they were delivered that way. Check under your sole!,1,0,28
"So the shoes are stylish light weight but for some reason the front of the shoe you can feel these pressure points that hurt after walking around for a bit. At first I thought they were designed like that and I just needed to wear them in a little but after a few days my feet hurt from them.

If you buy these shoes get some insoles you will thank me",2,0,28
"this shoes is a very good light shoes it was my mistake to buy it big thinking it would fit right, it fits comfortable, good for running once you have the right size, on grass on pavement, in dirt, its so comfortable I only remember its big when I make a sudden turn again its an amazing shoe, foot support well locked in altho its big again that was my fault if you normally wear a 9 I would recommend a half size smaller for the perfect fit, it might work for some but its a very good shoe for the price",5,1,28
Bought these for work as bartender. On my feet all night and dress code requires black shoes. Was trying to keep expenses down and bought this off brand. Very low quality. They cut into the tops of my feet and have very little flex. Couldn‚Äôt wait to take them off at end of night. Returning and buying Nikes. The extra $20 will be well spent.,2,0,28
"This is definitely a fashion sneaker not a workout sneaker. The sneaker has a very stiff sole and the shoe insert is thin with no comfortable cushioning and/or support. The pair I received was NOT NEW as I expected and paid for!!! The insert was used and stained so I removed them and replaced them with new Dr. Scholl's Heavy Duty Inserts. Also, the bottom of the sneaker had asphalt tar spots from prior use. If it was not for the ""green color"" I would have returned them for a full refund but, I decided to clean them up and make them work.",3,0,28
Have had these for about a month and so far they are decent the only problem with them is that you need to be careful when driving. As part of the design for the shoes there are large holes in the bottom of the show big enough to catch the corner of the brake or gas peddles while driving causing you to not be as fast as necessary when hitting the brakes.,3,0,28
"Beautiful style, love the look, light weight but extremely uncomfortable needed to add gel insoles, felt like walking on concrete.",2,0,28
"These sneakers look good, very eye cathing but not really built for working out or even running. The sole of the sneaker is made of hard plastic so it's not flexible. The shoe tread is a very thin piece of rubber. That's gonna wear out soon enough if you wear it often. The insole is also very thin. I had to buy comfort insole to get these sneakers to work for me. Again, they are better for show, not for working out.",4,1,28
"I like the color and design, light weight. What I don‚Äôt like is insole has no cushioning. It will not be great for a long time walking. The quality looks suspicious so I m not sure if this sneakers will last the same as a brand ones. I don‚Äôt think that you can wash then in washing machine since it looks like they a glued.",4,1,28
Love the shoe... Have several colors of the same... However this blue is more of an Aqua color than actual light blue... I really wanted the light blue to match my scrubs but this shade is off by a bit... Looks exactly right in the photo though but was not what I expected regarding the shade of blue when it arrived... No big deal.. I'll make it work...,4,1,28
The shoes fit true to size and look just like the product photos. I purchased these for my father and so far he says they are comfortable and lightweight. He prefers wearing them with thin socks over thicker socks. He‚Äôs debating purchasing another pair in a different color because of the reasonable price and additional coupon.,5,1,28
"Shoe looks good and I get compliments on that. I wear a 12 mens and these are true to size. Only issue is insole isnt as padded as I would like, but more padded than Chucks and other shoes I've tried, but at this price, I can't complain. Wore them on a mountain trail this week and they performed great.",4,1,28
"Thought these sneakers would be light weight but there actually pretty heavy. The way its designed, theres a hard part that presses into the ball under your big toe. Also, don‚Äôt drive a car with these on, with soles hollowed out in the center, they get caught on the pedals! Very dangerous. Good concept, poor design!",1,0,28
"Very unstable shoe cheaply made typical China product, easy to roll in ankle mostly because your foot slides off the soul and starts to twist in process",1,0,28
Shouldn't have expected much from an off brand. My 16 year old son wanted these for track because they matched uniform colors and he thought they looked cool. They do look cool but they have to be the most uncomfortable sneaker I've ever worn (I tried them on as well). These will most likely sit in a closest until we sell them at a yardsale or donate them. Don't waste your money unless you don't need support or you have stones for feet.,1,0,28
"These fit as expected and look cool. Otherwise, don't buy them if you're off average size. I'm 6' 2"" 230 pounds and these shoes were awful from the moment I put them on. I wore them in the gym and can literally feel every bump in the spring sole. I tried putting an extra one in them, nope. Sent back and got a refund.",1,0,28
"Original: I got them in last night. They don‚Äôt come in a box, but they come in a bag. They look nice and sturdy. I have a workout class this evening that I‚Äôll use them in! Will update after usage!

Update: great shoes, got so many compliments the first day I wore them. They have great insoles and don‚Äôt slip and slide like my cheaper ones. Definitely a go to for future wear! I love them.",5,1,28
I bought these for my husband to work out and use to go out casual. They look very stylish. He gets a lot of compliments. I don‚Äôt hear any complaints from him so I think they‚Äôre comfortable. I‚Äôve already washed in the washing machine gentle cold and air dry. Washed well and holding up,5,1,28
"I think that they are unique, and I get a lot of compliments on them. I don't think that they are comfortable to do much but to walk in then on flat surfaces. I hate that the insole comes out when you take them off because they are not secured to the shoe.",4,1,28
I purchased these shoes for working out at the gym. They look great and are light weight but the sculped soles do not flex much and there is not enough padding under the ball of the foot. I am currently trying some pads I got at the local store. Not too bad for an hour workout but I would not want to wear them all day unless the pads I just got work out.,3,0,28
These shoes are generic with no labels. The fire design saves them from looking too fake. I wear a size 9 in women‚Äôs sneakers and ordered a 7 in these (men‚Äôs). Should‚Äôve ordered a 7.5 or 8‚Ä¶.since my toe touches the inside edge and after standing for an hour‚Ä¶.my feet were tired and a toes a tad bruised.,4,1,28
"These are not light weight, they are very heavy compared to my other shoes. 13.4 oz.. each. I have shoes half that weight.",1,0,28
"Well my kids said they look ""dorky"" but I liked the color and I'm significantly cooler than my teenagers. I had to return the shoe because they felt weird. Imaging gluing pencils spaced 1 inch apart to the bottom of your feet. They stomp as hard as you can on sand. Now you know how these shoes felt. If you can't visualize that then........",1,0,28
range! An amazing pair of sneakers! They fit like a glove and are very lightweight and comfortable. I was not expecting this kind of shoe on this price range. I use them for the gym . The soles hold up so well. Very study and again lightweight. I would pay twice for these puppies,5,1,28
"I got to tell you. I got these sneakers today, and was concerned about how they would fit, since I did not try them on. These sneakers felt so good. I wore them today just to break them in, but once I put them on, I was truly amazed on how comfortable they fit. For a unknown brand name, I rate these sneakers up there with my K-Swiss, Puma and Reebox as far as comfort. I would definitely recommend these sneakers. Great looking walking sneakers and considering purchasing another pair in the near future.",5,1,28
"The first thing I noticed is that the shoe was too small. I ordered size 11.5, But I don't know if that's what I got because there's no size anywhere on the shoe (picture) or the bag or label. When I put it next to a size 11 they were exactly the same size (picture). Returning.",2,0,28
"I run early in the morning so got the bright green highlighter color. Slightly large on my feet, I‚Äôm a 10.5 in most shoes so ordered that size. When they got broke in after a few runs, I would definitely order a half size smaller, personally.

Love the brand, cost, performance. I run about 2-3 miles a day and that‚Äôs all I use them for nothing else.

Will be ordering more colors 100%",5,1,28
Terrible Footwear most uncomfortable thing I‚Äôve had on my feet ever. The ridges on the bottom are hard plastic and they hurt the bottom of your feet.,1,0,28
"My husband chose these..........and he is totally pleased in every respect! They not only look great, but are true to size and very comfortable! He is a walker, and goes five miles per day! Thanks to the designer!",5,1,28
This shoe was ordered per my normal shoe size and it fit perfectly. It fits to a normal width so if you have a wide fit you will most likely find it quite snug. The shoe is comfortable for fast walking as I am not a runner. Color is true to the picture of what I ordered.,4,1,28
"This is a followup review. Received in late March 2021. i jog about 15 mikes/week at a moderate pace. Thet are well fitting and comfortable, but not durable (see photos). About 8 weeks in, the rear heel binding wore away causing blisters. First the right then, about 2 weeks later, the left. No longer usable. I guess you get what you pay for.",2,0,28
They have finally arrived love em colors is just as expected UPDATE shoes are kinda tight in middle maybe gotta break them in first we shall see but still love the color UPDATE got a red pair in mail today love em,5,1,28
"I Used this product in the gym for about 5 hours a week...

First week it felt great
Second week it felt great
Got dirty and washed it down on the weekend
Third week it felt good
Fourth week it was totally out of shape, the bottom of the shoe was just feeling funny, I put in different Ingersolls but that did not help.
Now it's just a pair of no good shoes ready for the dump....",2,0,28
The shoes are light and comfortable to stand. However the insoles and comfort during the walking and working out is not good. The feel on the bottom of the feet primarily towards the front is uncomfortable. I can feel the grid on my toes and front of foot.,3,0,28
pretty color but shoe comes apart in the first week of wear,1,0,28
"Like the color, the shoe feels light, but durable. There is a point under the front of the foot towards the inside that acts as a pressure point if your weight is not positioned correctly, but easy to adjust. Has nice grip and feels snug when laced up!

Update : after about a month of light wearing, the stitching on the tongue separated and can now see the insides.",4,1,28
This is the 2nd pair of sneakers I have bought from this vendor and they are some of the MOST comfortable shoes I‚Äòve ever worn. They are also very fashionable. I get several compliments every time I wear them .,5,1,28
"I ordered these since I was hoping they would match my work safety vest. It's a perfect match! I get tons of positive compliments on them.
The fit is a little small, so I recommend ordering 1 size larger.",5,1,28
This is shoes are really good for the price I was pleasantly surprised the look is eye grabbing come off as wear high end shoes for a fraction of the cost will definitely buy again and very comfortable good fit also,5,1,28
"I've only worn the shoes twice , but so far so good , I'm limited at this point , but in a few days will be able to give them a good work out and will know better how well they protect my feet They are indeed comfortable thus far .",4,1,28
"this shoes area no no if your just doing casual walking your gonna need to put in an extra insole if not you gonna feel the riddled design when walking. 2) they are so heavy there is no way its a running shoes, i gave it a 2 for the design.",2,0,28
"Superior design running shoes....impact absorbing soles, premium stretch laces, breathable uppers, light weight, built in arch and metarsil support, beautiful color design and a great value",5,1,28
I have other sport shoes that are lighter than these. These are lightweight but the soles make them slightly heaver than the others. No problem as the soles provide firm support.,5,1,28
"The only good thing about the shoes was the ‚Äúlooks‚Äù.
Awful shoes",1,0,28
"Best fit I have ever had. I have a hard time walking and I get more balance support with these on. If you are a half size, size up. I usually wear men's 12WW and the 13 were perfect!",5,1,28
Love the color of these shoes. So far they seem comfortable(only had for 3 days so far) Only complaint is some of the shoe seems to be made of hard plastic instead of rubber (especially around the soles). Plan on buying another pair because it's hard to find other brands with this much color,4,1,28
"My husband bought a pair months ago and I absolutely fell in love with the color. Bought a uniform to match them before I even ordered mine!!
Affordable and stylish!!!",5,1,28
The product is a it tight at the beginning but as it works to the shape of your feet it turns into confort and excellent grip for quick movement. Light weight and absorption of concrete floor. Excellent for any court.,5,1,28
"These shoes look awesome, but they are terrible. Wore them a few times hoping they would get better but it feels like you are walking in rocks barefoot. Only gave one star because that is the lowest it would let me.",1,0,28
"Well, I was a little skeptic to purchase this shoes just as you, but I was in for a surprise. There is not a single thing I can say is wrong with these beauties. It‚Äôs stylish it‚Äôs comfortable it‚Äôs attractive. Just a white tee with a denim wear these and you will feel so confident. If you are still thinking hey just go for it.",5,1,28
I like these shoes a lot. The color combo of forest green and yellow looks great with my school colors for baseball uniform. Very happy with purchase. They are pretty comfortable also.,5,1,28
Yes indeed yesss indeed love the comfort of these shoes. Very beautiful color. Received lots of compliments. Yes I will be purchasing more colors. Thanks Amazon,5,1,28
"Ordered twice, unfortunately, both are wrong with sizes, you have to read carefully, each model has a different size.
Other than feels good and looks really stylish.",5,1,28
Look good felt ok until worn a few days. Hard plastic bottom and very thin rubber wore out exsposing said hard plastic. Save your money buy better,1,0,28
looks good and light weight but sole too hard,1,0,28
This shoe is super cool! I am a girl so I order the appropriate small size. Only problem is it sits high on the ankle and hits the front left and right parts of my ankle bone. Unfortunately I will have to return this shoe. I ordered one in blue for my boyfriend. I will see how it fits his foot since this is a man‚Äôs shoe maybe it will fit him better,3,0,28
I guess you get what you pay for. They have a very weird fit. They aren't wide but have a ton of space on the top of the shoe. The size as far as length is good and fits as expected. But the upper area around the laces has way too much space to make use as an athletic shoes for my foot anyways. But for the money they are decent shoes for every day use. Can't say I wouldn't buy another pair for that use.,3,0,28
"I'm very surprised by them, they are extremely comfortable inside, and look amazing on the outside. Definitely one of the best shoes at this price.",5,1,28
Great fit. I gave it 4 stars because it's not as comfortable as I would like. Don't get me wrong they are comfortable. Just not as comfortable as I would like. Still a great shoe with comfort and fit.,4,1,28
"These shoes are killing my husband's feet. The insole is rubbing the bottom of his foot, so we got new insoles. It helped however overall the shoe isn't great but ok.",1,0,28
These shoes are so lightweight and comfortable. The size I order is very accurate. True to size. These will be my go to shoes now. Love the vibrant range of colors they come in. Tiamou if you're reading this you guys should make me your product promoter. I could really get these out there. Oh yeah and can you go up some on the women sizes because I where a 12 in women's and they have some of the best colors.,5,1,28
"I‚Äôve been searching for a a show that works good with my orthotics and helps with my toe pain, these are the best shoes I‚Äôve found so far, very comfortable!!",5,1,28
I love the way they look and how comfortable they are. I did purchase half a size larger since they didn't come in 7.5. Not a fan of the shoe lace though,4,1,28
"Exactly what you would expect for a cheap shoe-the in sole padding is thick in places and thin in others and you can really feel it in your feet, build quality is bad but not great-great for just kick around shoes pop em on go to the store sorta thing.",4,1,28
My husband has only worn these new shoes a handful of times and the heel is already worn through especially on the left shoe. Cheap rubber on the sole. I dont see these lasting very long. Very disappointed.,1,0,28
"They do look as good in person as on the webpage. Only had these for a week so can‚Äôt speak of longevity, but they are comfortable for wearing around the house and exercise bike. Weather has been too bad to try outside at this point.",4,1,28
I tell you what comfortability and look I would take these over a 200$ paid of nikes any day. I have like 3 pairs of these types of shoes off Amazon and I tell you they look great and last long. For the price you can‚Äôt go wrong and these blue ones no one has ever seen I get compliments all the time. You can buy 4 of these vs 1 Nike that feel like crap and arnt anywhere near as comfy. Just my two cents,5,1,28
I bought these shoes to match the colors with a few of my work shirts. I was pleasantly surprised with the look and the comfort for the price. These were really affordable for ~$38.00 way cheaper than the name brands. I bought a second pair of the blue ones! Would recommend for anyone.,5,1,28
"A total waste of money, purchased two different styles and immediately returned them ,made completely out of a type of plastic , even the sole , very dangerous on wet floors , this shoe needs to be removed.",1,0,28
Fit great. Looks like a very expensive pair of shoes. I'm 73 and within two day I had four comments and questions; where did you get those?,5,1,28
"Fit is ok, and they look great.
insole pattern is uncomfortable so I added new insoles, still uncomfortable.
Sole is extremely rigid and shoe is heavy.
I walk 2-3 miles per day and try as I might I just can‚Äôt wear them.
I regret buying these shoes.",1,0,28
"I liked the looks of these. Were comfortable for the first week. I only had these for a month when they started coming apart, glue not strong enough. I bought 2 pairs, 1 for work and 1 for non work. Both pairs did not last. You don't want to step in dog/cat poop or anything else for that matter, it'll go thru all the spaces and it's a pain to get it cleaned out. I won't be buying these again.",2,0,28
"I like the look of the shoes and my husband said they felt good when he first tried them on. He got them for work, he is a mechanic and he wanted them to match his vest. The soles wore out quickly, so don‚Äôt think they are good for if u walk a lot or run a lot. But they are some nice looking shoes. I wudnt recommend buying for running unless u don‚Äôt run a lot.",3,0,28
"These are great shoes. Got white, and wishing they didn't get so dirty so fast, but other than that they're wonderful shoes. Probably going to get another pair in a different color ‚Äì I've had the white and red ones for about a month and they're seriously great. And for the price? Excellent.",5,1,28
"These shoes are not comfortable and have caused so much pain and discomfort. I walk about 10-11 miles every day. The first couple days the shoes were okay, I interpreted the discomfort as part of breaking them in. However, now this has transformed to pain around my heels that is unbearable. The shoes have no real shock absorption so your heels take it all. Don‚Äôt get these shoes.",1,0,28
Just received them today. Fits nice. So far comfortable to walk around in. Very lite weight. Hopefully durable. I'll order another pair soon. Great selection of colors.,5,1,28
They were comfy and supportive but two months later they are falling apart. I walk on laminate and pavement daily. I'm so bummed.,3,0,28

"Whoever said these shoes are comfortable, are crazy and out of their mind! The bottom looks like it would be absorbing the impact as you walk or run, but there is zero absorption! ZERO!! Honestly‚Ä¶. They are so bad, I wouldn‚Äôt give them to a homeless man! Better yet, I wouldn‚Äôt give them to Fred Flintstone, and he pushed his car barefoot!
Do not buy these, my feet still hurts!",1,0,28
Great shoe...but wish they made sizes in Narrow. Enough cushion and reaction to include an array of colors to choose from.,5,1,28
"They were good until after running with them only about 5 times, the part of the shoe wear your heel is got ripped and now wearing them gives my heel a blister because these shoes are very cheaply made",1,0,28
"As the moment I was putting on this shoe for the first time, I felt the sole was very hard. It felt like I was wearing a brick on my feet. I took this off immediately and then I took it to my UPS store to return it. Please don‚Äôt buy these shoes unless you want your feet hurt.",1,0,28
I really like the high arch supports and light weight in these shoes liked it so much I bought myself a second pair and bought my wife a pair,5,1,28

( 30 Y/O Male - 6‚Äô3 - 298 lbs - Size 13 shoe..). I went to the track to put these babies to the test! I walked 3 laps and ran 1- And WELP! no foot fatigue, they‚Äôre light, good stability, with good traction and looks GREAT IN PERSON...üòúüòú EVERYONE ARE ASKING ME ARE THEY NIKES AND ETC..!- But NOPE! Also, when wearing the shoe while running and walking, I didn‚Äôt get any uncomfortable sole or metatarsal pressure points that would cause discomfort. (I‚Äôm flat footed by the way), So it was a really good perk to me! NEVERTHELESS, I‚Äôm getting the Neon Green ones Next week and FAST SHIPPING also!- (UPSTATE SOUTH CAROLINA).. JUST GO AHEAD AND ORDER EVERY COLOR THEY HAVE ü§£ü§£ü§£üí™üèΩüí™üèΩüèÉüèæüèÉüèæüèÉüèæ",5,1,28
"I thought a shoe with writing on the side look kindof cool. I laughed my butt off upon opening the shoe box. It says ‚Äújust so-so‚Äù on the shoe. Well that accurately describes this purchase. Although modern looking, this shoe is incredibly cheap. First, the sole feels like you‚Äôre pushing down on concrete. There‚Äôs no comfort to the shoe whatsoever. Second, the heel support flexes down and back so it feels like you‚Äôre sinking into the back of the shoe. You can feel the base through the sole which lead to blisters on my feet. Also, after two days of wearing I noticed the Shoes started making farting sounds from the heel area. So over all I‚Äôd say this shoe is ‚Äúso-so‚Äù at best if best is described as an uncomfortable feeling and flatulent sounding shoe. It‚Äôs an excellent party favor though. When people see the ‚Äújust so-so‚Äù label on the side of the shoe laughter ensues. This causes me to think. What if every company started creating slogans that accurately depicted the quality of their products?",1,0,28
 I like these sneakers definitely recomended. Material feels great definitely has gd traction for jogging walk at the park and the web bottom will hold on definitely. Made very well,5,1,28
Is so perfect !! My favorite snickers for Gym !! 100% very good!!!,5,1,28
"Hallo to my fellow friends, this product is a scum period. It‚Äôs just for looks but it‚Äôs worthlessness. I received it 3 days ago, I tried it and it‚Äôs not what I expected. The looks of the shoes are eye catcher but they weigh like a 10 lbs on the feet‚Äôs. To make story short, it‚Äôs a deceiving fake product, they are very heavy. I urge you to stay away from it.
Lastly, I asked if I could return it but I haven‚Äôt heard from them, now I‚Äôm stuck with it.
It‚Äôs going in a trash.",1,0,28
"Omg omg this shoe are too lit. I don't care if they aren't name brand,they look it and are very comfortable on even tho they are for my daughter. I wear a size 8.5 in women,so i got a 7 and just ordered the red ones for myself. They also look just like the picture.",5,1,28
"Where do I begin with these ‚Äúshoes‚Äù? You know those wooden shoes the Dutch wear/wore? I would workout in them for a week before I workout in these bad boys again. Not sure if you can tell from the pics, but the shoes actually have written across both sides ‚ÄúJust So So‚Äù. I only wish ‚Äúso-so‚Äù were true. There is nothing stylish, comfortable, or even wearable about these things. I‚Äôm pretty sure they are 3-D printed out of completely, non-flexible polypropylene. The ‚ÄúJust So So‚Äù was hilarious. Other than that I wouldn‚Äôt wear these shoes again if they were covered in silk, memory foam and velvet.",1,0,28
This product fits a little snug because of all of the support that‚Äôs inside. I have very high arches so the cushioning inside the sneaker is very supportive and comfortable. If you wear a size 9 or a size 8 1/2. I‚Äôm sure I will order a similar sneaker again. This week will be specifically for fashion purposes only. Over I am satisfied with this product,5,1,28
"My husband love these tennis shoes. I bought them for him for Christmas. These shoes are stylish and look very nice with his jeans and sport clothes. He said that these shoes are so light that it feels as though that he is walking on air. Although these shoes are light, these shoes gives his feet a lot of support. I highly recommend these tennis shoes.",5,1,28
"These, for the price are excellent shoes.

I‚Äôve asked a couple of people how much they thought it cost and they said 130!

The price is right, size is accurate, plenty of room for thick socks and wide feet. Gives me extra reach on my pedal and quite comfortable to drive in.

5 stars, the only thing i didn‚Äôt like was the long floppy laces but still a good buy.",5,1,28
"Part of the tread on the sole is starting to unglue and separate after just one month of gym use. Mostly weights and a little walking on treadmill, so not even long term running. Hardly ever wear the shoes outside of the gym, other that to walk through the parking lot. Just makes you wonder how quickly they would fall apart with actual running on concrete or pavement. Not worth the price for the hassle of starting to fall apart after such a short time, spend double your money on a name brand shoe.",1,0,28
"I got caught up in the ""must try"" trend on these and tried them for the first time today.

Let me just start by saying I'm athletic and over the years, (I won't say how many, but it is more than three decades), I have worn most of the brands of shoes by trial and error in training, races, and for every day gym use. I go through a new pair of running shoes every two months or so because they get miled out. I consistently use about three major brands and need stability due to overpronation.

These on first try on were stiff in the soles but a little flexible in the lacings. They stayed stiff in the soles through their first workout. They give back ZERO when you're wearing them. There is no foam or gel in there anywhere-just an insole to keep you from jarring on the crinkly hard plastic sole. They have some flex in the midfoot but as soon as they flex, those hard plastic wings on the side that hold the last lace hole will jab you in the ankle. The lace holding wings anchor the laces, which is good because the rest of the lacing is just through sewn to the top loops that aren't lined up very well to give you a custom fit when you try to cinch them or move them around. The lacing also seems too high on the foot, it starts midfoot instead of lower above the toes. Lastly, the shoes give a really hard ride and even walking will make you wonder if you have shin splints. I also have the suspicion that for my pair at least, the left shoe is different in construction than the right...something feels off. Production quality is definitely as lacking as the tech in these babies.

All in all, I hate to be less than positive, but these shoes are really just for looks. I love the colors and the SO SO tape on them, they're like if Ikea made running shoes, this would be them. They look like a running shoe, cost a small penny, and ultimately they do go on your feet. I guess I'd keep them in the bugout bag just in case, but I sure wouldn't run or workout in them. I gave them two stars for style & color.",2,0,28
"Minus 2 Stars. To be fair, I didn't expect much and they were cheap so I decided to give them a try. Plus, most Amazon recommendations are not complete garbage; these shoes are. The fit is way off. I wear a 9-1/2. These are 10 and my toes were cramped due to the poor design. They are very difficult to get on (I'll skip the details). Most of all, the cushioning you expect from the perforated soles is non-existent. They're like wearing a couple of bricks. Maybe the worst thing I've ever bought. Junk. Junk, junk, junk. Returned with a vengeance.",1,0,28
"I have seen these on here for months and finally decided to give them a shot, and honestly, im kicking myself for not buying them sooner. I work as a massage therapist and I'm on my feet for 6-8 hours a day. So I need good shoes. A few months ago I got a pair of New Balance and for me they were terrible. Mushy soles with no support. I followed those with the exact opposite and got a pair of Hoka shoes. Very supportive, but it looks like I stole them from my grandpa. These shoes are a perfect mix. The molded plastic bottoms provides a much better standing surface, and these look amazing in person. Very good build quality for the price. I would say like just a small notch below Nikes and Addidas. I had a couple strings that needed snipped back but nothing major. For the price you won't beat these. If you have kids that want the 200+ yeezys or something, these are a great alternative on a budget. Plus the ""just so so"" is absolutely hilarious lol Anyways I hope this helps someone",5,1,28
"On the plus side these shoes are pretty light & the top material feels breathable.

Unless you are walking on the backs of the heals, these have 0, nodda, no cushion, so if you are walking on concrete you feel like you are barefoot on concrete. Scratch that, in bare feet on flat concrete you don't have any pressure points against the sides of your feet causing them to go numb after less then a mile of walking. These are now on their way back after maybe an hour of use.",1,0,28
"When I first got the shoes I was super excited about them, reading all the videos I had high high hopes. Aesthetically. They are gorgeous but when trying to work out in them they aren't functional. I walk everyday anywhere from 3 to 5 miles daily, uphill. When first trying them on they were super small, I got a mens size 8 (I wear women's 10) but easily loosened up after my first trial walk of 1.5 miles. I took them out the next day 3 miles and at first they were comfortable I was able to do my first mile in 19 mins (usually takes me 21 mins in my old shoes) thats when I noticed the burning in my backs of my heel(s), when I got home I took off my shoes and socks to examine my heels they were a little raw but no skin broken.

I took them out today for my usual 5 miles and I couldn't get half way on my usual routine when I started noticing blood coming my sock. These shoes have something metal in the back of the shoes that pierce the heel, I can feel my heels rubbing up against it as I walk. I really had a lot of hope with these shoes but I am having to return them. I'll just upfront the money I was going to pay for a better pair.",2,0,28
"I‚Äôm not a fan - my wife has a pair and loves them, so I bought a pair to try.

I like the quirky style - the shoes look exactly like they do in the photo. The fabric is reasonably comfortable and I think it will wear well (durable). On a different sole, I think the shoe would be comfortable.

So, that‚Äôs it - I don‚Äôt like the soles. They look ok, however, they feel like plastic. I‚Äôm heavy and the shoes don‚Äôt offer much support (they don‚Äôt give at all, they feel like I‚Äôm wearing wooden clogs).

For working out, I normally wear running shoes. I used to wear five fingers - I haven‚Äôt found them where I live, so I‚Äôve had to look at other options. If you‚Äôre not familiar with 5-fingers, they are essentially gloves for your feet and offer no support. Even so, they are more comfortable than the ‚Äújust so so‚Äù brand (from my perspective).... (I offer the 5-finger perspective to explain that I‚Äôve happily worn shoes with ‚Äúno support‚Äù and I‚Äôd rather work out barefooted than work out in these ‚Äújust so so‚Äù shoes.)

To be clear, I am not endorsing the five finger brand, nor am I encouraging you to buy some other shoe - I‚Äôm just providing a reference.

Anyway - I like the uniqueness of the shoe and would recommend them if they were more comfortable. For me, the sole is too rigid so the support isn‚Äôt there for me.

I gave 2-stars because my wife loves them (5-stars from her) and I‚Äôm not a fan.... even so, if you buy them, I hope you like them.",2,0,28
"So after opening the box, the shoe looks great and looks exactly like the picture. My first concern was that they wouldn't fit well cause I didn't try them on in the store, but they fit perfectly, I was pretty shocked. So, so far the shoe looks exactly like the picture and fits great, even better than shoes I've bought in the past.

When you first put the shoe on there is a weird feeling, cause it has an unusual insert, I almost thought there was some paper still in the shoe at first, but after a while, you get used to it and it is no longer a bother. The bottom of this shoe is like some kind of plastic, and this is where the real problem with the shoe comes, when I walk or run in this shoe, the heel of my foot smashes into this plastic at full force and you can really feel it, after just one 2 mile run, I made it about half a mile before switching back to my old shoes. The shoes were super affordable, so I might try a custom insert, but honestly, the shoe fits so perfectly IDK if a thicker insert will fit. If you can find a way for the heel to get a bit more protection this could be a great shoe for the price, as it stands I would not recommend running in, and even walking in I can still feel my heel hitting really hard.",3,0,28
"These shoes are so comfortable! I‚Äôm very surprised with the quality of these shoes, considering where they are made (hint: definitely not in the States, as it says ‚ÄúJust So So‚Äù and other random sayings around the shoe). The insert is pretty cushioned, and they don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre too hard on the bottoms when walking. However, I would not recommend running or working out in these since they don‚Äôt offer the support for that - these are strictly for fashion and basic walking around.

I got these men‚Äôs shoes because they don‚Äôt have my size in women‚Äôs, so if you‚Äôre a gal, just know they‚Äôre a little clunky! If that doesn‚Äôt bother you, then you‚Äôre golden. I wear these with ankle skinny jeans and a basic t-shirt or hoodie and I feel like I‚Äôm back in the L.A. homeland already.

They also have this awesome neon color that can double as an aircraft marshalls‚Äô guide on flight lines ;) anyway, these are a great buy if you want street fashion, but don‚Äôt want to pay the Yeezy price tag to get it. I totally expect to get them in at least one or two more colors!",5,1,28
These are some great shoes to wear walking or shopping. They are stylish and will definitely get you looks if you re looking something out of the ordinary. The lime green and orange ones are great for safety when walking the roads during low visibility hours. They come in a variety of colors to go with anything in your casual wardrobe as well and are definitely attention getters. The key to buying these is to look for the ones with the cuts near the front. Those are the true walking/shopping shoes which have the flexibility needed for comfort. There are multiple sellers of these on here and other sites and some sell the flat bottom versions which are fine for just wearing out but (BEWARE) that they don't give good traction on wet surfaces!! If you don't like them you can always sit on them and sell them later as the prices go up or just collect them because they re cute!! :-),5,1,28
"If you're like me and ONLY buy after reading great reviews about a product, then read my review and simply press the buy button! (I buy from Amazon at least once a week!) Honestly, this product was just as described and very cute packaging. It shipped really fast too. I look for quality when buying anything and this met my standards 100%. I'm not too big on writing reviews all the time but I took the time out to do so because I'm very please with this purchase. I would definitely buy again!",5,1,28
"Had the shoes for about a week now.
Looking at the pics on Amazon for the shoe, I was under the assumption that with the lattice design of the sole, that these shoes would be very 'cushy' and springy to wear. That's not the case (hence the 4-star rating), but not bad overall.

PROS:
- Fit is true. They do run a bit longer in the toes, but not overly long.
- Tongues are sewn to the sides of the uppers, so they are fixed in place and won't slide to the side as you walk. I REALLY like this feature, because I'm always adjusting the tongues in my other shoes during the day.
- They are fairly comfortable to walk in all day. even though they aren't as cushy/springy as I was hoping for. To me, it almost feels like I'm walking in bare feet. At the end of the day, my feet don't feel as sore as with my other shoes, so I'm pleasantly surprised by that result !
- The large loops at the back of the shoe are REALLY helpful in getting them on. I've had no problems with them getting in the way of walking / driving, etc. at all.
- So far no issues with the glue on the soles coming apart. Will update this review if that changes.

CONS:
- Fit is a bit snug. If you need a wide shoe, you may want to jump to the next size to see if that helps.
- (and this is a minor ""Con"") - they do make a slight squeaky noise when you walk in them. Not overly loud, but somewhat noticeable.
- I wouldn't recommend them for Running. Definitely more of a walking shoe.

Overall I would rate these as AVERAGE. I paid $46 for these and don't feel they are worth any more than that.

[08/26/2021 Update]: Have been wearing these now everyday this month, and I don't have any discomfort at the end of the day like I do with my other shoes (even those with my Orthotic inserts in them!) The feel to me, like I stated previously feels like walking barefoot - which I THOUGHT would be a huge problem for me - turns out it seems to be just what I needed.

The sole on the right shoe is starting to peel away from the toe (slightly), but other than that I have no issues with these shoes so far.",4,1,28
"Here is another import cheaper style shoe that you can actually work out in. I still wouldn't recommend that you work out with them, but you can as they might not last long. Comfort is an A+. Style is an A++. Support is a high B+. I was shocked at their comfort. The cushioned removeable soul is soft and the innards of the shoe fit like a pillow puff. The shoe is solid and flexible at the same time. I put prosthetics in them and they tolerated them with no problems and gave me that extra arch support my feet require. The hard rubber is both soft and supportive. They are a bit long in the front, but you should have no problems ordering the right size for your foot. These shoes are slip-ons and will eventually have slip on problems due to stretching. I have the blue and green and I also bought the green and yellow. The shoes breath like a healthy nose and the fleecing cools your feet and dries water pretty fast. I was really shocked at the style and performance for the price. Delivery was acceptable with no problems. I also purchased a pink white version as a gift and....wow! Is all I can say. The hard rubber soul is built to last, but the rubber tread underneath is not going to last very long. I will consider more purchases for the future. I use these shoes after I use my serious trainers and get cleaned up to hit the town. This shoe is huge on style and they are very bright in any color. Their performance seems to be hidden in the style, but the performance is there. These shoes should cost double or more then what they are asking.",5,1,28
"I would not recommend these shoes for anyone who‚Äôs trying to exercise or put a lot of miles into them. I just returned mine because the tread on the bottom was starting to peel off after 2 weeks of having them. They‚Äôre also really snug so if you were to buy them, I‚Äôd get a size larger than usual.",1,0,28
"Well.... at least this part isn't limited like the seller feedback. I ordered these shoes on July 31st 2020. They arrived 5 days later (today) on Aug 5th. Not too awful bad of a wait for the so called amazing Prime Shipping. I have probably close to 50 pair of shoes from boots to sandals to Vibram toe shoes. Everyone single one of them is size 12! 40 years old, I've had the same shoe size for more than 20 years now. Sometimes shoes fit differently based on how they are made and the company that makes them, I get that. However, these arrive in a clear plastic bag wadded up and placed loosely in am Amazon box. Immediately when I pulled them out I knew they couldn't be a size 12 because I thought I was going to need a forklift to pick them up. I take them out and hold them up to the size 12 Reebok that were currently on my feet. Yeah, I don't think so!! HAHA So I put one on. My toes barely came to the bottom of the laces!! They didn't even go into the toe section of the shoe! I couldn't help but have one of those dumb WTF looks on my face! The side of the shoe say ""(Something) SO SO (Something)"". That's as far as I'd go with describing these shoes, SO SO!! I mean the fabric appears to be made of whatever that is in the corner of your mouth when you wake up in the morning. I order a size 12 and got sent two boats made from belly button lent. I look under the tongue to see what size they actually sent me. There is NOTHING but a little tiny 1/4 inch tag that says 2048 on one side and 46 on the other. Besides that, there is NOTHING on these shoes to tell you a size, what it's made of, where it came from (even though the plastic bag is plastered with ""MADE IN CHINA"") I mean NOTHING on these shoes!! I'm going to recommend NOT buying these shoes! They were literally in my possession for 30mins before I printed off a label and made my way to Kohls to return them. I did actually consider keeping them though. We are going on a Scuba diving trip this September and I could always use a pair of flippers!! In all honesty, for almost $50 you'd be better off just buying a pair of socks instead of these shoes. They will protect your feet for a short amount of time on hot pavement and that's about it. So for a lot less you could just get a pair of socks!

Not happy with Amazon's listing of these because the sizes are WAY OFF!! They are junk material and the process from purchase to returning them through Amazon before you get any money back needs MAJOR WORK!!

Oh and I gave a 2 star rating because lets be honest, no one needs a 1 star.",2,0,28
" Overall, I love these shoes for my everyday work needs. I experience no foot or knee pain at the end of my day. I, highly, recommend that you give them a try and see if they work for you. I've purchased three pairs in different colors from the same company and they all fit differently. The black with red trim is my favorite because they provide the most room and comfort. The fit is a little bigger in men's sizes and the women's is a bit snug. With the minor size issues I can't say they're true to size, but I've never had to send a pair back either. I suggest full size up on women's, half size down in men's. You can't go wrong for the price and style in multiple colors. The only real annoyance is that you'll be, constantly, telling everybody that these aren't Nikes.",5,1,28
The shoes are nice looking but run larger than expected. I should have exchanged them for a size small but unfortunately I needed them for work ASAP. I have had the shoes now for about two weeks and the soles are coming apart. I walk on finished concrete all day as I work in a retail environment. I don‚Äôt think I would suggest these to others. As a pair of shoes should last Ionger than two weeks.,3,0,28
"The title plus description claims that these shoes can be used for tennis. I decided to buy three pairs because I go through tennis shoes frequently. These shoes should NOT be used to play tennis. The sole design is prone to cause damage to the foot, specifically the ankle and plantar fascia. Beware if you are going to purchase. Also, after two matches the tread of the shoe will be completely worn. Nice looking but will not be usefull for tennis.",1,0,28
I was not a fan of these. Kinda a weird fit like my foot didn‚Äôt feel like it was where it was suppose to go. The show itself is very bulky and not flattering. Not a fan of these. And what is the writing all over suppose to be very confusing.,1,0,28
"Maybe mine were made wrong but I wasn't too pleased. The style itself was nice which is why I purchased initially. However the shoe strings are very basic and there was really no way to tighten and tie them due to how it's made. When I did the elastic part under the shoe string bunched up and made it super uncomfortable. Plus it was a wide show to me. I wear 13's but I had another pair of similar build shoes on, and there was no comparison on how they fit/looked. Realize these are at the bottom of the price spectrum but regardless I wasn't too pleased. Maybe smaller feet they fit better on but for me it just didn't work out I guess but give them a try if u like. They look good in pics and in person but just beware if you have a larger foot.",2,0,28
"I bought two pairs of these sneakers, the red and the black and red. They look great and fit well. They are fine for walking around at my job and in public but not good for running on the treadmill or elliptical work. I use a pair of Asics model 21's for running on equipment and these sneakers do not compare to those Asics. The soles are just too uncomfortable especially in the balls of the feet/fore foot area for running. I honestly use my Vibram 5 finger sneakers for running outside and they are a lot more comfortable than these for that activity. There is just something a little odd or off about the sole and heal shape and padding. They are very good looking fashion sneakers and for 30 - 35 dollars I would buy them again.
The bottom of the sneakers is a hard rubber that gets slippery when it's wet so I have to tread somewhat carefully when walking around and the pavement is wet because they tend to slide. - again for 30- 35 it's a decent fashion sneaker, It's no Asics, it's Just So So... : )",3,0,28
"When I first purchased these sneakers the insoles were flat. Now it has a considerable amount of cushioning that encourages me to repurchase the previous version. These shoesüëü really turns some heads like you wouldn‚Äôt believe. Especially the red ones, I get so many complements from them it‚Äôs overwhelming. I‚Äôm a 49er fan so I wear the red and red/black ones a lot. The new version makes you feel like you are floating on air. And for some reason the seem to be a little bit more roomy. I thought I had every color, but hold on, they have many. I‚Äôm still looking and searching for more beautiful colors. These sneakers üëü are amazing.",5,1,28
"I bought my husband his first pair in May as he wears steal toed leather boots all day at work and needed something that breathed more. They have definitely helped in the breathability part, big bonus on his feet. We have found that because he wears steal toed boots at work he is EXTREMELY hard on his regular shoes so the honeycomb sole does not work well for him and he does have a bit of a penguin walk which makes his feet slide to the inside of his shoes, very hard on the glue to these shoes. I will say this, it will really depend on how you wear out your other shoes as to whether these will work out for you. You still can't beat the price. We've spent A LOT more to have a pair of shoes fall apart in less than a week. My husband needs more of a running shoe that can handle the abuse, he'll just have to start changing his socks before he leaves work. Side note: I have 2 pairs of these shoes. Am a diabetic with special orothotics, have MS, use a walker, cane and leg brace(s) to help walk and I LOVE YHE HELL OUT OF THESE SHOES for many reasons; this why I got hubby to try a pair.",5,1,28
"I bought these for my son as a back up pair of sneakers. Turns out he liked them so much he wears them all the time! And I can‚Äôt believe it but he gets tons of compliments on them! We both think it‚Äôs so funny that the $40 shoes gets so much attention vs his shoes that cost more than double! I want to buy another pair, a different color but the red is so striking! He said they are very comfortable and he loves them and I believe him he is always in them! The photo is him in the space needle so yeah he wears them all the time! Now my daughter wants a pair! I can‚Äôt blame her I do too now.",5,1,28
I was super excited getting these ones as they looked amazing on the photos and had great reviews. I think it‚Äôs hit or miss if you get shoes that actually look like that. Mine were different size even though it said the same. Put them next to each other and it‚Äôs 1/2‚Äù off. One of them also had uneven sole. The back part was much bigger than picture. Super disappointed because I wanted to love them. But just feels like cheap toy shoes. No quality at all. Will try to order a new pair and see if I have better luck since reviews are good.,1,0,28
"Pros...Beautiful design. Sole looks more like a Nike Shox kinda design. Nike uses tough plastic with reinforcement . It will initially give a hardened fell, but will last longer as its prone to more impact. This shoe feels comfortable right out of the box. However since the plastic under the sole is more elastic, over time it gives up. You will find your heel leaning inboard since there is no rigid support. I don't use this for workout. Just regular walking. Had this for about 6 months now..Used it probably less than 5 times per month and its already loosing its support. Spend the $$ and get a better designed and tested product.",3,0,28
"First impressions - I had seen people wearing these and just like everyone else I thought they were Nikes or some other premium brand. I decided to give them a go after reading several reviews from independent websites as well as Amazon feedback. They fit perfectly. I had a wide foot size 12 and ordered a size 12. Some of the reviews said they run a bit big but that is not the case for me.

There is padding under the ball of the foot as well as good arch support. I can see why a benefit of these shoes is plantar fasciitis support.

They move and bend easily and I don't believe any type of break in period will be needed. My primary purpose for buying these was to complete my boxing workouts that consists of shadow boxing, heavy bag work, and a lot of jump rope. With a sturdy build and what seems to be a dependable sole they will hold up for sure.",5,1,28
I ABSOLUTELY Love these shoes! I was iffy before BUT when I tried them on...I loved them UNTIL this sudden white spots kept appearing on the shoe. It is embarrassing bc I have to constantly keep wiping off the top of the shot to remove the white cloudy spots that keep resurfacing.,2,0,28
"I bought these shoes to play tennis in and maybe do some light walking. From the outset when I unpackaged I realized the bottom of the shoes was not like regular and seemed cumbersome.

After trying it on i felt as if I had on a dancing shoes and not a sneakers. Shoes was not soft to the ground as you walked so I was very nervy to play tennis with these. I ventured out to the court for a quick one hour game. The shoes made running to warm up and stretching feel like a lot of work but I figured it‚Äôs a new pair or shoes and different style to get used to. I was feeling pains in my sole as well as shin but decided to play anyway.

The shoes was not comfortable. They felt heavy at times. At other times I could barley move around as the shoes were not soft to the ground so powering off from one position to the next was really hard. I decided that I wouldn‚Äôt change them and play on hoping it would get better. But they just didn‚Äôt feel like tennis shoes or walking shoes or any shoes.

I doubt I‚Äôll play in them again as I am not sure this will be good for an active game as tennis.

I also looked at the bottom of the shoes when I as done just to see if anything was there to cushion my steps and to my surprise after jus an hour of playing the bottom of the shoes had already worn down. So these won‚Äôt be lasting long. Pictures included to show. This was first wear first game less than two hours.

Not pleased.

I didn‚Äôt give it a one star rating since I‚Äôve only worn it once and maybe I‚Äôm not giving it a fair chance. But right now I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll be playing in them again.

Hunt for another tennis shoes continues

Update

Shoes bottom fell off. This is what less than 2 months. Sigh.",2,0,28
"I bought these as they are billed as walking, running, kind of an all around shoe. I have bought Sketchers in the past and really like the fit. I have only had them a couple of days so the jury is out but my first impressions are that they are pretty good.
The fit was reasonable but they do not have a traditional ""tongue"". It is attached all the way up and does not move like most shoes. The laces were way too long so I replaced them with the stretch not tie type which I do for all my shoes. They are comfortable when walking or working out at the gym. They are a little noisy when I walk on the road. I believe it is the sole design that creates this. I will update this in a month.",4,1,28
I bought 2 pairs for my husband who wears a size 13. He could. It get his foot into the opening so I had to return them. I wear an 8 and have 2 pairs love the colors. I had no problem getting my foot into them I do. It find them to be as comfortable as ASICS gel Ventura‚Äôs and I wear sneakers every day if I wear them and entire a day my feet are still sore. They are great for short periods a wear,1,0,28
"These shoes will make you look and feel cool, especially if older.
I'm older but very fit compared to most peoples standards, but don't always like having to buy expensive Nikes to prove that, so these shoes kind of do, do the trick, in that can still look athletic, cool and fit, without spending the high dollars.
These shoes do, however, have a tight fit, so best to maybe order size above actual foot size, but the do have a very snug fit to them.
I ordered the black and white model, and the colors contrast is excellent, very bright, making a statement type of bright, people will look down at your feet, or shoes, when wearing these.
I may order more in the future.

I wear to work, just bought, so as far as durability, can't say yet as only worn twice to work.",4,1,28
"I bought 4 pairs, 2 for myself. I am on my feet all day at work and the are the most uncomfortable shoes on concrete. I bought inserts and they still aren't comfortable enough for work. The soles on them are hard plastic. They also looked worn pretty fast, but that I could live with, but not how horrible they are on my feet.",1,0,28
"I don‚Äôt normally write reviews for any product, but with this shoe I think it‚Äôs a good time to start.

First, disclaimer, I have high arches so buying any athletic shoe comes with risks of discomfort. However, the great news is these shoes do not make my arch ache.

Pros: the shoes look great!!!! I got the teal and was super impressed with the look. The quality you get for an inexpensive shoe is pretty great. They were easy to put on and take off, and the tongue being integrated with the shoe makes the fit pretty perfect to size. I wear between a 12/13 depending on the shoe.

Cons: These bad boys are HEAVY!!! It‚Äôs like having a concrete block on your foot, and for treadmill workouts it‚Äôs not great. Second, the insert of the shoe while comfortable for casual wear, is like a flat pillow under your foot. That‚Äôs when you get to the hard rubber sole that is under the footbed. It‚Äôs not very forgiving. I ran for about four minutes on the treadmill and that‚Äôs when the pain started searing through my feet. I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm a big guy, and weight is likely a contributing factor for this, but I also know walking on concrete for a long time with bare feet is painful too.

All in all, for athletics I would not recommend this shoe if you‚Äôre overweight and heavy footed. However, for the price, you can‚Äôt beat how fresh these kicks look, they are relatively comfortable when wearing them as a casual shoe, and I would recommend them as a part of your outfit for going out. I get compliments every time I wear them out, but not from my feet when working out.",2,0,28
"I love this shoe, for a generic brand it is stylish and very comfortable. The sizes run real big so keep that in mind when ordering. I ordered a 9 and it was more like a 10 1/2 which was fine because my husband loved them as soon as he saw them (I'm gay) and they fit him so I just kept them and reordered an 8 hoping those will fit me.",5,1,28
"First impression, shoes do look nice. Unfortunately that's the only positive thing I can say about this product.

After wearing them for approximately two weeks, light use, basically going to work in my car, changing into my work boots, and then changing back to go home, so maybe 2 to 3 hours a day. Maybe walked a total of 2 to 3 miles in these shoes. Lettering is peeling off. Now looking at them, noticing lots of glue residue near the soles. Yes, this is definitely not a brand name, expensive shoes, but my sketchers that are basically same price, are a quality product.

This is not, nowhere near a quality shoe. I am past the window to return these. Otherwise I would do it in a heartbeat.

Buyers, beware, you know how they say, you get what you pay for... This is not the case. Inferior product. Stay away.",1,0,28
"These shoes are comfortable. I like their rounded toes with very little tapering toward the front and the fact that they are deep enough to hold the 5/8"" of padding I have to wear under one heel to keep my hips level. They keep my feet dry when I walk through wet grass or shallow puddles. The strap and loop at the back enable me to get them on without using a shoe horn as I have to for most shoes. The main deficiency is that the black rubbery stuff on the soles started to come off after fewer that a dozen wearings. That doesn't seem to affect shock absorption or traction, but the holes that are exposed pick up gravel from our driveway. They are fine for walking, but I suspect that if I could run, I would find their shock absorption insufficient. They are also somewhat heavier than most shoes I buy for walking,",4,1,28
"Cheaply made product. Materials are poor. Not going to even try to run in these things. They looked cool so I was interested and purchased them. The feel of the materials are not of quality shoes.

Do yourself a favor and just buy a cheap pair of Brooks or Saucony. There are some runners on Amazon from those brands cheaper in cost compared these shoes.

For an idea of quality, these shoes would be sold at Payless if they were still a thing.",1,0,28
"I like the shoes great style and do work however, I ordered a size 9 to be careful it‚Äôs my combat boot size, my regular shoe size for a different product is 8 1/2 and I should have went 1 full size down to an 8 to get the perfect off road fit only thing that made a difference so I had to godown a star on comfort but for anyone buying them just drop a full size they will be great for off road or trail hoppin good design and comfortable fit would work great at a beach for water play to stay away from the bottom Owees altogether good shoes I‚Äôm going to get another pair and size down 1 size üëç",4,1,28
This shoes is uncomfortable and feels like you have no support or cushion. Tried for tennis as it was rated for tennis use‚Ä¶ felt like lead on my feet and had no shock absorption.

"These were highly recommended by coworkers as an cost effective alternative 2 way more expensive name brands, so gave them a try. Looks good, color variations are gr8 & pretty durable outer shell. Inner soles don't hold up well 2 hard surfaces & break dwn fast, plus the fit a bit too loose, & got worse with wear. Def do not breathe well, made my feet sweat even more than usual & treads made an awkward squeal while walking. Worth a try due to being inexpensive, can buy 3 or 4 pairs compared to 1 name brand pair. Could use improved performance.",3,0,28

"I have to say that I love the design, but sorry to say probably the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned. For about the first hour they felt pretty good. After that, my feet hurt so bad, that it was hard to even walk around in just socks. I tried them again a few days later and had the same result. I even added a pair of insole to the brand new shoes and that didn‚Äôt work either. Maybe just not a good fit for my feet. I was hoping they would work as described with low back pain relief, but they actually made it worse..",1,0,28
"The reviews on these shoes are positive, when I first researched into seeing if these would help with plantar fasciitis. After wearing them for weeks I can honestly say that I‚Äôm very disappointed, they have made zero difference in the way my feet feel. Maybe the first couple of days I noticed a slight difference, however after that disappointment is the only thing I‚Äôve felt along with the continued pain in my feet. If these shoes truly helped those people in the reviews, good for them, my advice.......buyer beware, these maybe not be the shoes your looking for.",1,0,28
"EDIT: Changing ny review to 1 star. I ordered another pair in a different color before I made my first review. After wearing them for 2 DAYS the rubber started to fall off the bottom of the shoe and the writing in the side of my shoe has completely came off. Yes the shoes are comfortable however the smaller details just show they wont last long.

Although I LOVE how comfortable these shoes are, im disappointed in the quality. I ordered these July 2021, started wearing mid August 2021 for a new job. Here we are second week of September 2021 and mesh is coming apart from the rubber. I ONLY use them for work in a clean environment. Never exposed to chemicals or elements. Disappointed.",1,0,28
"I waited about a month to write this review, and I have to say I like them a lot. They are comfortable and great looking. I bought them in Red and as I thought would happen people compliment me on them whenever I wear them. At first people see ‚ÄúJUST‚Äù they assume Nike ... üòÇ My wife also likes they way they look and will be ordering herself a pair, and will be getting another pair for myself it‚Äôs JUST hard to choose another color there are like 14 colors to choose from, but for under $50 they Look Good and Feel Good so I will figure it out. Try em you‚Äôll like em !!
The Name is JUST SO SO but they aren‚Äôt üëçüèª",5,1,28
"Let me start by saying I love how these shoes look. They also seem to be a good quality.

The issue I have is that I wear a 10.5 men's, so I always order a half size up, so I got a size 11. I don't have wide feet and I don't wear wide shoes, but these shoes are so tight around the arches of my feet. On the right foot it feels like something hard and rigid is digging into my skin right under the arch of my foot, and is very tight around this area. I thought maybe it was the soles, so I got some nice Dr. Scholl's ones to try, and I still feel the same hard piece of whatever it is digging through it and into my skin. If I wear it for more than a couple of minutes a blister starts forming.

Sad. Really wanted to like these shoes.",2,0,28
"I bought these for my son. He recently started at Home Depot and is on his feet on concrete, lifting concrete and may other heavy things. I had bought him work boots, and he ended up with tendinitis and was off work for a week on doctor's orders. I bought these for him and he worked a full shift yesterday with them. He came home and said he has told all his coworkers that these are the best shoes ever. Trust me, these are much less expensive than our trip to Urgent Care and the loss of a week of work!",5,1,28
"The shoes have stylish looks and slip on great but that about it. On a scale comparing these to my Under Armor footwear, these are a 4 where Under Armor is a 10 for me.
- Terrible for walking.
- Heavy
- Stiff and wont break in.
- Foot contour is poor causing unconfutable walking or jogging strides.
- poor padding. This is my biggest complaint with this shoe.
- Soles don't have any spring or absorption so I feels like barefoot walking feeling. That about the best way personal description I can honestly give.",1,0,28
"This is a great looking shoe and looks good on foot. I was taking a risk but for $40 I figured I'd give it a try. I wanted a stylish shoe that was different than the norm and affordable. This shoe delivered. For negatives, the box was badly damaged, there was no shoe horn or stuffing in the shoe and the end of toe was slightly wrinkled...almost like I wasn't the 1st one to wear it. I was however pleasantly surprised by the cushion on the ball of the foot. It was nice to walk on. I will still add some gel inserts because I have sensitive heals but I'm glad I got these over all.
** UPDATE **
I felt bad for just leaving a 4 star rating. After putting my gel insert in these and a full day of use, I absolutely love the experience in these shoes. You get style, comfort, something outside the norm for an incredible price. Initially, there was a bias in me that couldn't give a 5 star rating to a $43 overseas shoe...but they delivered big time. I really like these shoes.",5,1,28
"Fits good , I am a big man and worried they may break down in the back but there hard plastic in the places where it needs it , the bottom is comin unglued a little on one of the bottom tentacles, you‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm talking about if you get them , they feel like the whole shoe is made of recycled material, almost like woven plastic, wipes clean well, over I am pleased and have had almost everyone think they were air max I have to show them and say I can‚Äôt afford 150 dollar shoes , I like em there comfy and have held up good a couple months now so for 40 buck BETTER GET YOU SOME.",4,1,28
Bottom of shoe falling apart by 3rd time wearing them. Maybe in total wearing the shoes less than 8 or 9 hours total since we got them. Too tight on sides for me and my ol ladys shoes are right size but too tight as well cant wear hers and mine the blue ones are retired because I dont war shoes that fall apart that fast so upset a waste of money and time.,1,0,28
"Purchased these last Thursday and wore for the first time on Sunday. Wanted some new shoes to workout and run in. First off these shoes are far from comfortable. They look great, thus the reason for me giving these shoes 2 star but you can feel everything on the ground in these. After running 30mins on a treadmil this is what happened. There is no way I could've done an hour in these. I probably would've ended up in my socks. I would give these a max 10-12 times of wear before the bottom is completely gone. Sucks because they look nice just not great quality. But I guess you get what you pay for. I purchased these and the red pair but will be returning.",2,0,28
"The shoe looks great, two times I‚Äôve worn them out I‚Äôve gotten compliments ( everybody thinks they are yeezys) on how nice they look. Though they are unfortunately not comfortable what so ever. I really want to like these shoes but they are not fit for even casual walking. Maybe with really good insoles they could be wearable. You get what you pay for. And these are cheap for a reason.",1,0,28
"These looked ""cool"" in the advertisements and photos but once we purchased them....the thrill wore off quickly. The kind of skeletonized sole is lightweight. But....kind of taller than expected, making them a little unstable for sports requiring quick turns. The soles are also kind of slippery and don't appear to have great traction on gym floors or other smooth surfaces. Overall....my kid got a few weeks of wear from them and now they're collecting dust in his closet.",3,0,28
"They look very cool, very nice color but they are made too cheaply and I could only wear them for about a month. The rubber under the shoe is very, very thin and started crumbling apart. If you step on the slightest bit of water or moisture on a floor you will slide like your on ice. The inside of my right shoe fell through the bottom of the heel part of the shoe and the shoe strings are so cheap if you pull or scratch lightly they start to like tear. The writing on the shoe are like stickers and come off and get torn very easily. Its just too pour of quality build!!",1,0,28
"The Shoe is just amazing with the way it looks for the price. I do not know the quality of life because i am returning the product.
The only problem is the upper part of the show that has clothe. I want a shoe that can hold my feet and not slip. This is exactly opposite. The clothe is little flexible so when you run or Jump, the feet kind of go forward when the shoe is intact.
This is a great shoe for running or Mild speed walking but for sure not for aggressive sport.",4,1,28
"I‚Äôve seen many in the nursing field with these same ones. Asked one of my docs how they were and he said ‚Äújust so so‚Äù. Hahaha!

Anyways, I like them. I‚Äôve had them for about a month and some and have worn them for a solid week. They work for my extremely wide and flat feet. Will be getting more for myself and the kids as well. Only thing is one certain type floors I squeak when I walk. Like I just walked through a puddle. Mildly unattractive. Lol",4,1,28
"I like the shoe looks good feels good I didn‚Äôt notice the tab on the back when I first viewed the shoe, When I got the shoe looking at it I first thought safety hazard why they did that I don‚Äôt know , you can get hooked on something so needless to say when I get in my car to takeoff that tab in the back hooked on To the seat handle adjustment underneath the seat Just saying I bought four pairs of these shoes so I‚Äôm just gonna cut the tabs off",4,1,28
"Purchased these shoes for my son over a year ago. Arch support could be better. The design of this shoe limits the tread surface on the bottom of this shoe. So if your looking for a shoe with strong traction properties required for most sports and working out, this ain't the shoe for you. The support material around the outside of these shoes is hard, so it's not the best for any activity where you might need to stop and change direction quickly. My son got very little use out of these shoes as they were not even comfortable for walking for more than 30 minutes, so we are donating them to charity.",3,0,28
"I have a bad back and thought that these would work a little better then the usual shoes, needless to say very much wrong.",1,0,28
"Love these shoes! They are so comfortable. Some shoes are uncomfortable to walk in overtime if you‚Äôre wearing them all day and then some shoes you have to break in when you first get them. But these shoes were neither of those things. They literally feel like I‚Äôm walking on clouds and are true to size. My only complaint is that the women‚Äôs sizes only go up to 10 or 10 1/2 and not 11 so I had to get a men‚Äôs size 9. I wish that the women had my size because I really like the colors they have available.

The black pair in the photo aren‚Äôt mine but my friend said they were comfortable as well.",5,1,28
"For the price, it's hard to find a slip-on ""sporty-look"" shoe that is comfortable for all-around activity, such as walking, shopping trips and the like. I found the original insole to be very thin, but a low-priced insole replacement solved that problem nicely. The lacing is more decorative than not, as the tongue is not at all free. This makes it more of a slip-on shoe, not needing to tighten with laces. So far, it has not shown any defects in manufacturing.",4,1,28
"It is a step above cheap (Insert brick and mortar Chinese cheap junk Amazon competitor name here) shoes. They are alright to jog in, they look pretty nice too. The flexible soles are pretty nice for working out.

The rubber on the bottom sole is CRAZY thin. Of you're an avid jogger, whip out that bank card. You're gonna need a new pair every other month.

If you are someone just looking for a fashionable, mostly comfortable, and importantly cheap work/casual shoe, these are great.",3,0,28
"Size 9 fits good with partial room around the foot. I'm sure a 8.5 would be too tight so I'm not complaining.

Using for work purposes, install and carrying products over grounds that may not always be dry or supplied with the best weather

I'm sure the gap hole lift will help in puddle situation, fingers cross.

Waiting to see how it's handled on a shitty day.

The extra elastic hook on back doesn't seem necessary but maybe ppl hang shoes from hooks alot.

Shoe tying could be a tigher to griping foot. Feel like if I pull the strings will snap.

Ive only rerouted the laces to feel more of a grip when tighted tight.",4,1,28
I love The styling and the effort however it caused severe left heel pain... So basically it needs more cushioning. There's folded rubber there but there's no foam inside the shoe. It looks like there's cushioning but there's not. Plus these shoes should Lean Forward just a tiny bit and they are pretty straight across flat so when you're standing straight it feels like you're leaning back on your heels and that's not a good thing. I really wanted to like these shoes.,1,0,28
"The word Running and this shoe should never be used in the same sentence. These are not running shoes. They are fashionable, reasonably comfortable but they should not be marketed as running shoes. They have zero lateral support and no heel support. I'm baffled that they are being calling running shoes. These are fashionable, nice looking and can be used for light gym workouts or casual office work. I would not wanna do 8 hours in these shoes if I was standing labor. Former USA team memeber",2,0,28
I love these. I wear a size 10 and ordered a 8.5. They fit as expected. I was a little off-put by there being no stretch when you put your foot in the shoe (I don't like to fight to put on a shoe). It was not a problem at all. I like the insoles. I had food surgery and decided to put these on and see how they worked for me. I've had them on all day and they are super comfy. I'll be ordering some in other colors. I'll work out in them tomorrow.,5,1,28
"I purchased this sneaker in a 7 men size because I am a 8.5 in woman size. The sneaker still has a little too much room, so I ended up giving it to my daughter. It fits her perfect. I just ordered a 6.5, hopefully it works out.sneakers are definitely comfortable. The cushion inside is like memory foam. While running it felt good on my feet. I have no problem except with the size, its a little off for me.",4,1,28
"I have been spending some time in hospitals lately and I have seen hospital staff wearing these so I figured they are good for walking and standing. I started asking people wearing them what they thought and everyone was positive so I bought a pair. True sizing. If you wear a 13 in Nike, you wear a 13 in these. They are light and give adequate support while standing and walking but I really don‚Äôt trust the souls to hold up running every day.

I have had lots of compliments on the looks of these shoes and one guy asked me if they were custom made because he had never seen anything like them. When I told him that he could get them on Amazon for less than $50, he was floored.

Bottom line, they are worth the money. A set of good insoles would make them a little better but they are good as is really, as long as you‚Äôre not expecting high performance for the low price. Great for walking and casual wear.",4,1,28
The same box is used for all shoe sizes and there is no label or marking on the shoe to confirm what size it is. I ordered a 12 but it was more like a 13 or 14. Can‚Äôt trust these no-name shoes. And price went up when i tried to order a smaller size.,1,0,28
" Ok ah√≠ va mi respuesta hoy me llegaron,los ped√≠ para mi size 9 (pensando que eran de mujer) y oh sorpresa fue size de hombre. Est√°n lindos,no se ven corrientes el color es muy vivo y mi esposo dice que est√°n c√≥modos .",5,1,28
"Ok, if you ask me for the looks I might give it 5 star, it definitely looks ‚Äúcool!‚Äù Though it‚Äôs pitch bright white , when I walk out I feel I‚Äôm going to get all weird attention lol.
Anyways, coming to comfort , it‚Äôs not comfort at all. It‚Äôs damn heavy for a shoe, I feel like I‚Äôm walking with a rock on my leg. Plus it doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable. Though it‚Äôs hard to expect quality of Nike or Adidas from a cheap product like this. Though after buying this I have rarely used it because every time I think about wearing it I feel why in the world I bought this.",1,0,28
"You will get what you pay for. I didn‚Äôt want to spend $200 on a pair of Nike, so I went with this Just So So. The name is aptly given. There is no support, the sole of the shoe is not even, so your foot ends up shifting inward, and the design of the rubber undercarriage pushes through the sole of the shoe when you bend your foot too much. If you‚Äôre planning on buying this shoe to wear running, or for long walks, don‚Äôt. My Havaianas are more comfortable than this shoe.",3,0,28
"I love these shoes. I bought 3 pair of them in black and white, camp blue and green, and beige and orange. Each of them fit perfectly with no issues with them in quality. I have been rocking these pretty much everyday and after breaking them in I can tell you that these may be my favorite shoes from just comfort alone. I would compare them to my adidas boost shoes from both comfort and design. I have had plenty of people now complimenting me on them and have had them ask where I got them from. Everyone is always surprised when I tell them they are on Amazon for $40, but it‚Äôs the truth! I even had someone assume these costed me $400 before I told them how much they cost me. These shoes are crazy fam! I highly recommend them to anyone that‚Äôs looking into buying a pair. I am a 245 lb black man and I wear these everyday now. Get em!",5,1,28
"I ordered these again making sure the system had the correc size input. I wear. 8 in women‚Äôs so I got a size 6.5 in men‚Äôs. It fits great! It has a lot of cushion and space around my toes and ball of my feet which are medium width. It‚Äôs deign is of breathable material allowing air to pass through the shoe better than a regular shoe. It‚Äô feels well built for running, and has a very stylish look. I think it‚Äôs great! I personally feel People with feet problems like swelling MIGHT benefit from the flexibility and breath ability of the shoe. it‚Äôs very stylish and flexible for athletes.",5,1,28
I wear a size 10 in about all my shoes. The 10's were snug but im still happy. They feel kinda cheap and the bottom of the shoe is 10x heavier than the top so they are kinda awkward just to hold lol. The insides of the shoe have this sort of cushion addition only to like the balls of your toes and under your arch so it feels really weird on your feet but after a while you get used to it. For like 30 bucks I thought these were really cool and worth the price but yes they do feel like 15 dollar shoes. Id probably still but a different pair just bcz i like the style and price.,4,1,28
"Because of a mistake I ended up with this pair and a pair from another seller. Comparing the two made this pair the greatest buy ever! Now, on their own: they feel great. The laces are decoration and the support comes from a sock type snug. But i wouldn't recommend trail runs or anything like that. It's not that snug. Update after 2 months: soles sank, uncomfortable, threw away. I by these were the best of several I've seen, but still not a good buy. Cheap, will fall apart.",2,0,28
"Love the simple tech style, the color, Seems like a good product to try. Shipment was fast! But where the heck are the in-soles? I wasn't told I needed to buy in-soles when I ordered these. They came this morning yet, I can't wear them. Either the packer didn't check or these are defective! I'm kind of disappointed but fortunately trust Amazon's customer protection. I will be returning this untouched. Hope they won't ship it to someone else.",1,0,28
My husband called me livid bcz these shoes were killing his feet after about a mile and a half (21mins) of his 3 mile walk! Luckily he had a pr of his pegasus in the truck. Even though he was wearing an insole this shoe rubbed a sore spot on the balls of his feet that's going to prevent him from walking or bike riding for a few days. If you are a serious runner/walker this is not a good shoe for you! Colors be damned it's about comfort and the shoe is definitely not supposed to cause injury to your feet. This is the definition of false advertising bcz these shoes do NOT perform as advertised. BUYER BEWARE!!,1,0,28
"I returned this simply because the shoe says Just So So but also in smaller print sets something about 400lbs ( seemed more like something that should be on a label and not stitched into the shoe, how has none mentioned this?) These shoes were for my 17 year old and he would not wear them with that writing stitched on the shoe. Looked good otherwise. He never tried them on so I am not certain of the fit. Make sure you don't mind the weird writing on the shoe before you purchase.",3,0,28
"The shoe is very colorful (obviously). It is very easy to put on but the shoe laces are somewhat difficult to tighten. This shoe is probably not good for running because of the distance between the ground and the bottom of your feet - - you could easily twist an ankle. I also am concerned about how fast the bottom of the shoe wears. If it wears too much, the ""X"" construction would quickly deform.",4,1,28
"I LOVE THESE SHOES - I am in healthcare and wear scrubs all the time - I am constantly running so when I came across this brand the reviews were outstanding so I figured I would give them a try for $40 one cant go wrong and plus the variety of colors helped to - though these are men shoes - I wear a size 8.5 in ladies so my conversion was a 6.5 in men's- I have had these shoes for about 2 months now and they are very comfortable- I get more compliments with these shoes then I do with my Nike Airs - the only concern is they do run about a 1/2 size to big however still very comfortable - I am going to order the red, white, and gray - the look just like the expensive sneakers out there - love them",5,1,28
Have only worn these a couple of times. I wear 11.5 Nike‚Äôs. Got these in 11 first and they were too small. Returned them and got 12‚Äôs. They are a little big but not so much. A 11.5 would be perfect by they are not offered. These are heavier than my Nike running shoes but they are pretty comfortable. I got a lot of compliments at the gym for how they look. For $42 shipped I figured I would give them a try. Happy so far. Will have to see how they hold up.,4,1,28
"i normally wear only Nikes, but thought id try these. bought the female size which is an 8, I usually wear 8 1/2 in womens this was the neon yellow. I also purchased the mens size , I usually wear a 6 1/2 in mens and I got the size 6 1/2 which was the greenish pair. I really loved how the mens fit more comfortably. Ive worked at my job for 25 years and walk on concreate floors for 12 to 13 hours a day.",5,1,28
"I really like these. For under $50 these shoes are worth it. I will be buying these again in a different color. I do consider myself kind of a sneaker head, i do abuse my shoes and i treat my shoes well; with that said i do see how if you are hard on these shoes they will wear down quickly. Id say light use for them for sure, walking is perfectly fine jogging might be pushing it, semi comfortable.",5,1,28
Just So So made me wake up! These are amazing from variety in colors to the quality. I stepped into a cushioned cloud. I planning on wearing these to work. Standing on my feet over 12hours plus. Let me tell you these shoes are a must have. I ordering a pair for me and my son to match. Yes they even carry little kids sizes as well. Normally I wear a size 10 in women and h wide feet. The shoe fit great and true to size. What are you waiting on add them to your cart and checkout!!!!!,5,1,28
"I have basically had all of the brand name over $100 shoes/sneakers and let me say, and I'm not exaggerating, these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet. Hard to find size 13 first of all but I am so happy with these shoes. They look like $150 shoes and feel like pillows. I will be buying more. Awesome product and thank whoever made these!!!!",5,1,28
"The look and feel of these shoes are amazing. I spend a great deal of time on my feet and usually shoes do not last me very long before they start to flatten out and I start to literally walk out of them. These still feel like I just bought them.

Update: After 5 months of normal (no working) use the anti-slip rubber covering on the bottom has started to tear off and hangs down. It is extremely thin and appears to be held on by a very small amount of glue along the inside edge. I was hoping to get at least 8 months to 1 year out of these, so, I removed 1 star.",4,1,28
"For the price I figured what the heck.
Not a bad shoe at all. I usually wear a size 10 in Adidas and Nike so I ordered size 10. They fit perfectly. They look great and are super comfortable. They‚Äôre not as light as your typical running shoe however they‚Äôre not super heavy either. ‚ÄúSomewhere in between‚Äù
I found the extra long pull tab that wraps around the back of the shoe not necessarily at all so I cut it off and singed with a lighter so it wouldn‚Äôt Frey. ‚ÄúPicture posted‚Äù
I‚Äôll come back in six months and give an update.",4,1,28
"I ordered these, to replace the shoes my son had outgrown. I had ordered a size 8 and he actually needed an 8.5-9, but that is an issue with not trying on shoes before buying, so it was a miscalculation on my end. Luckily my father was fixing to purchase a new pair of shoes, size 8, so he asked for them and they fit perfectly! I am reordering the correct size for my son now, both he and my dad love these shoes.",5,1,28
FITS GREAT AND LOOKS GOOD ON HIS FEET AND HE WEARS A 11,5,1,28
"My first pair of walking shoes, switching from skate shoes, my feet I think are mainly adjusting to them from what I‚Äôm used to. But I wouldn‚Äôt wear these if you stand still for somewhat long periods of time. I work in retail and the aren‚Äôt that comfortable to just stand in. But if you are moving consistently they are pretty good. After 2 days of owning them I walked a mile of backwoods terrain and very steep inclines. Overall these are worth the money, they don‚Äôt really have much of a break in like other shoes, it‚Äôs pretty nice. But like I said I‚Äôm adjusting from flat skate shoes so my opinion may differ from others. So short term ownership I‚Äôd overall say they are good. I have a little wider feet than average and they fit pretty well, they do have stretch and do the job of a walking shoe. I would at this point buy again but waiting on the longevity and durability of these. I can say my feet don‚Äôt hurt nearly as bad at the end of a 8-10+ hour work day so I‚Äôm satisfied thus far.",5,1,28
I Read A Lot Of Reviews Before I Buy Anything Bad And Good üëç I Work A Lot So I Got Them For My Home Shoe's They Fit Good There Not Heavy Like Some People Say I Have Nice Pair Of Nikes And There Little Heaver No Big Deal There Comfortable And Everone Is Like They Are Fire lol Means Really Nice Thanks Getting My Son The Black One's He Loves Mine And Wanted To Keep Them We Were The Same Size lol Shoe's Look Just Like The Picture,5,1,28
"I don't think it's a bad shoe for what you pay for. Quite comfortable and good bargain. However, I would not suggest going on any kind of trail where there are brush and thick weeds. I stepped on a small dry weed on my land and the twig went through the shoe and into my sock. But mt reflexes were fast enough to keep the twig from penetrating my skin. I tried to pull it out by cutting the sole open and it's there to stay. Nice shie but not safe to wear around small sticks and things. Be careful.",3,0,28
I wear a 10/11 in womens and I feel like womens tennis shoes look huge on me so I bought the mens shoe in white and in black which would be a 9/10. In other brands always try to go with a mens 9.5 just so I will be comfortable in the shoe and feel like I my shoes don't look super long. I ended up with the mens 10 which is a little big on me. I'm going to keep them for now (I still have time to return them as of writing this) however if I knew I could go down a half size I would definitely exchange them. Overall they are a confortable shoe and I've gotten quite a few complements in them.,4,1,28
So I stay away from shoes and clothes on Amazon. Mostly because they don‚Äôt look as described. But these look awesome. Feel awesome and fit ok. The run .5 size bigger. So the 11 actually fit like a 11.5 on me.,5,1,28
"My grown daughter has to wear men's shoe for the width. She likes these shoes but doesn't love them. She says they're pretty comfortable. So, now the shoes are falling apart on the soles. She has had them since July. The return window closed on August 19th. That only gave us a month. Shoes should last longer than two months.
Very disappointed",3,0,28
"If you want to look cooler than everybody else in the kitchen as you manage to slip on even a slightly damp floor these babies are it!
I was carrying a container of gravy from the back of house to the kitchen and by golly if my left foot didn‚Äôt manage to find a spot of water I didn‚Äôt even know existed. As my left foot alerts me to the ensuing disaster my arms act on their own accord throwing the container of gravy into the air but thanks to these ‚ÄúLike Mike‚Äù shoes the gravy somehow lands perfectly in a trash can six feet from where the trouble started. Would I say I looked cool doing it thanks to these shoes? Yes. Yes I would. Would I recommend wearing these in place of traditional non slip no slip shoes. Thats an expletive in all caps no.",3,0,28
"These shoes started to fall apart as soon as I opened the box to the light of day. As the fresh air touched the material made in an inferior country, they burst apart and disintegrated like a corpse exhumed from the tomb. And that‚Äôs what these shoes are: corpses. Do not buy them you would do your feet, knees, hips, back ect more good by simply walking barefoot, even if you must walk over hot coals because these shoes offer absolutely no protection.",1,0,28
"I got these shoes bc they look pretty slick, lime green and black is a pretty cool attention getter and that they do. For not being a brand that people can identify with in the US, I get quite a few compliments everywhere I go with them on and its no joke. Only issue is that these run slightly bigger so they are a bit loose, but i suppose that is better than being too tight. Very happy with my purchase and I wear them most of the time over my other brand shoes.",4,1,28
These shoes are nice to look at even thought they look like boats on your feet. They are crap shoes. I didnt even get 3 months use out of them walking to and from my car and while inside the gym. Never ran in them and still they began fall apart. The sole as you can see just came unglued. No way was l going to waste my time trying to glue them back together. What a waste of of $40. Poor customer service too. Contact Amazon directly they said. And there's a restocking fee if you want to return them so you only get a partial refund.,2,0,28
"I read a lot of mixed reviews about these shoes. Some people got a bad pair, the bottom broke, someone‚Äôs skin on their heel was peeling, etc etc. I work in the plant that builds cars, I haven‚Äôt had a bad experience with these shoes. And they were surprisingly comfortable. REALLY COMFORTABLE! At least compared to my Air Maxes that I literally bought back in February. Just So So‚Äôs are more comfortable than them and I‚Äôve been using the soles that come with these shoes. I would still recommend buying an insole for them though. And I guess some of those people wearing them that got the skin on their heel peeling was probably because they didn‚Äôt wear socks! I would highly recommend these shoes because they‚Äôre comfortable, true to size, perfect fit, great support and you can‚Äôt beat the price. You‚Äôre not supposed to wear the same shoe everyday anyway so having a few of these would be ideal. I love them.",5,1,28
"These turned out to be a bit brighter yellow than I thought they would be‚Ä¶. But I really like them! I wear them to a CrossFit gym, and they provide good support and are comfortable. They seem a little wider than my NoBulls and Reebok‚Äôs, which is a good thing for me.

I‚Äôm happy with them, and you definitely can‚Äôt beat the price!",5,1,28
"I ordered these bc of the design, it just stuck out bc of the stripes. These have a comfortable fit and looks good on the feet. Can be worn with socks and without. Fot as expected, ordered regular size. The only thing about this shoe is that it makes noises while walking. Like when a shoe gets wet and has that squishy noise. I dislike that. Not sure if that will eventually stop after shoe has been worn in some or not. Overall, I still like this shoe and glad I ordered it.",4,1,28
"I bought these since I am recuperating from Achilles‚Äô tendon surgery. They were extremely tight fitting shoes (uncomfortably tight) and a tad difficult to put on, I ordered my correct size so I was a little surprised at how tight they were. They put a lot of pressure on my Achilles so I haven‚Äôt worn them since.",1,0,28
"the shoes were about i expected from an online purchase. They came in smaller then i needed. after wearing them for four days, the tread attached to the plastic foot support started to peel off. In this manner i am greatly dissatisfied.",2,0,28
"The shoes are really nice. The only bad thing is that the inserts are horrible. After a short period of wearing them, the balls of your feet will begin to hurt and get worse over time. I had to put inserts in them to make them comfortable. I'm to invest in some Dr Scholls to make them perfect.",4,1,28
My husband honestly bought these shoes because he thought they were the most obnoxiously ugly shoes he could find. When he wears them. EVERYONE compliments him on them. Everybody else things they are really cool shoes.,5,1,28
I was excited for these shoes. Honestly didn‚Äôt like the feel of them. They threw off my whole foot causing extreme pain. I worked out in them one time and now my Plantar Fasciitis has been ignited! They are the worst purchase I‚Äôve ever made and has been sitting in their box never to be worn again‚Ä¶I wish I could get every penny back. Never again and I‚Äôve been discouraging others from getting them as well.,1,0,28
"I absolutely love the way these shoes look. Super stylish, and very flattering! People ask me about them every time I wear them. Definitely draw a lot of attention.
As a factory worker, I do not recommend these as your everyday shoe without supportive inserts. The bottoms are hard plastic, not springy, and has no give.
Great for casual wear!",4,1,28
"The sizes are inconsistently sized but they are beautiful and comfortable...
My youngest daughter has a pair that are fading but I'm not certain on why that is. I've purchased 3 for myself and don't have any problems aside from having to return 3 different times to get the correct size.
That's annoying but I have back issues so I have to keep trying to get it right.",4,1,28
"I got many compliments from these sneakers. I have SKECHERS sneakers and these are more comfortable than them. Feet feel very rested and they just feel good. I am definitely going to buy a few more pairs of them and they come in a great range of colors. You will not regret the purchase.

I wear orthotics as well as I am flat footed and these are great shoes!",5,1,28
"They look really good but thats about it. If you are looking for something comfortable-for walking, running etc these are not it. They are good for maybe going to the mall, starbucks, simple stuff as they look nice however for anything else they are just not comfortable. They are as hard as a rock.",3,0,28
The shows are beautiful. The only issue I had was that they were way too big. I ordered an 11 which is my normal size in a regular shoe. However these shoes are very wide so even with my wide size 11‚Äôs I was walking out of the shoe lol. Unfortunately I had to return them but I do intend to order them again a size down.,4,1,28
"Wear these to work & walk a lot. Ordered 2 pair. The blue camo pair has already started separating from sole to uppers. My tennis ball green pair is fine. Sure would like to be able to talk to someone or find out how to contact seller. Only had these 3 months. I hope this was just a defect in a single pair, not for all of them.",2,0,28
"My husband (the one actually writing the review) happen to see these on Amazon. Looked pretty cool. Read the reviews (good & bad) and decided to give a shot. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. They looked as they did in the pics and are surprisingly comfortable.
The only things I will criticize are: 1) even though they are comfortable, they could use a little more padding for the insoles. 2) fit well from the heel to the balls of my feet but are quite roomy from the balls to the tips of the toes. I tightened them up as much as I could. It helped a little but bunched up a bit on the top of the shoe above the toes. 3) they are slippery on hard floors when wet, and 4) a little heavier than I‚Äôm used to but I would consider getting a second pair.",4,1,28
Bought these for a friend. He wears 9.5 or 10. He got the 10 and they fit exact. Very soft on the insole as well. They look exactly as the pictures. Hope they last long. But they were a great buy,5,1,28
"Was kinda skeptical after reading the reviews, but I had to try for myself. I needed a pair of really good sneakers. Well baby, let me tell you; these sneakers are so comfortable! They feel like I'm walking on clouds! I definietly are AMAZING!!!! You won't be disappointed in purchasing them, you just have to see for yourself! I'll be purchasing another pair soon, just have to figure out what color I want to get!",5,1,28
"Don't like that loop in the back; almost 1.5"" loops out from the shoe. Extra height with the heel which I do not need; I'm 6'2"" tall. I'm a woman.
No support, you'll have to add your own support. I just wanted a normal wear shoe... store, bank, and grocery shopping.
Color is great.

I need more width, even in the shoe lace area. Hard to spread the shoe to get my foot in.",3,0,28
"They looked great right out of the box. I was so excited to get them. But I could not put them on. I have Fred Flintstone feet, wide and flat. These shoes don't have enough give in them for me to put them on. :( Instead of going through the hassle of returning them, I will be gifting them to a friend for his birthday.",3,0,28
"They look really cool but that‚Äôs about it. Very uncomfortable for me personally, I‚Äôm in the military and used these for PT in the morning for long runs and they absolutely suck. I threw them away not gonna lie.

You get what you pay for, but don‚Äôt take my word for it lol, you‚Äôll find out if you make the same mistake I did",1,0,28
"Update: 10/5/2019. 30 days out from buying these shoes. Only worn them 2 1/2 weeks. Already showing moderate wear on soles. Uber beware. Subpar shoes. Not worth the price. See photos.

Original review: This is the first time buying shoes online without trying in first. I don‚Äôt recommend that practice. I like the look of the shoe. The length is ok, but it fits snug for the size. I have custom inserts and when I removed the insert that comes with the shoe to fit my insert, I notice in the left shoe that some of the stitching was subpar and already breaking before wearing. I will be surprise if these last a month. I will be visiting a shoe store soon to purchase a different pair to have on standby.",3,0,28
"OK so these shoes are so freaking comfortable but now I'm at a crossroads. the whole front of the shoe separated from the sole on my second adventure and now is a major trip hazard. Defeating the whole purpose of it being a trail runner and now more like an I'm going to go take the trash out in my new bright green shoes shoe.... Hopefully, someone sees this and can help me out, would really like a new pair but don't want to cop out the money for a pair of hospital slippers",2,0,28
"After having these shoes for 4-5 months, the rubber sole is essentially GONE and down to plastic structure of the shoe. I should add that I am not on my feet all day, the building I work in has epoxy floors so I am not walking on a rough floor all day long. Aside from the sole of the shoe not lasting very long, after a day of wearing these shoes I can't wait to take them off.
I will absolutely not be buying another pair of these ever again.",2,0,28
"Well can't beat the comfort..ordered two more for my other half. But there were problems..why I didn't give 5 stars. The packaging in plastic bag which the shoes came crushed.
I also noticed visible glue on the shoe.
Yes..could have returned them but when my other half (who stands all day at a supermarket helping people in this pandemic ) says comfortable..believe me the word ""comfort"" is not taken lightly.",3,0,28
"The shoe has very minimal support, so I wouldn't recommend it for any kind of cardio/ running situation. I love how vibrant the red is; very rich color pay off. The shoe runs true to size, so you more than likely wont need to size up or down. I can see the glue that holds the shoe together, so i'm not sure how long it'll last. However, I'll enjoy it while it lasts.",3,0,28
bought these for the wife and she absolutely loves them. They are lightweight and supportive. She has had a very hard time finding shoes that work for longer than a week and so far she is going on a month with no issues and still prefers them over her high dollar support shoes.,5,1,28
"This is shoe is good for working out in a gym or brief circuit training. A wide ankle or foot is needed. (Primarily in the heel area)

I run 3+ miles a day outside. These were very harsh and started forming blisters along the sides of my feet. They felt more like a dress shoe. I guess this was due to the hard sole. I would recommend these shoes as ""house cats"" only. Not really an outdoor sports shoe.

If purchasing for style, go for it.",2,0,28
I typically wear a size 9 1/2 W. since there was no half sizes or Wides. I bought a 9 and a 10. The 9 was too small and the 10 was a tiny bit big. I kept the 10. Typically the same result I would‚Äôve got in a brick and mortar store with no halves or wides. And it has a great look and feel. Seems well-made,5,1,28
"I am truly surprised by how much I like these shoes!! They took a long time to get here, and they were a month early so make sure you look at the arrival date. I ordered these shoes for work shoes, and I love them. I have only got to wear them a short amount of time but have probably had them on for at least 12 hours total. The packaging was just a clear bag but these are definitely worth the money.",5,1,28
"This pair of shoes looks good but why they have laces because they gives you hard time to get your foot into it without laces. Also short in size, I had experience in having shoes from Adidas, Reebok, Nike and asics and size 8-8.5 fit's perfect but in this pair 8.5 not able to get my foot into it even no laces. So, I was not able to use them and returned.",2,0,28
"Nothing special about them. They fit and feel good. The writing is a bit obnoxious, luckily it peels off. Started squeaking after about a week. The back of the heel is almost all worn down after 1 month. Update.. source of the squeak is a piece of sole broke.",3,0,28
"The shoes are esthetically appealing a FPS feel great. I usually purchase smaller when I buy men‚Äôs athletic shoes but I went with 7 and need a 7.5. The 7 fits just right, but I have no room at the toe which is usually advised when purchasing workout shoes. I plan to wear them while working on the warehouse floor. Returning for a 7.5.
Oh no....no 7.5",5,1,28
"Honestly one of my favorite running shoes for $100 or less. They are great for running, I am training for a half marathon with them. However for walking around my feet had to adjust to the bumps, and support in the shoe. I don't know if it's the way I walk, but for the first month that I used them not when running a pressure point in my foot kept hurting to the point I had to walk to avoid putting my toes on the ground. After a while that pain doesn't appear again so I guess my foot is used to it. All together a great show for running and I get a lot of compliments for them which is nice too!",4,1,28
Good looking I get compliments on them all the time. I was hoping they would be a bit squishier since i have nerve problems in my feet. They offer NO ankle support so do not go hiking with them unless you want a twisted ankle. Almost happened to me. Also put in another insole seems to help so you may want to do that. Overall for the price I can't complain.,4,1,28
"I order my regular size but after reading alot of reviews. I decided to order the next half size up. But when I got them they where actually too big so I had to return them for my size in order in men. I am so happy with all 3 pair that I purchase. I ordered the red in men size 8, the blue and orange in women size 9.5 ( I had to up.in half size in the women though)",5,1,28
"These shoes look cool [in photos], but they are cheaply-made, heavy, and stiff. They don't offer any cushion. The sole and heel are rigid, stiff plastic. None of it is foam. They feel like they'd injure your feet or knees if you wore them for any high-impact workouts. The joining between the fabric and the plastic sole is sloppily glued on. I'm returning them and leaving a review to save someone else some time. Don't bother.",1,0,28
"I really love these shoes. I'm a nurse and on my feet all day. These are actually the first pair of shoes I've had that my feet, knees, and back isn't hurting when I get off my 12hr shift. It's difficult to explain because they don't have that soft inner cushion on the inside of the shoe like most other shoes. But yet they are really comfortable to my feet. I end up ordering 2 more pair.",5,1,28
"This is my third pair of finally getting the correct size, 9 in men turquoise color, few days ago ordered the yellow, after which I will order a red pair. I have all these expensive sneakers by Nike and I will probably wear these the most, everyone is already asking the band brand and where I purchased my son just ordered the black. I would definitely recommend...",5,1,28
"The week after they arrived the sole came off the shoe. I emailed the seller and they said to seek refund from Amazon. I will however say that for another 12 bucks, I did pick up the E6000 glue. So far this is holding up. But my son is not as active as usual due to an Achilles tendon injury. I can't i.agine what would have happened if he was active as he usually is. I will never buy from this seller again. Buy the E6000 glue thouh, this thing really works.",2,0,28
"I was hesitant on buying these ... price and the name looked sketchy... my little cousin had a picture on Instagram wearing them so i inquired and i bought these Friday. $42.99 no shipping fee!!!..lol got them Monday and wore them all day today and i am on cloud 9!.. very very comfortable. i felt like i could dunk on Lebron James or outrun Usain Bolt lol. Anyways. I recommend these. I plan on getting the black and white ones too, but yea this is proof never judge a book by its cover and to think i was about to spend $200 for some nike vapor max sneaks smh",5,1,28
"CONS: 1. Adhesive on the bottom-most layer of outer sole degraded from shuffling feet on rough surfaces.
2. My instep and feet are narrow, therefore, when I tighten my shoe, material bunches between the laces.

PROS: 1. Comfortable, even with the bunching. The mesh is very forgiving.
2. Good weighted shoe for walking and design supports heal-to-toe steps.

IMPROVE: 1. More arch support and snugness to aid those with narrow feet.",3,0,28
You wont go wrong with this purchase! They are hella comfortable. I wore them all day for my sons basketball tournament (as i stand most of the time) and they provided so much comfort all day compared to my nike air 270. I highly recommend these comfortable shoes. They also have nice padding inside of the shoes.,5,1,28
"As the women's only go up to 10.5 and I wear an 11-11.5ish. I bought men's in an 9 as I usually do when needing to convert from men to women's. Its a bit loose a, but comfortable and cheap enough for me to not hassle with a return. Just ordered a smaller pair so hopefully they will live up to the hype.",3,0,28
"Honestly, they feel clunky and look a little cheap.
They higher soles are good for wet and even slightly muddy conditions, as long as the shoe itself stays above.
Was a little disappointed, as I ended up buying a $14 pair of sneakers from Walmart that ended up much comfier and suited to actual use.",2,0,28
"Fits wide. There will be a noticeable fold along the right or left side/center when you tie the laces tight enough for the shoe not to slide around. That being said. If you just want some knock-around shoes for casual use (I use mine when I need to take the dog out), you can't beat the price. And they look pretty slick.",4,1,28
"Probably great for working out. I got mine for the comfort since I work on my feet for 12 hours. Had these about a month and, and the sides ripped open, and chunks of souls are missing. I do not recommend these shoes if you are going to use them daily for work. The creators of this shoe had banned me from leaving a bad review on their fb page. Not very trustworthy",1,0,28
"I tried using these shoes for work, but as a flat footer, these shoes made my back and knees hurt, I even tried putting insoles in them but it didn't work, but I can see how these shoes would be comfortable for people with healthy feet but definitely not for flat feet. They look cool, but they don't feel comforting.",3,0,28
"Not sure why so many people are giving this 5 stars and saying its amazing. The shoe is so so. They have hard soles that do not give that much. The shoe breathes well, but otherwise is just a good looking cheap shoe. If you need a budget shoe this is good for that. Otherwise if you are looking at getting good shoes, look elsewhere.",3,0,28
I wear these for indoor trade shows only....never outside and in only dry situations. After wearing a total of 25 times...these fell apart and at the sole and laces.....total failure and not worth the money for an business wear only. Crap product,4,1,28
These shoes were too tight and low quality. I could feel the plastic springs through the insole of shoe. After wearing them for 6 hours my feet hurt really bad. I wouldn't recommend. They look really nice though.,1,0,28
Shoes looked good were so so in the comfort but squeak really bad every time I take steps they squeak became so annoying I tossed the shoes its what I get for buying cheap Chinese goods.,1,0,28
"Definitely worth the price, and they are more comfortable than Nike believe it or not. The sole insert is like memory foam and had raised part to better mold to your feet. The sole itself is hard and firm which I like. The problem is there is no size anywhere on this shoe and they either send the wrong size or they runs a size big.",4,1,28
"A fellow RN recommended these shoes. In fact, a dozen of our staff began wearing these. I bought a pair, and the comfort/fit is great. Cost effective, and multiple colors/options for your choosing. Great arch support, and comfort. I am a 6'2"", male, 220# RN who works 12+ hour shifts. These shoes comforted and relieved my plantar fasciitis, and relieved my back spasms. Worth the purchase.",5,1,28
"The best thing I have done for my feet in years.
I walk around on a solid concrete floor 9-10 hrs per day at work.
I instantly felt the improvement the 1st day I wore these to work the next day after delivery.

Worth every penny and highly recommend these as work shoes.

I am buying another pair just for leisure.",5,1,28
Well I bought these shoes in April. It‚Äôs the end of June and the sole of the show has completely fell apart. I didn‚Äôt wear these everyday. I have shoes from 2010 that are still in good part. These were the only shoes I have ever bought that fell apart in less then 5 years.,2,0,28
"My shoes arrived a few days early, and I was ecstatic. The picture of the red ""just soso"" shoes advertised were exactly what I ordered. I normally wear a 9 & half wide with shoe, so I ordered a size 10. That was a great decision because these shoes fit my feet perfect! If you don't have a wide foot. It may be safe to order your normal size. Go buy these shoes!",5,1,28
"Runs very narrow. Hard to put on wide feet. Same for the kids version. Strap at heel was a bit too big so it looked odd. Aside from being tight and narrow, looked cool with the interesting sole. Message on shoe is odd though....says So So. Returned.",3,0,28
"Great shoes overall and very worth the purchase. They have style, comfort and support that not every sport shoe has with the padding inside. Perfect for running as it helps with thicker heels and almost a spring to each step. However, these wouldn‚Äôt be great everyday shoes to be wearing for 8+ hours. Reason being is because it does have tougher spots in the shoe that eventually make your feet hurt. Even with that being said, after taking them off and then putting them back on the next day for a workout, they feel comfortable all over again. At least for me. I‚Äôm conclusion, these shoes are great for what their purpose is. WORTH THE BUY!",5,1,28
"I like that it‚Äôs cheap. I can use it for yard work or fishing. Not as breathable as I thought it would be, kinda hot. They turned a couple heads from the crazy design, black tread on bottom started ripping off in 2 days. I‚Äôve since completely coated them in mud as I use them as junk shoes now around the yard and crabbing and fishing and changing the oil on my car and stuff like that. I don‚Äôt recommend as a serious purchase. If you understand they are a cheap shoe and have plans for a cheap shoe then buy them.",3,0,28
"I have struggled with back pain for several years due to accident..These shoes really take quit a bit of that pressure off your spine..It is like walking on a fluffy cloud of air...Very comfortable,this is my second pair,one I wear for work and one for everyday wearing...Great Product..Thanks Jeff",4,1,28
"These shoes only look good. If you are wanting to break your legs and hips, buy them. They are extremely bad when wet. I have slipped so many times and these are already in trash and not worth the risk.",1,0,28
"I wore them to work everyone asked me if they are comfortable for standing a 10 hr shift ? No they are not but everyone loves the look of them . And when they are wet at the sole they squeak so damn loud ughhh smh so don‚Äôt walk in a white room with no carpet. Lol

For comfort I wouldn‚Äôt not recommend
For the off brand Nike look I would recommend!",3,0,28
"Bought them for walking and light jogging. Had them a week, so two walks and 3 runs of 4 miles each and the black rubber (if that is what it is) is going on the heals. Also you can see some bit worn mid. They are very stiff and the feel seemed tight. I was going to stay with them until I noticed the heals.",1,0,28
"Shoes look awesome but the comfort isn't there. If they would remove those bump pockets in the sole and added more of a gel/foam the shoes would feel comfortable, but honestly you can feel the hard rubber bottom. I couldn't imagine working with these all day on my feet",1,0,28
"the right foot is not comfortable it feels like you toe is stepping on a rock, there is no cushion.
I would not buy it again the only things I can say good is that looks nice but not enough for my feet. if something I have learned in my life is that you want to feel confer in your main body support ( your feet )",1,0,28
"Been wearing these shoes for about a good month, and notice the soles, the grips, the traction is gone. I wish I taken a picture to show you all, but I don't. I just know that the sole of the is almost gone completely. All I do is walk and run and I do more walking than running. Still, unless they make it better, sorry to say its not worth the money.",2,0,28
"Great price and looks really cool. But if you‚Äôre looking for a shoe that serves its main purpose- this doesn‚Äôt stand up. Its too heavy (compared to good brand running shoes), the base is all hard plastic and doesnt seem to have any shock absorbtion as the design seems. I think its best fir casual show off type events with minimal movement.",3,0,28
"These shoes are soooo freaking comfortable!!! I have a high arch and these are an awesome fit. They don't tell everybody you've arrived on a rainy day with all the squishy noise. One thing I would change is to add a thicker insole/cushion (even without adding, they're still perfect). Definitely getting a few more pairsüôÉ",5,1,28
"It fits pretty good for the most part, just a little tight around the small toe. I usually wear 10 1/2 W. I got the 10 because people said it ran big, and there is no 10/2 option. The 10 would fit perfect if it wasn't for how narrow the shoes are. They look great though and feel okay minus just being a little cramped at the end.",4,1,28
"I ordered these for my fiance because he goes through so many shoes. He is a delivery driver and he is constantly on his feet. Well, he's obsessed! His first impression of them, not going to lie, he was a bit skeptical because of the support in them. Well let me tell you, I ended up buying a pair and Ive never felt anything like it it any shoe! So comfortable! When he gets home, he's not complaning that his feet are hurting. These are legit! So legit that we are both buying a second pair.",5,1,28
"Nothing to dislike......my arch is high so I use a shoe horn to put most of my shoes: the manufacturers for this product have included a strap on the heel to help seating my foot into this shoe. Good idea....they are extremely light and comfortable,.I am very satisfied with this purchase.",5,1,28
Soles ware fast. Have been wearing for about a week and a half and the heal is almost bald already. Yes they are cheap so its expected i guess. Also they are very narrow i dont use wide sizes but i would with this brand. Otherwise great sneaks,3,0,28
I wanted to love these shoes but I can't. The look and color are great but don't be treated; there's no support and not good for working out. I purchased man size instead of woman because they ran small and narrow; well guys are the opposite. The make of the shoe seems good but the build is off; if you're still going to buy then just know you'll need some type of insert to support your feet.,2,0,28
With all the positive reviews here I thought I'd take a chance on these. I wear a size 12 and struggled getting them on with the integrated sock style. I wore them for one day and they were so uncomfortable that I can't wear them again. I bought them for the looks and learned my lesson.,2,0,28
"Definitely won‚Äôt buy this product again but you get what you pay for. One of my friends had a pair and they look amazing, which is why I rated a 3 star, but they are noe comfortable at all. I definitely will not wear to work again and would never work out with them. I was really disappointed.",3,0,28
"OMG these shoes are way awesome i own /wear all the top brands from nike air max shox, these shoes for the price are seriously amazing i just got them and protected them i hope they hold up. I am a 9.5u.s. but after reading the reviews and took the suggestion i ordered the size 9u.s. and i am glad i did i will be placing an order after this review for 2 other colors. Btw i ordered the grey since it is winter now",5,1,28
I am a female Registered Nurse with really big (size 12) and somewhat wide feet. I‚Äôve struggled over the years to find shoes that fit properly and were comfortable. Every pair of shoes I‚Äôve ever bought either fit properly OR felt ok but never both. These shoes are the perfect fit AND they‚Äôre super comfortable. If you‚Äôve had the same struggles do yourself a favor and give these a try. You won‚Äôt regret it!,5,1,28
"These shoes are comfortable for walking or exercising but not for standing long periods of time. I work part time at Amazon and had to put insoles in for added comfort. They also seem to stretch a bit after continuous wear. Other than that, very cute colors and fashionable.",4,1,28
"Love these shoes they are very comfortable. As soon as put them on I knew I had to buy 2 more pairs. I recommend anyone that have foot problems or want some comfortable shoes to walk , run or excercise in. These shoes are the one for you",5,1,28
"These shoes are very comfortable even with my size 13EE foot.

Pro:
Comfortable.
Actually fit my foot (once I get my foot past the opening).
Very well vented.

Con:
Difficult to get foot in.
Rubber sole started to detach day one ( super glue solved problem).
Longevity is Doubtful.

Rated four stars just for comfort alone.",4,1,28
"Very nice shoe, comfortable fit once you are able to squeeze your feet into them! Not sure why the opening is so small?? One thing for sure is they ain‚Äôt coming back off without muscle. Maybe shoe stretchers will fix this for me!",4,1,28
"The shoe has no traction the bottoms are very slippery I stepped on a little water outside walked inside and almost fell, but I was able to catch myself thank God. After I Caught myself I started walking again and slipped again and fell. So I took the shoes off and started to return to Amazon. They refunded my money with no problem. I do not recommend these shoes because they are not safe for walking inside even if you have the slightest amount of water on the bottom of your shoe you will slip and possibly fall like I did.",1,0,28
The shoes have no arch support. They are very uncomfortable. They're too big for me but was hard to get my foot in the shoe if that makes sense... Cute shoe but it has the quality of the shoes you'd get at a local beauty supply store. Just my opinion...,2,0,28
"My goodness. They look like theu would be great for a workout but opposite. You feel everything. After a 30 minute walk on the track, I was feeling it. Also, the shoe says it for itself... : ""Just so so"" I kid not. The weiring on the shoes is pretty random with numbers in places and on yhe side it says just so so! Ha",2,0,28
Not bad value. I use them for walking and weigh 205 pounds. Would like to have more inner sole padding with better arch support and more impact shock dampening. Nice looking and good build quality. They are perfectly fine for tourist strolling.,3,0,28
Pros: very comfortable and light. Great price. Cons: challenging for an older guy to put on. Very tight to insert foot. Smell: they smell like rubber tires... had to leave them outside for two days before they didn't smell anymore...,3,0,28
"I went to the falls and bring these pair with me to hiking, these are so comfortable I walk around 3.5 hours and my feet feels good after that. Color is great, people ask me about my shoes every time.

I will try another pair soon.",5,1,28
"Looks great however these are casual wear shoes, they are not for running/working out. I wear size 11 and am 185lbs, wore them for a run and turned around after a mile as there is no heel support, put on my nikes for training, these for hanging out with the kids around the house",2,0,28
"Im an ICU nurse, and have been working insane hours. Was ready to drop $200 on a pair of Asics. A buddy told me about these, I was skeptical because of the price. They fit awesome and feel great standing all day",5,1,28
"I bought this pair for my husband. Saw a lot of excellent reviews from those in the medical field and if they approve they have to great support, right? Well they are !! Without him knowing he hasn‚Äôt complained about his back or knees in weeks!! Plus everyone thinks his shoe game is on point!!",5,1,28
shoe was just slightly larger than expected but not a huge problem since I like to slip my shoes on and off. I mainly use these shoes for casual wear and have gotten lots of compliments on the style and color. I've only worked out in them once but I had no comfort issues. I caught these on sale for $29 because I wear a size 13 but they are worth the deal I got for sure.,4,1,28
These shoes are as beautiful on the website as it is in person.. I love these shoe and the color is to die for..ü•∞ü•∞ the comfort is amazing wouldn‚Äôt lie.. the next best shoe to puma because puma is my favorite.. and now these shoes is my 2nd favorite..,5,1,28
For 46.00 you can‚Äôt go wrong with these sneakers. The styles are spot on and the quality of construction is great. You put a swoosh on these and you pay 150.00 to 200.00. As a sneaker collector I know a good quality sneaker. I‚Äôve already bought 2 more pairs for my wife.,5,1,28
"These shoes are very comfortable and they draw a lot of attention! I‚Äôve never had so many compliments on my sneakers! Be leery of purchasing these shoes from some other vendors here on Amazon because, I found out the hard way, some are not quality at all! This is a trusted vendor!",5,1,28
If you are getting Size 13 they are going to be tight for you at the beginning because you need a break a man they do feel a little weird in the bottom that‚Äôs just because they have that opening but these are great for walking and running shoes the only problem that I have with them is that they don‚Äôt go bigger and wider that‚Äôs the only problem,5,1,28
"Love these shoes. So comfortable . I walk every morning with no problem.
Lots of compliments. I'm a size 8 but bought the 6.5 in men.
Will be ordering more in different colors.

Update ordered 2 more pair. They are great.",5,1,28
"I read the negative reviews, but I wanted these to match an outfit. I have pronation in my ankles. These sneakers are made such that they encourage pronation based upon the way they are manufactured. Also, there is a bubble in the inside of the sole that pops up and down when one walks. Just too flimsy for the money. Buyer beware.",1,0,28
So far so good fit perfect comfortable I have flat feet for a woman I'm also tall so it makes my feet big so I got a 12 men because I wear a 13 in women these shoes are very comfortable I can't wait to buy more I think I want the gray and the yellow ones next,5,1,28
"tennis totalmente piratas, sin ninguna etiqueta ni siquiera el numero del calzado. talla mal por lo mismo que son falsos. compre dos pares y los dos los devolvi. no se como Amazon se presta para estas cosas. deprimente en serio",1,0,28
"I purchased these as strictly walking shoes. 5'9"" 170lbs. After two months of warm dry climate and never been wet, the left shoe has developed a ""squeak"" in the heel somewhere. Every step equals a loud squeak. The other issue is the lettering is starting to peel off the shoe. If I was still in the window to return or exchange I would.

Nice shoe, fits and feels comfortable, but at this price there are going to be tradeoffs. Lifespan being the biggest.",3,0,28
"Did me well for the airport! Tremendous amounts of walking & I love them! I ordered a half size up, usually in men‚Äôs I wear a 7.5 so I ordered an 8 & they are perfect!! Of course without socks don‚Äôt curse me lol but these details are necessary for your order I say do it",5,1,28
The sneakers are heavy. Granted yes they are men's sneakers. I thought they would be a little lighter in weight since they are tailored for workouts and active wear. Dope design. So do we have more of a cushion inside the sneaker but now that I I'm aware that the same design sneaker is sold in women's I'm more inclined to purchase another pair but women's sizes.,3,0,28
"The insert is super weird with random raise points, overall uncomfortable and stiff.",2,0,28
"My toes are jammed in. the heal is also very uncomfortable. Hard plastic, and very narrow. Shoes are very uncomfortable. i ordered larger to be safe sine im a 10.5, i ordered 11 and its extremely tight.",1,0,28
"Based on some press and reviews on this site I was expecting a great priced ‚Äòunicorn‚Äô performance shoe that would rival Asics, Nike, ardidas, etc. these do not. They are no way close. On the flip side - they are not a horrible shoe for the price. These are $42 shoes. Equivalent to the lowest level shows from ASICS, Nike, etc.",2,0,28
"I‚Äôve had these for a few weeks now. With all honesty the shoe looks nice, but for 40 dollars unfortunately you are not getting the top notch technology for support and comfortability. When you walk, you feel the stuff under your feet, it‚Äôs like something is stabbing your feet. I believe that if there was more layers in between the sole and the foot this shoe would be great. Unfortunately I have realized that when it comes to great comfortable shoe it‚Äôs better to spend the 120-200 dollars to have a shoe like Hoka that will last you a few years and feel amazing under your feet. My advice don‚Äôt cheap out, spend the extra money get a hoka or On Cloud.",3,0,28
"I love these style and brand shoes. I Now have three (3) pair: these yellow , a green and a turquoise pair. Next time is the red pair. The only draw back. You just about have to get some arch support insoles for these.",5,1,28
"I thought these shoes were going to be awesome and they still do look awesome, but wtf...they have ""just so so"" written on the side and back! In the photos everything is reversed and I thought the words were all backwards an different which was cool. This was the main reason I bought them!! Regardless, I'm still going to wear them, but hopefully I don't get laughed at with them reading ""just so so"" on the side and back. Really dumb words to choose for a shoe. They need to reverse the print or put their brand on them or something.",2,0,28
I love the feel when you‚Äôre wearing the shoe. Very comfortable inside. I bought these shoes to wear for lots of physical activity and running. Bad idea. I ran maybe three 1/2mile laps on a rubber track and the rubber on the sole of the shoe is already ripping off. There is very little rubber on the sole so it will wear very quickly. As for the fancy open sole design I was assuming it was rubber so there would be a bounce in the step. Unfortunately it‚Äôs all plastic. It flexes but under a lot of pressure as if you forced the shoe to fold in half. So be aware of that. But other than that the shoe would be a very good fashion shoe. Lots of compliments my first time wearing. But not very good for working out at all.,2,0,28
These shoes are so bright they will blind you in the light. My husband got a lot of compliments on the shoes because of the brightness of the color. They do get dirty easily but it all comes out in the wash with OxiClean. We will be buying the other colors as well.,5,1,28
"These are some awsome athletic shoes,light weight,easy on and off.BEAUTIFULY structured and colored.Have had so many compliments on their style that after purchasing myself a pair,my daughter throws a lil sad face at me wanting herself a pair. They come in so many colors, you can wear the same type of shoe daily, just change the colors to match practically anything. My sons birthday is the 8th,he wants them for his daily running shoe.The whole family will be sporting these stylish,comfortable kicks...Thanks Amazon,AGAIN!!!",5,1,28
Good running shoe but it gets very messy if you run or walk over muddy areas. All dirt gets stuck between the holes below and you better shake it or rinse it before you get home and THAT TAKES TIME! so far good comfortable running shoe,4,1,28
"Same size as Nikes.
Awesome shoe for the price.
Due to the soles construction, with hard use parts of the soul will start to peel it can be easily repaired with shoe Goo stronger than are the manufacturers. For the price you can't beat it it's like wearing slippers all day with a spring in your step.",5,1,28
"I have two pairs of these for myself. Love them. Bought a pair for my teenage son his broke in about a month! Maybe the larger size doesn‚Äôt hold up as good!? I‚Äôm a size 8 or 6 in men‚Äôs and he is a size 11.5 in men.
Mine are still good and I wear them daily.",2,0,28
"I use these for my walks/workouts. I cant believe how good these are for the price. Probably going to order another pair. They are comfortable, they look really good. Yes they have some weird writing on the side so I wouldn't wear them at a public gathering where people may try and reads what it says (it's nonsense basically), but other than that, theyre fine.",5,1,28
"I bought these in men size 6.5, because they didnt have an 8.5 in women. I know to buy a 7 in men next time. these fit exactly. I am going t keep these, but the next pair I order will be a men size 7.",5,1,28
Very attractive shoe. After a few months of use I noticed the shoes began squeaking on certain flooring like linoleum. Been also using on bike rides and they perform well. The fit is a little loose. Unable to adjust to a tighter support as the shoe doesn‚Äôt not have that extra eyelet to perform a heel lock. I ordered 11 and next time I‚Äôll have to order 10 or 10 1/2,4,1,28
"Awesome shoes but they fit too tight. Reading reviews, people mentioned go with your true size so I ordered a size 13. I might go a size up next time. The bottom start peeling after making a few cuts while playing with the youth in a local mall. Nothing superglue can fixed but it shouldn‚Äôt happened. Not complaining due to the price for an stylish okay/comfortable shoe.",3,0,28
"These shoes have a stylish appearance but fit about a size smaller than what is described. They are also heavy for an athletic shoe and do not flex easily, the sole is very stiff.",3,0,28
"They look alright and they‚Äôre definitely a conversation starter. However, they are not very comfortable and I don‚Äôt find them suitable for running. The soles feel heavy and hard from the inside.",2,0,28
"One of the shoelace holes ripped on my 2nd day wearing these shoes. The shoes look nice, but seem to be cheap quality.",1,0,28
"Tried these out just following the trend they are alright thought it would have been a little more comfortable but the will do, I do love the colors I just wear them to work in so I won't mess up my good shoes, they are a great price!!!",4,1,28
"I love everything about the shoe, just wish they didn‚Äôt squeak the way they do. I‚Äôve only had them a week! They look great and are also pretty comfortable. Would easily be a 5 star if it wasn‚Äôt for the squeak, not sure if I got a defective pair or what the deal is. Considering buying a different color just to see if they also squeak the same way.",3,0,28
I purchased this shoes to play basketball. Played 4 games of bball to 15. by the end I had all kinds of trouble with plantar fascia. If you want to destroy your feet this product will do just that in a short period of time. terrible product avoid buying or using at all costs. not even worth free.,1,0,28
"Got these for my 10 year old. His feet are growing so fast and I didn't want to spend a lot on new shoes. Definitely expected them to last more than 27 days though. That's how long it took for them to snap and have the bottom rip off. That's not even 27 days of usage, that's 27 days of ownership. He only wore them 10x.",3,0,28
"I have gotten so many compliments on these shoes ever since I started wearing them to work. With driving a forklift and standing on concrete floors 10 hours a day, I needed good supportive shoes and these definitely fit the bill. However today I noticed the bottom of the shoes started separating and I've only had and worn them for about 2 weeks. Even with them being a cheaper shoe I expected them to hold up better than this. I could have gone to Walmart or Target if I wanted shoes that would do that in such a short time span.",3,0,28
"The reason for my three star review is, the first pair of shoes we received came apart after a week of light wear. We returned them (painless process) for another pair and so far so good with durability. My son likes the shoe and says their comfortable.",3,0,28
"These are great shoes... very comfortable
Wish they would make 1/2 sizes past 13! I wear them without socks!! Also they have good insoles but not for my gait! I pronate! I ordered some for me!! I‚Äôll update when I do my 1st workout",5,1,28
Have had the shoes as a daily shoes and work shoes and workout shoes and they're pretty good just like their name there so so They are easy to clean Easy to put on however the bottom grip on the shoes wear out in disappear way too quickly I have had these shoes for 4 months and The grip is already I was worn out,4,1,28
At first was great for working out and everyday use but the stitching/flue around soles started coming undone after use. I caught it early so maybe some glue can help but for everyday use dont expect them to last long,3,0,28
"They are not ok in comfort, they are kind of heavy, the style is the best feature the look really good on my feet. Measure your feet to make sure you get the correct size using the chart.",3,0,28
"Absolutely love these! Bought them for my boyfriend and I and we wear them almost everyday. We get compliments everywhere we go. Definitely would purchase these in other colors! So comfortable and I believe they fit true to size!

Follow me on IG for more amazon finds and reviews justbeautyjule",5,1,28
"Ordered two different pairs snd both had the same issue. Deformity on the inside of the left shoe that causes a hard rubber part of the sole to dig into your heel.
They do look very nice but i had to return mine.",2,0,28
Bought these for my husband and he normally wears a size 9 so that's what I bought but they seem to be a little big. He says they're fine but he has yet to use them for running or working out. But says they are very comfortable for walking.,4,1,28
Purchased several pair for my son. They look nice and he says they are very comfortable. He is on his feet all day so that says a lot. Very satisfied with this purchase.,4,1,28
"I really like the comfort and colors of these sneakers, my only concern is why they would choose to write just so so on the side of the shoes. I originally thought who cares but after wearing them I'm not really pleased with it. They are also running larger than expected",4,1,28
"I was really reluctant to order these. However, these have exceeded my expectations. Therefore, I would recommend these! I have gotten compliments and people asking where I got them on a daily basis. They are really helping with my lower back as well, which is the reason I got them.",5,1,28
"Bought them for work. The fit is really good. I have wide feet and they fit great for that. Maybe need a new insoles, because I ‚Äúthink‚Äù the ones these have might not be good for very long. Am happy with my purchase!!",4,1,28
"The bottom of the shoe started coming unglued.

There is also thin / limited padding around the heel, so you start to feel the structure of the sole.

All this after a week of use. You can tell by the picture that the shoes are new.",1,0,28
"They fit, they look good and are a good deal. I don't know that I'd train in them but for general activity/walking and lifting at the gym they feel decent. They don't provide as much lateral support as frontal for me but they do feel good, it's only been 2x (~4-5hrs) in the shoes since receiving them so we'll see what happens over time.",3,0,28
"The colors are pretty, and the shoe fits well if sized correctly, but the materials are cheap, the padding is laughable, and the sole is deeply uncomfortable, like my racist uncle.",2,0,28
"It was really a surprise to encounter this shoes by accident on Amazon and it was better than what I had expected!
The price is much more affordable than the Nikes! It's not as super comfortable as the $200 Nikes Max, but that this price, it's well worth it! And I got a lot of people telling me that the shoes looks really nice . It's very light and comfortable to wear. It's an alternative now during the Pandemic, when money is tight.",5,1,28
"The soles came apart after the first week of wear. We glued them. They were light weight, comfortable, & breathable. For the cost they held out for summer & were tossed.",3,0,28
"Ordered Feb 18, 2021... delivered Feb 20, 2021... The good: shoes are comfortable... used for every day morning walk..
The bad: they do not last.. see the pics... after 2 and half months of use, the sole is worn, and separated... so basically, going to the trash can... not recommended",2,0,28
"I usually buy wide sneakers but these seemed a bit wide and indeed some reviewers said they were. They are not. They hurt my feet because my toes are crammed together from the side of the shoe. Otherwise, I like the sneakers. Too bad.",3,0,28
My third pair lol but order men‚Äôs 6.5 in this shoe and to me this shoe size it more comfortable than women‚Äôs 8 (my size and what the 1st pair I bought is). My second pair is a 7 in men‚Äôs and they are a lil big but I kept them anyway,5,1,28
"They are not a good pair of shoes
CONS
Heavy
Uncomfortable
Stiff
Make odd sound when you walk
Weird pads inside the shoe

PROS
easy to put on
inexpensive
Seem durable
Fun looking",1,0,28
Bought these mainly for work 12 hr shifts of constantly on feet they have support in heel under arch and in the front fit well and very comfortable for any surface,5,1,28
By the end of the first week I had them the soles started to fall apart. The heel support could use a little bit more of a durable material as well because standing up I noticed it felt as if I was leaning back because of the poor quality of the material over flexing. They also pick up a lot of pebbles and rocks that you can feel once trapped in the sole because of the design so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend these for outdoor activities unless you are on a smooth surface or strictly gym use... Aside of the soles these look good and the stitching is well done. Has a lot of potential they just gotta use better quality material for the soles,1,0,28
"The most uncomfortable shoe I have ever put on. Do not waist your money on this trash, build quality isn‚Äôt bad but the shoe for what it‚Äôs purpose is, is terrible. Better off buying second hand shoes from a thrift shop that don‚Äôt have tread left on them or insoles and would still be more comfortable.",1,0,28
"Perfect size 13 fit. These shoes have been out in the NW Montana winter for a couple weeks. I don't jog or work out but they have great traction on the snow, pavement hard ground. They have been comfy with great cushioning, but not overly so. At this price these are an amazing shoe and would highly recommend!",5,1,28
" My grandson loved these shoes, unfortunately they were not the quality we expected. He has had them for maybe 2 weeks. This is what has happened. I would either like a replacement pair or my money back.",1,0,28
"The shoe looks great. It's very light for running. The only downside is that the show is slightly longer than my actual size. if I went one size down, it would be to small. But besides this, the shoes don't slip off when running at all.",4,1,28
Too narrow in the front right after the toes. No half sizes. No width choice. The tongue is attached which to me means it will rip if used Frequently. Otherwise nice looking.,2,0,28
"Ok people, this is the most comfortable shoe I own. I'm 50 years old and can buy just about any shoe I want. These shoes are so comfortable. I highly recommend the UMYOGO shoe. No kidding. You will not regret it.",5,1,28
These shoes are BOMB! They‚Äôre SO comfortable & true to size! I bought the red ones first and I put my dad on & he bought me the purple ones (which is my FAVORITE color)! I‚Äôm buying another pair in two more weeks (the yellow pair) and then going from there until I‚Äôm satisfied lol. I also bought my kids the red ones to match mine! You won‚Äôt be disappointed! I just hope they don‚Äôt go up on the prices because I‚Äôd much rather spend $45 opposed to $85+ & the color combos are LIT!,5,1,28
I felt the spring action was propelling me to do as best as I could. I'm on my feet for 8 plus hours a day and these new style shoes proved to be a benefit. I think they fit although I could have eaten too much salt the night before. A little tight when I put them on but by the end of the day my fees were thankful.,4,1,28
"The only thing I will say is good about the product itself is the design. After two days my foot was numb, but it was so uncomfortable that I went back to my walking shoes and that has been a huge relief. If not for a pretty good design, I would rate it one star.",2,0,28
"The sole of the shoe is falling apart. Haven‚Äôt worn frequently and I don‚Äôt abuse these either (no heavy/extensive exercise, not work for work either, I‚Äôm 220lbs, no hiit exercises either. Just poor quality.",3,0,28
"The product fits well, however not much support, and if you walk and your heel hits anything but the memory foam, they are hard as rocks and painful. I should have ordered a size larger, as it says these run true to size, and they did not for what I typically wear.

Also , the pictures in the ad show a slightly loose, logo strap on the back of the shoe. The actual gap is way bigger than in the ad (see pics attached) making them extremely odd looking to a point I wouldn‚Äôt wear them. I cut the straps off to better the appearance.",2,0,28
"I absolutely love them. They are amazing and have a great price point. These are more comfortable than many of the other pricey name brand shoes I own. I‚Äôll definitely be buying the same shoe in other colors, because they‚Äôre also quite fashionable as well!",5,1,28
"The shoes are everything! They are comfortable, they look get (got a lot of complements) and they are durable. I worked a 12 hour shift in these and my feet felt good afterwards. I will be ordered other colors and I can't wait for them to come in.",5,1,28
This is the best shoe ever. I am on my feet about 10 hours a day in these shoes and to date my feet are thankful. I had a double knee replacement and any shoes I purchased after my surgeries have never come close to the comfort I am experiencing with these shoes. I am looking at purchasing another pair just deciding on the color.,5,1,28
My 11 year old wore these for one afternoon to weight lifting class at his school and they are already coming apart. Don't waste your money! He takes excellent care of his shoes and I usually buy him expensive shoes. His friends had this kind and suggested that he get a pair. Now I'm headed to buy him some shoes that will last.,1,0,28
"Many times a Nike 11 will fit me just fine, sometimes I am a 12. 11.5 is the best but that was not an option with this shoe. The 11 didn't fit me and was to short and so had to send them back. if you are a half size try the higher size.",3,0,28
I wore these to go with my Greenbay Packers attire! Well I didn‚Äôt get many compliments on Greenbay but these shoes were a hit!!!! I got soooooooooo many compliments! People had a hard time believing I only paid around $40 bucks for these shoes! I wish they ran smaller than a 6 1/2 but that‚Äôs just splitting hairs... lol,5,1,28
Did not last my husband two months before they started falling apart. He is pretty active so this shoes were a disappointment. Save your money and buy a quality shoe.,1,0,28
"Nice shoe, and looks like it is well made. It is comfortable for my workout use and treadmill walking. I do not use these shoes for outdoor activities. Worth the price.",4,1,28
"not comfort at all , i wear little have to trash it",1,0,28
"The rubber tread started separating from the sole the first week then the upper and lower the next week. Fixed it with shoe goo but...
Other than that kinda fun and pretty comfy",2,0,28
"Definitely better than I expected. I been doing a lot of sprints and running every other day for the last couple of weeks on them, no cosmetic or structural issues after wear so far and I been known to be really hard on my shoes. As far as support they are just the same as a Nike or Adidas. I put a pair of orthotics in them and now I have the comfort and looks of a high end shoe brand (sometimes those don‚Äôt even have support either).",5,1,28
"Less than 4 hours of use and it‚Äôs already falling apart. The fact that it caused me to trip and destroy the work I‚Äôve spent the last 3 hours building, aside, the shoe isn‚Äôt that comfortable. A waste of money in my book.",1,0,28
"I was a bit surprised at the comfort of this shoe. The sole is a tad heavier than expect, but the comfort really makes up for the weight! I highly recommend this pair of shoes!",5,1,28
Love the fit and support. Great fit around the heel and plenty of arch support. Size is a bit on the small size go a lil bigger in my opinion,5,1,28
"great item for not so much money and they feel good in the gym and during everyday walking, who needs to spend a $100.00 or better for name brands while this item sacrifice",5,1,28
"They fit well and are very stylish! Gotten a couple compliments at work and out and about. Only complaint is they're heavier than I thought they were going to be. Not a deal breaker though, but might be some extra work with running which I don't mind.",4,1,28
These sneakers are rather comfortable and for as expected. For the price these can‚Äôt be beat! They are also hilarious because they say ‚ÄúJust So So‚Äù on them so when my friends ask how I‚Äôm feeling I just point to the sneakers and laugh. Quality product!,5,1,28
"Not true to size run small, shoes look nice but I can‚Äôt fit my feet in them and seller won‚Äôt take return , but offered 20% back as best offer. Don‚Äôt waste your money !",1,0,28
"These are great shoes for the price. They make good work shoes with no slip souls. Ladies, men's shoes are great if you can't find a women's half size. I wear an 8.5, bought orange women's 9 and just put an insole in. The men's 7 is a much better fit.",4,1,28
This shoe is so comfortable. I have a hard time finding shoes that fit well and I like. I am on my feet all day and they are so comfy. Walking in them my feet don‚Äôt slide and they are just so comfortable. I have gotten so many compliments!!!! Only downfall is that I do not like they have the weight limit written on both side of this shoe. Can not really see it but just do not like that. Recommend!!!,4,1,28
"I went with this off-brand as a result of the 10k+ good reviews, but after getting them they were too large, larger than a normal size for me. They were not comfortable at all, bouncy but to firm at the same time, hard to explain. Also at first I thought the graphics would look cool but I did not like the look in person. I'm glad so many people really liked these but I could not force myself to agree.",1,0,28
"A bit wide but extremely comfortable , not too fond of the larger strap on the backside of the shoe but I can live with it , overall I‚Äôll definitely buy another pair",5,1,28
It was very bigger than expected and bulky. The design itself isn‚Äôt so bad and the comfort is decent for its price range. However I did not like the strap located on the back side which looks to tacky so I ended up returning it.,1,0,28
"I (female age 42) originally bout myself a pair of red ones, my son wanted his own pair and chose the men‚Äôs black w/red lettering. We both love our shoes.",5,1,28
First time ever buying a pair of sneakers online. What a great and pleasurable purchase this has been. Transaction and delivery was quick and phenomenal. End result the product was perfect and comfortable. Will definitely be buying again from same seller. Highly recommend.,5,1,28
"Paid reviews for sure‚ÄîI bought into the hype that ‚Äúnurses rave about these shoes they wear all day!‚Äù Feels like I‚Äôm wearing bricks under my feet. Uncomfortable, plastic doesn‚Äôt give so in essence zero shock absorption.",1,0,28
Would not purchase again,2,0,28
"I work at an airport ramp and I bought these shoes because of the price, I have gotten may compliments about the shoes and I must say they have stood up too some long days working outside on the ramp. I replaced the sole of the shoe with something better and the only complaint I have would be that pieces of the grip have started to come off after about 4mo of intense usage. I would defiantly recommend these shoes if your on a budget and want something that will last and look great.",4,1,28
Comfortable. Today is day one of wearing them fresh out of the box and the sole is already peeling off the bottom of the shoe! I should not have to super glue new shoes!!!,3,0,28
"So these shoes are called just soso and that‚Äôs exactly what ya get.. not quite one star but two.

I bought these for 35$ on prime day and for that I will wear em but laugh every time I walk and hear the plastic clicking coming from em. Plastic bottom , no arch support although they do put a few foam inserts in the sole they will get smashed quickly.

If you want shoes just for show ok. If you plan to wear 12 hours a day.. don‚Äôt get these.",2,0,28
" The shoes fit nice, but the waffle support cracked in under 6 months. I walk in them daily, run in them rarely.",3,0,28
I did have to send it back because my feet are a size 8 and I had to go lower like a size 7 or 6 but my feet it just be like that for all shoes sizes but over all It looks great and but it was Comptable,5,1,28
"I have written a nice review as I have bought multiple of this brand, but the quality now sucks, they squeak when I walk on the floor,.. and they‚Äôre terrible. Returning and never ordering again",1,0,28
I love my shoes I‚Äôm shears getting stopped asking where did I get them. They are super comfortable and have really good support. If you buy them I promise you won‚Äôt be disappointed!,5,1,28
Cute shoes but not comfortable. Didn‚Äôt perform very well during workout nor treadmill activities. I had to purchase men‚Äôs since my size wasn‚Äôt available in women‚Äôs.,3,0,28
"This is a good shoe for the money, I have two pairs, nice roomy toe area and fairly comfortable. Compared to Nike which is way over priced, these shoes are acceptable.",4,1,28
The shoe fits as expected. With my experience however after wearing for an extended period I noticed extreme soreness along the side of my feet. The also makes your feet look bigger.,4,1,28
Type 2 diabetes requires me to watch my feet. I change shoes often as to not affect my feet. Still breaking these in. Had a little toe pain on first wearing. Hope to wear more in next 2-3 days. Will see about how they feel while walking.,4,1,28
Super cute and remind me of the brand Off-White! I love them. Bought them for a trip to Disneyland and they were perfect! My back starts to hurt in my vapormax after walking a lot and I had no back pain at all in these shoes! Never in my life have I received so many compliments on a pair of shoes!,5,1,28
I bought these shoes thinking I was the only one that was going to have them turns out a lot of people have them they are great pair of shoes very comfortable stylish I have no complaints I have four pairs,5,1,28
"The shoe looks cool but it‚Äôs definitely not comfortable. When you first put them on if feels like you have something hard stuck under your heal. Then as you wear the shoe it starts to feel a little better but still uncomfortable. I wore them for about 3 weeks now and still the same everyday. When it comes to price of the shoe, in my opinion they look better than a lot of other shoes the same price but, I have definitely bought shoes from Walmart or Kroger‚Äôs that are way more comfortable.",2,0,28
"I got this product for my dad that have a wide foot but its too narrow in the tongue of the shoe.
everything except that seems match with our expectations.

pd: we are fixing the shoes with the shoesmaker by expanding it with a machine.",4,1,28
Great looking shoe feels comfortable great support I haven‚Äôt worn them very long but I‚Äôm hoping they last for the price you can‚Äôt beat it and very bright,5,1,28
This style shoe is so stylish wore mine to work & got so many compliments and ppl asking where they can get a pair I told them on Amazon. I love these they are very comfortable. I wear a 9 I actually could have ordered a 8.5 very roomy. I will be ordering more pairs the colors are cool the shoes are not just stylish but verrrry comfortable.,5,1,28
Of you have a high instep these look nice but run narrow go 2 sizes up. Not comfortable i bought gel soles better but i had to send them Back twice.,3,0,28
"Overall not bad for price but the yellow is VERY bright yellow and not mustard yellow as pictured on Amazon.
Fit is decent but sides at ankle bone are very high and rub.",3,0,28
"I thought they would be comfortable from all the reviews I read. I tried them out for 5 hours during my work shift, and the first hour I was like no not going to work, no real support at all feet was aching. I stand on my feet all day at work and I had to switch shoes at the 3rd hours. My Bf used his to go workout out and he like them for that still not as comfortable as we thought but working out in a gym for a lil while they are ok, as for working these shoes are a no go. Also, order your normal shoe size.",2,0,28
"First shoes are true to size, I order a 13 and they fit perfectly. 2nd, not only does these shoes look good they feel good and the support is good, plus if they are good outfit shoes. Went walking 5 miles and no problem. Getting ready to buy other colors. 2üëçup!!!",5,1,28
"It's a nice shoe however, it does not have arch support so running and/or walking in then made my feet hurt. Personally, wouldn't recommend.",1,0,28
"These shoes have no cushion. Feels like I was wearing 2x4's on my feet. Nice looking, but not practical for actually wearing or working out.",2,0,28
My son is into expensive 200.00 shoes but wanted to try these. He loves these more than the ones I paid waaay more for. Is made a bit more for a skinnier foot but they do stretch.,5,1,28
"I wasn‚Äôt real thrilled with these shoes. They are oddly shaped and clunky. When I walked in them on laminate flooring, I felt off balance. The inside of the shoe was pretty soft, but they just never felt right to me.",2,0,28
I was looking for some k Swiss tubes running shoes and these were the closest shoe I could find as the tubes aren‚Äôt avail any more. They are Great! They cushion the shock in walking just like the k Swiss tubes did! I am very pleased with these! They look cool and do what I wanted!,5,1,28
The shoe looks nice is the first thing I noticed but picking them up they are heavy. I did not expect that. Comfort wise they‚Äôre a 5 out of 10. I wouldn‚Äôt buy again. They‚Äôre stiff even after wearing several weeks. I‚Äôd never go to an all day event with these. Short term they‚Äôre fine. For the price they‚Äôre ok but not for long walks. No way.,3,0,28
"I loved the style. These shoes are the best looking tennis shoes I have ever seen. The price is, in my opinion, great! The fit was perfect however, the comfort wasn't what I needed. They felt quite rigid and stiff. I really wanted them to feel as good as they look, but for my old feet comfort is more important than looks.",2,0,28
I freaking love these shoes! I‚Äôm a 9 1/2 in women so I tippy toed to the men‚Äôs section and snagged a size 8! Works perfectly ‚Ä¶ bought 2 in the same color. Worth every cent!!!,5,1,28
Sole appears to be impact absorbing material but is in fact hard plastic. Not flexible and would be terrible for working out. Not a quality product. You get what you pay for.,2,0,28
"I love these shoes, my man loves these shoes too, we both have three pair a piece. They are very comfortable, breathable, and you can walk long walks without cramping feet. Most of all I like how I wear no socks and feet don't sweat.",5,1,28
"Mala calidad, se despeg√≥ parte de la suela el primer d√≠a de uso. No la devuelvo, por la complicaci√≥n de tener que pagar costes antes de que me reembolsen el dinero, y por que a mi hijo le siguen gustando. Pero no pienso volver a comprar mas productos si no cambian su pol√≠tica de devoluciones.",1,0,28
Usually wear a 10.5 but bought 11 and were way too big so probably some 10s would fit perfect. They a little heavy compare so some nikes I have.,4,1,28
"I purchased a size 13 men‚Äôs shoe for my husband for Christmas. He thought that the size would be too big but they actually fit well with a pair of socks. He liked the look so, I ordered him a second pair and it arrived on time. I wear a women‚Äôs size 9 but I ordered a size 7 in men‚Äôs and they fit well. I love the sole padding material inside the bottom of the shoe because my feet are narrow. I can walk in them all day without any discomfort. I will be ordering more colors!",5,1,28
"I think these are Nike's ripoffs BUUUT! They are GREAT quality ripoffs! 10/10! Comfy, durable and great for working out and running!",5,1,28
I purchased these and figures ide give them a try. Pretty average quality and pretty comfortable. Ide definitely buy them again. They seem to be holding up very well!,5,1,28
The shoes are way to tight and uncomfortable. Yes the writing looks cool but the shoes are a joke for comfort.,1,0,28
Purchased these for style and comfort. I wear 10/11 in women‚Äôs so I ordered a 9 men‚Äôs. Next pair will be an 8 or 8.5. Nevertheless the red color is poppin and they are quite comfy.,5,1,28
So far they are awesome. After a week they are holding up well. They turn heads and get lots of comments. Definitely will buy another pair or two.,5,1,28
These sneakers are so comfortable I brought every color in men‚Äôs and my granddaughter in woman‚Äôs true to size. It feels like you are walking on a foam mat while on concrete. I need a total knee replacement and these sneakers gave me relief on my knee with my brace on. Other sneakers did not give me the support or relief.,5,1,28
"I was looking for a cheap/decent new pair of shoes for running errands and going to the gym. These are not too bad for their price. They ran a little big, but not enough to where I wanted to return them. They are also a little wide, but again, nothing severe. They took a few day to get used to, but they‚Äôre pretty comfortable and I can wear them all day without any pains. Would buy again.",4,1,28
"CAME RIGHT ON TIME, AND MY SON ALWAYS HAS A HARD TIME FINDING SHOES THAT ARE COMFORTABLE WITH SUPPORT TO KEEP HIS FEET PROTECTED FROM ALL DAY WALKING ACHE AND PAINS, THESE WERE ABOVE THEIR EXPECTATIONS, THEY FIT PERFECT!",5,1,28
"They are light weight and comfortable, everyone who‚Äôs seen them were immediately asking what they are and how nice they are",5,1,28
Terrible sneaker made with cheap materials. The rubber at the bottom started to rip the first day I went running with it.,1,0,28
The shoes were great for the 1st couple times are used them to workout but the 3rd and 4th time I wore them they did not have any support and caused me to have major shin splints.,1,0,28
Not recommended if you are on your feet long periods. I purchased for work and being on my feet 40hrs a week they did not feel comfortable after a while. I would wear them if only wearing short period of times.,4,1,28
I haven‚Äôt had a chance to wear them yet but have tried them on. They fit well and are true to size. They feel very comfortable and seem like they will hold up well as I have purchased a pair before.,4,1,28
"While these shoes are not name brand shoes they fit better than any of my Nikes, Pumas, Adidas or New Balances. Definitely worth a try and at this price, you don‚Äôt have much to lose! Walking on clouds......",5,1,28
These shoes are stupid fly and comfortable. I don't work out in them but they feel like they could stand that test too.,5,1,28
"Very nice and comfortable and I get tons of ‚Äú I like your shoes ‚Äú from co-workers and neighbors etc.

I wear size 9 US men‚Äôs , but I reordered size 8 1/2
And the fit perfect. The size 9 was too big for me.

I suggest 1/2 size smaller when ordering. But the refund and reorder was very fast.

I reordered the 8.5 size and took back the size 9 to kohl‚Äôs authorized return location, and that was very easy and quickly process.",5,1,28
"These are great shoes and very comfortable. They seem to run a little big however. I usually wear a 10.5""-11"" and that's what I ordered but feels just a little big... not too much though. I'd say fairly true to size.",5,1,28
I bought theses shoes 6 months ago for my daily walking. The shoes didn't last six months. The outer sole is completely worn off and my inner sole is also torn. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for people who want to use these for workouts and running. Total waste of money.,1,0,28
"so... ive been walking 12 miles a night working at this exact place i ordered
i ""pick'"" about 100 of these shoes in 12 hours
so i bought them myself and i can say from working and walking 15,000 steps a night @ 10 miles a shift
my feet are feeling like they can make it...
the shoes have ""pillows for your toes lol """,5,1,28
"I like the style and fit of these sneakers also the price was right, my only thing is the soles (bottom rubber) looks a little thin, so I dont know how long will these sneakers will last with everyday use!",4,1,28
"Compre 9 pares de estos tenis. 4 llegaron bien con el n√∫mero que ped√≠ , otros 5 llegaron m√°s peque√±os. Lo peor es que todos vinieron en el mismo paquete. Es como el vendedor lo hubiese echo a prop√≥sito porque no ten√≠a todos con mi n√∫mero y lo hace para que al final me quede con ellos y no los devuelva. En fin , una raz√≥n m√°s para no comprar ropa en Amazon. Muy decepcionado.",1,0,28
Came very quick. This is my 2nd pair. They run big so a got 1 size smaller. Everyone at my Job loved to see them. I work on my feet all day and they feel great.,5,1,28
I like the padding on the inside of the shoes. They are so comfortable and gives me good support for my knees. I love the variety of colors. I had to order the men's shoes because I wear a size 12 women's and they don't carry that size and that's the only downside for me. True fit great price.,5,1,28
Hard plastic presses into center of ball of foot... not ergonomically designed.... cool color but not worth the pain. Get a decent pair of athletic shoes if you‚Äôre on your feet all day.,2,0,28
The first pair fit great. The other 3 pair the right foot is a bit tight. The left foot fits perfectly. I'm not sure but I ordered 3 more pair and each right foot is bit too short. I wear an shoe 8 in women's so that's a (39uk)US in men's is a 6.5 I really like the shoes I get constant compliments.,4,1,28
"I ordered 3 pairs of these shoes for myself, 1 for my bestie and 1 for my daughter. all of them fit well except these green ones for my daughter. I ordered a ladies 7 and that is not what she got.... they look like clown shoes on her feet. she lives in another state and doesn't drive. I need to return them and get the right size but I live in Mississippi and she's in Minnesota....",3,0,28
Letters will start to peel after a few weeks of use but looks cool.. Lol cool though and gets a lot of attention,3,0,28
Great shoes for my running needs(not a great runner just about 2 miles a day) very comfortable and light,5,1,28
"I work in housekeeping at a hospital and we're told by a few associates that these shoes are good shoes. I got a pair and they aren't very comfortable, they feel tight, the padding is thin inside the sole and if I walk over a wet floor I slide and almost fall on my ass. At the end of the first day, both my feet hurt and I was pissed. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE SHOES!!!!",1,0,28
"looks good when you look at it at first. I wore this for A month, and already 30% of anti slip rubbers at the bottom of shoe are gone :( NOT GOOD",1,0,28
Right in front of your heel the shoe is too narrow and the arch inside presses against the sides of your feet and makes them hurt,3,0,28
"I never leave negative reviews but I have to with these. It looks like the webbing on the bottom is springy. I can assure you it isn‚Äôt. Wooden clogs would give more bounce in your step. The shoe is built weird so it feels like your foot isn‚Äôt secure. They‚Äôre cheap, so I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything out of this world but don‚Äôt buy these to save money. I immediately went to a Nike outlet after wearing them for 5 minutes.",1,0,28
"Prepare to be disappointed.
Pros: Lightweight
Look Good!
Cons: One month shipping?
Zero run capability
Flat Arch
Worst Shoe I've ever purchased
Cheap feel",1,0,28
"Shoes fit really good but not great. I always wear a 13 and if they made 13.5 they would be perfect. But overall, good shoes for the price.",4,1,28
"Read some reviews, they looked pretty good, bought them, did not fit my feet properly, but I do have a bit of a higher arch than most people, all in all a decent shoe, but I probably would not purchase again due to they did not fit my comfort level. I‚Äôm on my feet 12 to 16 hours a day, and they did not really help with the foot pain. But try for yourself. Maybe they fit you better. But for the price range, they are absolutely phenomenal.",3,0,28
Thought it would be more cushion also when I walk the shoes make a sound as if I walked in water but didn‚Äôt. Very embarrassing.,3,0,28
"Ordered next size up based on reviews. Initially they felt great but, after about 4-5 hours they stretched out and were loose. They still are a great deal and neat looking shoe for the price.",5,1,28
"honestly when I took these out the plastic my exact words were ""ugh these look too big"" but then when I put them on i fell in love. They're very comfy and love the style. I will be getting g different colors too",4,1,28
"I bought these shoes after my daughter bought hers, mainly for walking around car shows and events as my feet get so hot on the pavement. I love that the shoes are breathable, but my foot is rather narrow and the shoe bunches when I tie them. I still wear them because they are comfortable and breathable.
Will most likely order them in a different color and maybe a different size to see if that makes a difference?",5,1,28
"I got this tennis for my vacations, since i will be walking for hours, but i wanted to give them a try before, just to make sure they wont make my feet stink or anything weird.

im so happy, they are comfy, and they do absorb the impact, feel like walking on memory foam",5,1,28
"I love these shoes. I ordered another pair. They are cute and stylish, but most important they are very comfortable to your feet. My knees hurt a lot when I walk, but when I wear these shoes, I do not hurt as much. The only problem I am having is they are all starting to squeak when I walk .",5,1,28
"The shoe is dope, but the company should consider wide options. The shoot hurt my feet horribly.",4,1,28
Fit a little snug but I have wide feet. Overall great shoes I walk around ten miles a day for work and haven‚Äôt had any problems with them definitely comfortable for long shifts and the soles seem like they should last a good amount of time,5,1,28
I get compliments all the time. These are very comfortable shoes and easy to get in and out of.,5,1,28
My husband loves those shoes and already wants another pair. Everybody compliments him and thinks his shoes are name brand. Very good value for this pair of shoes. The color is beautiful and they have a modern design. They also fit true to size.,5,1,28
I brought these because my son is very hard on his clothes and shoes. These are at a great price and the look better than some of the name brand big balling shoes that he scuffs up in days! They fit as expected! Awesome product I will be buying again,5,1,28
I love the look and feel. Its light weight and very comfortable. I definitely love the fact that the heal portion of the shoe doesn't have whatever kind of material (cardboard) that all shoe makers use that the one time you try to slip on the shoe without undoing shoe laces deforms the heal portion of the shoe and it makes it bothersome thereafter. Very affordable and comfortable. Definitely recommend it!,5,1,28
I was very concerned about purchasing shows online! I'm very pleased with my purchase! I will buy some other colors!,5,1,28
"They came drink wrapped wich caused the toe area to had dents,I had to stuff them for about a week, no insoles provided, no arch support some thread in the tongue area are loss and getting worse",1,0,28
No arch support. Cheap materials. No cushioning so you feel the hard soles on the sides of your feet. I gave it an extra star becsuse they look good. They only cost $32 but still think they're not worth it. Too bad because they do look cool.,2,0,28
The price combined with the look make for a overall decent item. Very happy with my purchase.,4,1,28
I ordered my size but shoes were too big. While I did try them on they were comfortable. They run big in size. Atleast a half size too large. Had to send back.,3,0,28
Purchased 5 pairs of these sneakers .... will purchase 4 more in the future .... my nephew just purchased 2 pairs of these sneakers yesterday. You will love these sneakers just as I do.,5,1,28
"Cheaply made. I bought the pair hoping to use them for running. Used them once and swore never to use them again.
After a mile I could feel the lumps of the sole pretty much against my foot.
Basically it's like your foot was directly in contact with the hard sole with no cushioning.
After 2 miles I couldn't run in them no more and had to cut my run short for fear of injury.",1,0,28
"This is a very beautiful and comfortable shoe . Being on my feet at work most of my shift, the feel and support is great.",5,1,28
"Between my wife and I we have purchased 3 pairs of these all 3 pairs the sole has either fallen off in pieces or wore off in just a couple months, they don‚Äôt last at all, we wear them for just regular use , walking around that‚Äôs all , poor quality of plastic sole material.",1,0,28
"I have wide feet but these did fit fine. However the insoles are trash so I bought some Dr. Scholl's inserts.
This helps considerably on my lower back for my weight. I would recommend getting supportive insoles for these shoes. A must.",3,0,28
I wear a size 9 - 9.5 depending on brand. Order a size 9 and shoes are way too big. Gotta be 2 sizes over labeled.,2,0,28
They are pretty comfortable but a little heavy. There is a raised pattern on the interior ball of the shoe that is annoying. Inserts fix that issue. I like the color and durability.,3,0,28
 I love the look and comfort. The only thing I don't like is they squeak when I walk.,4,1,28
My son ordered these to play baseball on turf and loves them. They were comfortable on the first day and a great price.,5,1,28
"Have had these about a month now. Was skeptical because if the great price, but have been pleased with the comfort so far. I walk on concrete all day at work and go through shoes about 2-3 times per year. Even if these only last 4 months, the price is right.",4,1,28
"Nice shoe at great price. Had a little less bounce then expected (I own several adidas boost shoes),when they said like walking on clouds it doesn't quite meet that comparison ( not many shoes do), but it is quite comfortable!",4,1,28
Soles came apart less than a week. I have a 8 hr sit down job and when they get wet the whole office can hear the squeaks.,1,0,28
My son loves these shoes.He gets a lot of compliments on them at school.May get another color later on!,5,1,28
"Surprisingly comfortable and stylish. I was skeptical, but many people were raving about them. The padding in the shoe is adequate, not over padded, but still comfortable. I will see once I get a chance to work out if they hold up well. Over all very pleased, especially for the low price offered",4,1,28
"These were not very comfortable at all, these were really tight for me, also had my feet hurting after only a few hours of wearing them. I love the look, but wouldn‚Äôt buy these again.",2,0,28
The shoe is terrible with the insoles they come with. Its like walking on an asphalt street with no socks and shoes. If you have some custom insoles and if you place them in the shoe than its really comfy. The insoles i have is what makes it comfy but the shoe itself just looks cool and thats about it. If you work 12 hour shifts i would invest somewhere else.,2,0,28
 These shoes are junk when the lettering gets wet it falls off the shoes! I have had these for about 3 weeks there garbage don‚Äôt waste your money the whole reason I bought the shoes was because of the lettering on the sides. #Trash,1,0,28
"Shoes are very comfortable. They didn't have 8.5 in any color so I went with an 8. A little snug, can't wear socks with them.",4,1,28
The rubber on the bottom of the shoe stared coming off the second day I wore these after the third day forget any grip it was all falling apart,3,0,28
"Very, very hard to get on. If I were to order again I would order a size larger for that reason only. I have only worn the shoes for three days in dry weather, but they track in dirt hidden in the grid work. Mud?",3,0,28
These shoes are horrible the soles are all uneven on the inside. Very uncomfortable,1,0,28
"The shoes are clearly a cheap knock off of nike ""Just Do It"" But its ""just so so"" . That's actually the writing on the side of the shoe.... Just So So. When you wear them you feel like if you don't take them off, they are going to disfigure you.",1,0,28
"I‚Äôm a nurse and I get a comment from everyone on how great they look!!!!! Great conversation starter with these shoes. Took 3 weeks for them to finally feel comfortable, but worth it. My feet do not hurt after a 13 hour shift.",5,1,28
This is my second pair love love love these! Only problem is that they are not good for running. But they are great for everything else.,5,1,28
"Initially these shoes were great. A little stiff, but they broke in well. It‚Äôs been a month and a half and the sole of the shoe is already separating from the shoe itself. They‚Äôve only been used for walking, nothing strenuous at all. Disappointed and now it‚Äôs too late for a return.",2,0,28
"They say it right on the shoe. Just so so. They run a little large, and seem ok for my uses (basement weight lifting workouts). But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd run in these or anything of that ilk.",4,1,28
I‚Äôm size 9 and usually buy 9.5 since I don‚Äôt like it too snug. These tennis shoes don‚Äôt come in 9.5 but their 9 are perfect for me. Great for the money. Great for the gym.,5,1,28
Feels like my feet aren‚Äôt touching the ground! They are that comfortable! Bought several pair.,5,1,28
I love these shoes they are very comfortable and look super slim on my feet. Really match with my style and a lot of people are always complimenting me on them too. I would highly recommend getting a pair!!,5,1,28
I get plenty of stares and comments wearing these. Their definitely eye catchers. No shipping charges and these things shipped from California to Delaware in just over 24 hrs from ordering! UNBELIEVABLY FAST SHIPPING!! Just ordered two more pair,5,1,28
I liked the look of this product. The sole on the nottom is no good. It's very slippery on certain floor types. The rubber on the bottom has started to come off. I would not recommend it.,2,0,28
"So I bought these shoes because a coworker gave me a good review on them. So I Wore 2 days to break them in‚Ä¶. The letters on the shoe we‚Äôre coming off, the lace is un reviling. They are only comfortable for a couple hours, after that your feet become sore. Will not be purchasing this shoe or brand again.",1,0,28
The opening for the foot is to small. Only has 4 inches to put your foot in. Really not easy to fit your foot in. Also the fabric is really course.,2,0,28
The shoe has cushion but it isn't for long wear or running in. Fits great and looks like the picture but the strap on the back is too lose or big. I like it though.,4,1,28
Caused blisters after first day,2,0,28
These shoes look great and feel great. My feet got a bit sore from lots of walking but nothing a comfort insole wouldn‚Äôt fix. Worth the money.,5,1,28
"This shoe kills your feet. Just so so hurt your feet So So Bad !! They look comfortable! But are far from it. If your going to purchase these shoes. I suggest you get two sizes larger (I know right !?! And stuff the shoe with as much cushion as you can. Other wise just stay away from them. But on the plus side, they do look super cool. I wanted them to be my number one walking shoe.",2,0,28
"Good to slip on easy, but very little side support. The pad foot pad wears through quickly and you feel the bottom of the shoe when you walk.",3,0,28
"Not incredibly comfortable
And the rubber on the body came detached with in a month of average use.",3,0,28
The sole of this shoe is so hard and not comfortable at all! Bought inter soles and still not comfortable for walking! Would not buy again.,3,0,28
I purchased these shoes because they looked like they would have a lot of cushion/bounce but they don't. They are also super heavy.,2,0,28
I purchased this shoe for the sole purpose of running in them. Running was way too uncomfortable during my 2.25 mile-run. I think this shoe works best as a walking shoe and/or possibly a weight-lifting shoe. It's not a running shoe! It is very comfortable though and fits well.,3,0,28
"For the $$$ this is a great fashion sneaker, I wouldn't wear them to run in, but these are great for just hanging out in. Good looking shoe, comfortable easy to wear. I would buy them again. Thanks Amazon",5,1,28
"The shoes are too large, really can‚Äôt give a review because I have to send them back. The company shoe size comes in Eurasia size, hopefully you know how that works",1,0,28
"Size was true in length, I wish I could order them in a wider size though. Ran a 5k today in them and they had good support aka good bounce.",4,1,28
These shoes are terrible. The soles are very hard which hurts my arches when I ran in them. These are definitely not for working out.,1,0,28
This shoes are ok to workout in but not great to wear for standing in for 8hrs if you have flat feet,5,1,28
"I'll start by saying I like the shoe. I wear it more as a fashion shoe. This is what concerns me. The soul detached from the bottom. Also, one of the shoelace straps broke. Doesn't stop me from wearing them. I'm just concerned about quality. I will try another pair and consider the first a fluke",4,1,28
They were way too narrow. I never saw a choice of widths. My feet are not unusually wide. With some shoes I have to have 10W and other a 10 is fine.,3,0,28
Husband loves these shoes. Stylish and comfortable. Gets compliments on them all the time and he wears them all the time,5,1,28
"Fast delivery, comfortable fit and stylish. Never heard of this brand, but as good as the quality is, they'll blow up big time. I love em and will order more.",5,1,28
No Dislike But Everyone Like The Shoes And This Color My Coworkers Wanted To Take Them From Me,5,1,28
Fit great but not made for all day. After 4 hours they killed my feet. Tried new insoles but it caused the shoes to be to snug and uncomfortable. If they were made in wide they would fit great and would probably give more room for replacement insoles with more support,4,1,28
I'm so sad these shoes are made so crappy! The fit is amazing and comfortable but they lasted 1 month!! We got them mid Feb and today is March 29. The writing peeled off and the soles are pealing off now!! I got 2 pairs one for my son and myself. Both pairs doing the exact same. Tried to message the company directly. No response. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Pictures show my shoes and my son's both.,1,0,28
"I have these in red, orange, pink, and yellow! Love love love them. I plan on purchasing every single color",5,1,28
"Honestly, I have never had so many compliments on shoes especially under $50.00. They fit snug. I wear 9.5 but ordered 10.0 because of a wide foot. Very comfortable. Not feather light like Onn but for 1/3 of the price I cannot tell.",5,1,28
The only thing I don't like is the lettering is coming off after 2 weeks of wear. But the shoe itself is very comfortable and well made. would recommend for people who have sore feet.,4,1,28
"Shoes are very comfortable, I don‚Äôt work out however I have received many compliments on these shoes.",5,1,28
I've ordered 4 pair of these and this pair were to big. My fault because I typed in women's so so shoes and the men's piped up I clicked the size and bought so it's website error and mine. But I gave them to my dad and he loves them,1,0,28
Great shoe and design...the flap is built on and make for ease of shoe access. The opening is a bit longer than needs to be but overall great shoe for the price,4,1,28
Could do with a little less flash. Black on black ink would be great! Would definitely purchase another pair,5,1,28
Best shoes for the money. Good padding and very comfortable with high quality materials,5,1,28
Feels like a cloud. Love the form fitting insoles. Really cute and comfortable to boot! A+++,5,1,28
They look cute but they need to be broke in. Not completely as comfortable as I thought.,4,1,28
Husband bought these and they hurt his feet. He can only wear them for short periods of time! Bought these for him because everyone said they were super comfortable,1,0,28
Hi. Seem this shoe and the color. I had to have it. I ordered a 12 cause they didn't have 11.5. It's a little roomier them I wanted...but all n all. The color and shoe is great.,5,1,28
 Hadn‚Äôt had these long. Wore the shoes 3 times and they are already falling apart. Would like an exchange or refund.,1,0,28
"I only wear these for work , I work 12 hours and my feel feel amazing after a long shift but I just dislike hat they squeak when I walk . Everybody knows when I‚Äôm coming lol but besides that the shoe fits as expected",4,1,28
Love these shoes! Got so many compliments on them. The best thing is the comfort. The color is amazing. Nice and vibrant!,5,1,28
Many people ask where I get them from and what not love these shoes especially for the gym or comfort does the job,5,1,28
"These are no joke, the best shoes I have ever owned. Coworkers are asking where I got them and want to buy them. In fact... I'm buying my third pair now. lol (My daughter got a pair and I want a set for just exercise.)",5,1,28
Good for weights and basic work. I wouldn't want to run in them but they look super cool and feel nice enough,4,1,28
Very comfortable shoe and great price point. Does make noise on fake floor.,5,1,28
It is good for 5 months ONLY...and stars falling a part..piece by piece,1,0,28
they are very comfortable very good design but after a month of using them the sole came off very cheap material,1,0,28
"Love the color, look and feel. But the shoe is bunched up where the shoelaces are and looked silly. No other shoe I have does this. Wont be ordering other colors just bc of that fact.",3,0,28
They are NOT light. A lot heavier then most training shoes. On the other hand very durable.,3,0,28
Colors are awesome. I love these shoes. I receive multiple complements. After about 6 months I am now needing to purchase insoles.,5,1,28
"These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever had. They're stylish, durable, and eye catchers.",5,1,28
I've had many comments from my colleagues and friends on how stylish and cool they look. They are comfortable and supportive. I wear a 10 and ordered a 10 and they fit perfect,5,1,28
"These shoes look cool and the pictures match the what you see online but ... there is always a but ... there is no interior padding and the shoes are hard as a rock. You cannot run in these shoes - you can barely walk around in these shoes. If you want a running shoe, get something different.",1,0,28
I only use them to workout out and they give me enough support.,3,0,28
"So bad quality, Build Quality is to Low l, too bad is not what they say in the advertising, this is a scam. Not happy at all",1,0,28
The external proportions are too large for me. Gave them away.,3,0,28
They look great and I was very excited to get them. I thought I had ordered women‚Äôs in a 9 however I got them in a men‚Äôs 9. I have to return for a replacement. They took a little longer than I expected.,4,1,28
"More comfortable than I thought. Easily stained due to fabric on toe but given the price, I think they are great. Terrible for running but good for normal walking.",4,1,28
"I returned them, these were not even close to a 13. These were a narrow 11 at best and super tight.",1,0,28
"I love the color I got, the shoes are comfortable and easy to get on I got 7.5 fits as an 8 . Did request return to exchange for smaller size did not get response. But I still wear them... if ordering they are about 1/2 size bigger.",4,1,28
"I like the shoes, they are a bit tight, although they may break in a bit, time will tell. For the money, it‚Äôd be hard to find a better shoe for the money.",5,1,28
I love this sneaker it's very comfortable and the fit is true to size and not heavy on your feet.,5,1,28
The look and feel good but just a little too big. I needed a 10.5 and they only carry 10 or 11 ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨,4,1,28
"Only wore a month, not even every day, and the sole pulled loose. Had to super glue it. They are comfortable, but not worth buying if I have to glue my shoes together.",1,0,28
I would give this a 3 and a half rating. It‚Äôs too comfortable and it doesn‚Äôt support your feet so I twist my ankles sometimes. But it‚Äôs a pretty good price overall and I would recommend it for going to the store and sometimes work. But not sports,4,1,28
"Grandson was overly thrilled, now he wants more colors. He walks on his toes and these have the support he needs.",5,1,28
"Bought these shoes for my husband to use at work. They are really heavy for a ‚Äòrunning shoe‚Äô the sole has already fallen apart. He said they had decent arch support and looked great, but the wearability was much less than expected. If you don‚Äôt wear them to work in, they should be fine.",1,0,28
"I only have like markings as they are not comfortable wearing in a factory, on your feet for 10 hrs a day.",3,0,28
They are better than I thought. Comfortable enough I can wear all day without my feet hurting,5,1,28
"Hard to insert feet / the opening is difficult. The sole is too hard, not for running/exercise.",3,0,28
"Gave it one star because when I tried tightening the laces, the lace ripped the eyelet! Cheap made, not worth the money or the wait!",1,0,28
Nicely made but not enough cushion to compensate for the impact while running. Made for walking and not for running.,5,1,28
Very pleased with my purchase. They are very comfortable and I'm on my feet almost all day. I'm a heavy girl and I get the perfect support on my feet with these.,5,1,28
"This product is great.. My son loves this shoes.. Its comfortable, its supports your arch as well..",5,1,28
"Comfortable shoe, but doesn‚Äôt support your ankles very well",5,1,28
"He loved everything about the shoe from the design, to how it fit, and everything else except that when you go outside in the sun, the shoe gives off an orange red look. Not red red like it‚Äôs advertised.",5,1,28
"Junk,,
Got them wet and then had to throw them in the trash‚Ä¶ They are like the witch on wizard of Oz they melted",1,0,28
Been using it for couple of months. I have been walking an average of 3 to 4 miles. It‚Äôs comfy,5,1,28
Very comfortable shoes. The soles are plastic so somewhat squeaky but other than that no complaints.,5,1,28
"Pretty good. Not great for flat feet, there are no arch supports. Overall i like them.",5,1,28
Comfortable shoe. I deal with diabetic neuropathy and finding comfort has been challenging - until now. Love these,5,1,28
"The insole wears out fast, goes from being cushiony to flat in about 10 mins of wear. Really heavy and uncomfortable to workout in, they look stylish though.",3,0,28
opening for foot was not big enough to fit my size 13 in the shoe. could barely get past the ball of my foot. very frustrating.,3,0,28
Ordered them so i could walk comfortably in out trip to NewYork and it was great.,5,1,28
My husband love them very comfortable fit to his flat feet. He recommend to our niece and she brought her a couple pair.,5,1,28
Have you seen the Spongebob episode with the rubber boots? Well imagine that but with a megaphone. I squeaked for an week until I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. These shoes were stylish and comfortable but I couldn‚Äôt get past the constant noise,1,0,28
"The color is great! Makes a statement just like I wanted. The comfort was a little off at first, but it just took time to get used to it. Now that I've worn them a few times, they feel good.",5,1,28
"I love these shoes, they‚Äôre so light and comfortable. The price is unbeatable and they feel and look good, very similar to higher end brands that 3-4x the price. I got the white and they look amazing with everything.

The only downside is they seem to run about half a size small, even with a thin sock. I wear a 8.5 and it‚Äôs consistent in 95% of shoe brands I‚Äôve bought. I could have definitely sized up to a 9. I‚Äôll be getting more colors in half a size up though, definitely worth it.",4,1,28
"This is the second pair of these that I purchased. My son wanted a pair after he saw mine. These are a good casual shoe or for walking. Don't expect to play sports in these where you need to make quick movements...the structure of the shoe isn't built for that. The insole could be better but for the price, these are a very nice shoe.
These have lasted my son a while considering how hard he is on shoes. I would purchase them again (for me or him).",4,1,28
"Got these shoes for some easy hiking in parks and I pretty like it so far. I‚Äôve had these running shoes for a week and have already pit around 8 miles in them, and they still look and feel like new. Would recommend",5,1,28
"I want to preface this with saying that they met my needs perfectly for what I bought them for- cheap running shoes to use on a treadmill.

Overall these shoes are a good value for the price, but I wouldn't recommend for more intensive use.
Pros:
-Super easy to wear: The elastic form means you can slip them on while still having a general form and laces to tighten them.
-Ball of the foot support: These things support the front of your foot surprisingly well. If you're doing a lot of your movement that focuses on the balls of your feet these will work well.
-Fine sole: Nothing to write home about but it does its job well and is sturdy and doesn't slip on surfaces.

Cons:
-Lack of support: As a result of the following reasons I would never use these in more intensive running as I would worry about my feet rolling or losing my grip.
-Heel slippage: Due to the elastic nature of the shoe my heels are always sliding around, moreso toward the middle. I imagine this could be fixed by a third party insole but at that point you might as well spend your money on a better shoe.
-Inner arch support: Same thing as above, it doesn't provide much support and as someone with flat feet I could feel my feet wanting to roll.
-Lack of shock absorption: The insoles provided and the soles don't do much for real running/jogging environments. They feel fine on a treadmill but jogging in a park or hiking I could feel my feet getting sore minutes in.

Overall they're fine for the price point and if you need a casual stopgap pair of shoes, but do not buy these as your primary pair of shoes. Even if you're just doing lots of walking I could see them causing issues down the line.",3,0,28
"On time, comfortable, correct size and acceptably priced. Quality to be determined but appears to be good. Would buy again. Insoles were better than expected. However I would not work 8 or more hours a day in them without first getting aftermarket insoles. Perfect for casual use or maybe some light walks, jogs, etc.

UPDATE: have been wearing these daily now for more than a month. Quality still Seems great! However the vinyl ‚Äúbranding label‚Äù in the heel, on the insole was squeaking against my socks, if the humidity inside the shoes increased. However the label seems to be wearing off and the squeaking is going away.
I can see how that squeaking could be a problem for people.",5,1,28
I normally wear 10.5. I got 10.5. Shoes were too tight in the toe (width area) for comfort. The worse thing to me was how short and loose the heel area was. They were sliding up and down the back of heel. Trash. It's a real shame because I like the way these shoes look. They are very light-weight and the soles felt like they had a lot of cushiony support. I actually tend not to like that because it throws my balance off. Feels kinda like I'm wearing high-heel shoes...I image. I've never worn high-heels :),1,0,28
"So I ordered these along with an olive green hat and some camo cargo shorts for one of the outfits to wear out on a weekend.

The shoes feel REALLY comfortable and I happen to not feel any foot pain at all throughout my day. The color was actually close to just about everything else I wore and the laces stayed fairly tight through the day as well.

The only downside I had was that there was too much toe room. I wear an 11.5 in Nike and Adidas. All other shoes I either have to size up or size down. This is one of the ones I‚Äôll need to size down by a 1/2 size.

Other than that, I would recommend these shoes as there aren‚Äôt much of an advertisement and there are PLENTY of colors to go with outfits.",5,1,28
"Do not recommend buying. The shoes Barry come in any packaging, just in a bag. The quality isn‚Äôt great even if it isn‚Äôt expensive they should still be able to get a cleaned up finished product. Mine came with plenty of glue dried up on the shoe and even after cleanup there is still a lot left",1,0,28
"These are nice shoes for the price. But I bought them for daily walks of 3+ miles. Unfortunately, they aren‚Äôt comfortable nor supportive enough, and I returned them. I‚Äôll stick with my preferred brand, ASICS. IMO, the higher price for the name brand walking/running shoes is worth it for better support.",3,0,28
"I'd really like to return these because they are too narrow for my feet. My return window already closed, since when is there only a 30 day return window!?
-customer service allowed a chat to do a return.
They're good and cheap enough for what I need them for (school clinicals). They are a NARROW fit kind of like Nikes so if you have a wider foot like myself these aren't going to be the best fit for you, but I love how they just slip on, prob the best feature of the shoe.",3,0,28
"Nice looking shoe. I would definitely not use for running, but it is just fine for walking and I use them for golfing. Very comfortable and provide sufficient grip - about same as spikeless golf shoes. Maybe not for wet weather golf.

Cannot comment on durability at this point.",5,1,28
"I liked the design colors, and the overall comfort, but they will be tight across the instep for anyone with a high arch. And they seem to run a little small - unless you wear them without sox.
However, they can be broken in by using shoe-trees.",5,1,28
"These are just perfect! Got the loop on the back to slide these on! I can run, walk, they are easy to clean and the memory foam is good. I am single mom that don‚Äôt splurge in myself but I totally feel like I did here. Great alternative to more expensive shoes!",4,1,28
"About 3 weeks in, rather like these new shoes. They're padded, they're seemingly durable and can comfort my feet as I travel around the region. Certainly a step up without blowing the bank.",5,1,28
"After reading the reviews, I decided to give these guys a try. Fitment is good and price was great. It is a good walk shoe, but I'd suggest to add a bit more cushion if you decided to use this as an everyday.",5,1,28
"I lost 30 pounds and counting in 2 months eating right and walking every morning in these shoes. They are a deal and give me no foot pain, unlike shoes that cost 3 times as much on sale. Get some if you like walking!",5,1,28
Replaced only shoes. Initially the backs felt weird but once I broke them in overall they're great. Comfortable and works well for long distances walking.,5,1,28
"This was a good purchase. They are very comfortable and lightweight. I wear size 8, but based on the reviews got an 8.5. It was still a little bit tight. A size 9 would have been better.",5,1,28
Have had them for a couple weeks now and man for the price they are excellent! It‚Äôs almost like I didn‚Äôt even need to break them in at all. They‚Äôve been comfortable since day one and are super light. Highly recommend.,5,1,28
"The description says these are slip ins, but they are tie. Misleading for sure! I should have looked closer.",3,0,28
"This pair of shoes for under $30.00?!?! If these shoes hold up at all then they are a spectacular deal! So comfortable, easy to slip on & off without feeling lose and like they may fall off & stylish. I got several compliments and inquires in the first 2 times I wore them. I will be buying more pairs in more colors!",5,1,28
Bought these for my husband. He wore them on our Disneyworld trip 10+ hours and they were comfortable,5,1,28
True to size I bought these to find an alternative to my hey dude shoes and honestly I like these a lot better. These have rubber on the bottom of the foam so they will last a lot longer than comparable brands that are only foam bottom.,5,1,28
"These are extremely comfortable shoes. I'm very happy. They are also lightweight. And even though they are all black, I doubt they get very hot even on the hottest days of summer because they have so much mesh which makes them breathable. And for the low price you really can't go wrong with these.",5,1,28
"At first I was like ""ehh.."" because of the odd design but once I started wear them, I noticed how comfortable they were. Very good casual sneakers for the price.",5,1,28
These shoes are fitting perfect and comfortable for work. I love it. Thank you so much!,5,1,28
"I'm surprised at how comfortable they are for how affordable they are you're not going to last you a lifetime but they should be okay For walking or light jogging but I wouldn't recommend for heavy sports or lifting. Very breathable. Takes a day to break in the shape of your foot,",5,1,28
Ill give it a 5 star overall !!!!,5,1,28
Fit petfectly.. make sure you know your size before order,5,1,28
"Perfect for quick put on shoes, very grippy as well",5,1,28
Very comfortable and stylish. Wear these to work everyday and I really like them. I will say that be careful with sizing as I wear a 9.5 and got these in a 10 and they still feel a little tight but other than that no complaints.,5,1,28
Comfortable for walking but not a lot of support.,4,1,28
Muy buen producto relaci√≥n precio-calidad. Los tenis muy c√≥modos y llegaron c√≥mo se ven en la foto.,5,1,28

I love these shoes. I wear them for work,5,1,28
"Overall, good value for the money. The sole material could have better integrity. Fit is good and the shoes handles my special inserts very well.",4,1,28
I wanted a nice pair of shoes for my nightly walks and these are perfect. I wear a women‚Äôs size 10 and bought these in men‚Äôs size 9. These fit me perfectly 10/10 would recommend!,5,1,28
Love how light weight they are and the cushion is like walking on clouds. Worth every penny when you have constant pain in your feet. Will definitely buy again.,5,1,28

Light weight and comfy,5,1,28
"These shoes are shockingly light. What is great is my husband has a wide foot and these shoes give a generous width so he was happy. They are very flexible and seem to breathe well. They do not have a tongue, they are slip-ons, so you do not have to worry about the tongue flopping around or having to line it up. He said they would be good for walking, gardening, or light athletics. The color and design is nice. For the money, they were a great addition! :)",4,1,28
Nice fitting lightweight workout shoes. Great value compared to lather brand like models. Super comfy.,5,1,28
Awesome product,5,1,28
"I love how it was described. It was comfortable for a walk, but never use this for contact sports. This is meant for casual walk or run.",5,1,28
These are really comfortable and a great fit! I love these for working out and going on walks! I really love the look as well!,5,1,28

"These shoes are perfect for your daily use, have a good grip and casual look that goes with your daily outfit. I ordered them to use as a backup for my daily use, and they fit the purpose perfectly. I loved the design, shape, and color. The only concern is the grip, it could have been better.",4,1,28
"First off, these shoes are insanely comfortable, and fit perfectly. However, the ""bubble"" traction pattern on the bottom of the shoe makes a loud snap / pop when you walk, at literally the volume of popping bubble packaging. Numerous people have commented on this, it's completely unmistakable. This goes for nearly all surfaces. Really odd design choice, or maybe it was just my size (12.5).",2,0,28
"I‚Äôm not a marathon runner and in fact I‚Äôm far from it, run about 2 miles 4-5 days a week and was looking to replace my current new balances but wanted to try something new because all I buy are NB‚Äôs. These shoes, to me, were stunning. Minute I put them on, felt comfortable, light, but the sole is deceivingly thick. But not so much that it feels like your trucking around in some basketball shoes. These also on an aesthetic level...god do they pop. I knew they were fresh as hell the moment I put them on but I got 5 compliments the first day I wore these around just to break them in. Probably going to get another pair just for walking around. I‚Äôm not some expert runner so there may be flaws to my untrained eye but I am beyond impressed with these. I go around to different brands with different athletic gear and I always wind up in one way or another going back to Nike. They‚Äôve always had superb products and they are still at the top of their game with these shoes.",5,1,28
"I dont know if the JV in the label means something but these shoes DID NOT FIT!! I bought them for my boyfriend as a bday gift. I doubled checked his other pairs of sneakers and they all are 8.5
Shoes were too small! It hurt his toes when he tried them on. I want to return them for refund but I am not im the US at the moment and my deadline is Feb 23.",1,0,28
One shoe had a loud smack every time my son walked. Like it was suctioning down to the floor. We even put tape at the bottOm to pin point area And it continued doing it. Waiting on replacement I do not know if I will be billed twice as my son took shoes to dads house and have them a good wear down in 3 days and he never told me about problem till he was home,3,0,28
"Coming from nike air pegasus and air vomeros...which were nice, this one does not have any Nike air unit. But for casual walking the dog etc, these are perfect at 1/3 the price of the high end premium nikes. The best pro about this shoe is the nike heel lock design that was also included on the Air Vomeros...best design for the heel in my opinion(easy to slip on and stays locked down in place while running or walking). Can't wait to see what the Revolution 6 will look like.",5,1,28
"I've worn the Revolution 3,4, and 5 and, to be honest, the Revolution 3 has maintained its position as the most comfortable and best fitting of the bunch.

The Revolution 5 is extremely comfortable but seems to run a little narrow. I've waited about a week to break the shoe in and see if anything changes, but it still feels just a bit tight even with the x-wide.",4,1,28
Love! Great shoes!,5,1,28
"Quite possibly the best sneaker purchase I've made in years!!! The fit, the look, the comfortability, the support are seriously amazing. I immediately ordered two more pairs of the same model: black/white and the gray/white, which should be arriving today. The navy/white pair is next on my horizon.",5,1,28
"Absolute Garbage!! I purchased one pair and they began clicking after my first run with them. My run was on concrete only, no dirt or rocks. I returned and thought I would try them one more time. The second pair began clicking after my second short run. The click is so loud that my friend asked what that noise was when I walk. I‚Äôve seen other reviews saying the same thing.",1,0,28
"NO ONE'S FOOT IS SHAPED LIKE THIS!!! This is ridiculous! Sure, OK, the made the front section wide, but no one considered that you need to get through to middle of the shoe to put it on?",1,0,28
"I feel like I should write a formal apology to the reviewers that said this shoe is too narrow. I read it and thought ""Well I'm sure it's a bit more narrow than expected, but there's no way it's THAT bad right?"" Oh...poor naive 2020 me. Ironically as hindsight is 2020, I could not forsee how incorrect I was. The shoes arrive and I'm excited. New shoes, new me. As soon as I slid my foot in, the edge of the insole right where the arch of my foot is was jabbing into it. ""Surely it's not that bad. It's probably just the padding that needs to be shifted around"" and to my surprise, it doesn't budge. I'm throwing these on before I head to work and so I wore these devil contraptions for the day. The soles of the shoes feel much flatter than the revolution 4. I wear a wide size, but it feels like they made the fabric a bit wider, while forgetting to make the sole wider at all. This is just significantly worse than the Revolution 4. It's not as comfortable by any means. Save your money. Go buy moon shoes or something. At least those are pretty rad and will put a smile on your face.",2,0,28
"Comfortable, lightweight shoes for walking running or just relaxing.",5,1,28
The packaging was fine. They came promptly. They have a GPS tracker so I guess that‚Äôs a bonus?!? Hopefully they‚Äôre not stolen and someone won‚Äôt show up at my house. üòÇ,3,0,28
"I'm not sure why I care how my feet look as I jog past total strangers, but these Revolution 5 running shoes make me feel like I pop off the page when I pound pavement. They look so good -- so streamlined and uncluttered, with the iconic Nike swoosh, a color scheme that channels the original Air Jordan shoe, and a projection of class and timelessness in an era of obnoxiously loud shoe designs.

What I didn't expect at this low price point is a light, breathable, elite-performing running shoe: They offer the ample cushion I now need after a period of conspicuous consumption, and feel spring-loaded as they push back against the road or sidewalk. Fit is true to U.S. sizing with no sore feet in the break-in period.

An elite running shoe in every way, and the fact they're half the price of what I'm used to spending is a massive bonus. - (Was this review of use? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!)",5,1,28
"This is the second pair that I've had a problem with. The first pair I bought for my husband for Christmas. Within a couple of weeks one of the shoes started making a popping sound when he walks, like an air bubble was in the sole. We were beyond the return time, so I just bought a second. The second pair did the exact same thing. They lasted a little bit longer, but still too late to return them.",1,0,28
"After buying and returning a handful of different sneakers from Nike and New Balance, I have finally found a sneaker that is comfortable and fits my wide feet. The toe box is very large, wonderful for me especially because I have a bunion on my right foot and the extra room gives an enormous relief from the pressure. I have not found this type of width in other ""wide"" shoes and I am always on the lookout for wide shoes. I love them, thanks Nike!",5,1,28
"The popping/squeaking/clicking sound is from the cheap glue on the bottom of the thin insole. It‚Äôs still a comfortable shoe without the insole, but I just added some baby powder between the insole and inside bottom of the shoe and it got rid of the annoying popping sound.",1,0,28
"This feels like a piece of plastic, gives about the same amount of comfort as a piece of plastic. Nike should stop worrying about driving the cost down and the profits up. Nike needs to get back to making comfortable shoes that have value and comfort for the money, instead of worrying about 3D printers to make the cost of shoes even cheaper than the cheap labor they already have. This is the last pair(s) of Nike I am buying until I see a return to quality! Many of my friends feel the same way too.",2,0,28
"I bought these for my husband and he told me they‚Äôre very comfortable and good for standing in. He‚Äôs a cashier and stands in one place awhile. He said he can stand in them for hours and not have sore feet. They wouldn‚Äôt be good for using on rainy days though. I‚Äôm glad that they make wide sizes, that‚Äôs one of the reasons we bought these!",5,1,28
These have to be some of the comfiest shoes I have gotten at this price point but now comes the bad. Since the first time I took them to the gym for a run I heard a squeakiness come from them - At first I thought it was just me but it continues to happen. I wondered if it was just my sweat rubbing inside the shoe but later on found out that the rubber on the bottom was what was squeaking which happens all the time during normal use and during workouts. I used them roughly a few months before getting tired of it where the squeak drives you crazy. I‚Äôve heard this is hit and miss with this shoe but since ive had it for a while I‚Äôm just going to find new shoes. If you get a squeaky pair have them swapped ASAP as it will NOT go away.,3,0,28
"I have bought two pairs of these shoes, months apart, and the left shoe bottom for each pair squeaks all the time. Squeaks on any surface, grass, dirt, pavement, carpet. It‚Äôs freakin annoying to the point I‚Äôm ready to trash my newest pair. The squeak never goes away. Never. Feels like karma for making my kids wear squeaker shoes as toddlers. Nike has been my favorite shoe company for over 30 years, so disappointing.",1,0,28
"shoes look great regarding red on white. worried about quality in long term though. the glue and sewing / seams look cheap, discoloration on heel. i've attached a couple of photos and highlighted the issues. shoes are wide enough for me in this size so I don't have to buy wide-specific. huge problem - shoes rub against my inside ankles enough to irritate me when i first put them on. once i get running, sensation goes away. shipment arrived in poor quality - rubber bands and dented, torn box. will update review in January 2022 and revisit rating.",2,0,28
"I have always had a hard time finding shoes that are supportive for working out. I also, have wide feet and men‚Äôs shoes seem to fit me better than women‚Äôs sizes. When I was younger I injured my tailbone and hip and I have a harder time with not being in back pain when I walk long distances. I liked the look and feel of these shoes because they had a knit cloth, not the leather that pinches my feet together around my toes. When I received them, I took them on a trial and walked in the for awhile. These shoes do have some support, however, they have memory foam in them which was not supportive enough for my knees or my back.",4,1,28
"I have always been a fan of the Nike Revolution series, they were my favorite running/gym shoe. Hence, my frustration with the revolution 5.

I was severely disappointed in the pair I received. The build quality and fit and finish was absolutely terrible. There was exposed foam padding, excess, nasty, yellow/green dried adhesive all around the sole, and the back of the shoe was sewn and constructed so poorly and crookedly, it looked like it had been broken in already despite being new. To top it all off, the shoe wasn‚Äôt even clean, there was debris stuck to the sole like it had already been worn in public. These aren‚Äôt the most expensive shoes, but I expected a much better quality from something with a Nike logo.",1,0,28
The shoes arrived exactly as promised without any damage to the product. When they arrived I immediately tried them on. I was thoroughly amazed at how comfortable and lightweight the shoes were. I've had them on for more than 2 hours now and the fit and feel couldn't be better. I order my regular shoe size and they fit great. I highly recommend these to all my friends.,5,1,28
"Mine also have the loud popping sound when I walk. Super annoying. Otherwise they are comfortable, but that doesn‚Äôt matter when I can‚Äôt stand wearing them in public.",1,0,28
"I have been a lifelong Nike customer - especially for shoes. I purchased these off of amazon as a replacement to a well loved pair of old nike running shoes. I liked them because they had a lot of options in wide sizes and I really liked the black/anthracite color combo.
I wore these probably 4-5 days a week doing 4 mile walks on paved roads, and for the first 3 months of ownership they were wonderful. Fit perfect, comfortable, stylish - all that I've come to expect from Nike. However, after about the 3rd month of wearing these both shoes developed holes right at the achilles tendon and there were these razor sharp plastic pieces poking through the shoes (see pictures, hard to see, but there is a white plastic part poking through the back). This pretty quickly made these shoes unwearable as the plastic was digging into my skin. I figured something has to be defective here, why would BOTH shoes develop these holes in the exact same spot from what I would consider light use for running shoes. Unfortunately, 3 months is just outside the amazon limit for returns so I turned to Nike expecting them to remedy this for me, I filled a claim through their customer support system and paid to send them the shoes back. about a week and a half later Nike told me that this was ""wear and tear"" and that they would not return / refund / exchange the shoes - I escalated the issue and asked for another review, which was AGAIN rejected and I was told it's wear and tear. So ultimately, I ended up out 80 bucks for the shoes, 10 bucks to ship them to nike for essentially 3 months of light use. This is NOT how I would expect a brand I've been loyal to for years to handle it's customers or it's products. Needless to say, after nike returned my shoes to me, I promptly threw them (and my 90 dollars) in the trash and order some Under Armour Infinite running 2's. Sadly, this is likely my last nike product, I can't purchase products from a company not willing to stand behind its brand. I'd highly recommend avoiding this shoe, unless u like sharp plastic :).",1,0,28
I can‚Äôt believe they try to pull this off as ‚Äòwide fit‚Äô. The arch support area is one of the most narrow running shoe I‚Äôve ever put on to the point where I laughed when I put all the weight on my foot. I‚Äôm only 6ft 190 lbs I don‚Äôt even have that wide of a foot. These are for someone who‚Äôs 5‚Äô5‚Äù 150lbs. Such a waste of time ordering these and having to return them now. I should have just taken a trip to the shoe store.,2,0,28
"I love these shoes. I normally do not purchase shoes online but I found this pair with this seller and I love Nike shoes which I usually purchase through the Nike Employee Store in Beaverton Oregon, but because of the COVID-19 that store has been closed for a month and I have limited access when that store is open. I found these pair on line and the price was actually really good. The shoes fit perfectly and they are super light and great for running. What a difference. I completely recommend these shoes. If you are looking for a really light fully supportive running shoe look no further. Way to go Nike.",5,1,28
"Today, 6/5, I noticed the bottom heal has come apart.
Less than 3 weeks after purchase.
Normal wear and tear of walking. These did not last as expected.
I would not expect this level of degradation, for at least a year.
I will not purchase again.",1,0,28
"Fit and comfort are ok, but with no removable insole, the entire shoe will need washing at some point. I usually remove the insole after a while and insert odor-eaters, but this shoe does not permit this substitution. I'll use these as slippers, and spend a little more to get a more convenient shoe.",3,0,28
"Bought these for my 16 year old son, who weighs about 160 pounds. It's like they are made out of cardboard. The side support in the shoes near the heel just ""bent."" You know, like how when you get a dent in your car that you can push out and then it pops right back into a dent? What in the world is that about? What kind of crappy material is in these shoes? They were like $100!",1,0,28
"While these shoes look great and fit perfectly fine, they have several issues. These are some of the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever worn. If I try to wear them, after about an hour my feet already hurt. They have almost no support at all and feel like I'm walking on bare concrete with each step. They also make this loud clicking sound with every step. It doesn't matter what I'm walking on, grass, turf, concrete, tile, wood. Click, click, click.",2,0,28
"I will miss these shoes. A few months after my purchase, Hurricane Ida struck and the flooding raw sewage ruined these shoes. They are cozy and easy to slip into, and very breatheable. The pattern is pleasing to the eye and unique. (This is the black and anthracite redwhite version). I wish I'd bought 11.5 wide. A little pricey for the action, however, and there is a notable CLICK sound from walking as the sole has a different pattern from the norm.",5,1,28
"It‚Äôs been 30 years since I bought a pair of Nike shoes.
I‚Äôve always wanted a pair of fire engine red sneakers, but was never able to find the right color red‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ until I bought these. I have multiple pairs of Reebok sneakers, which I love, but I was never able to find the true red I was looking for until I bought these. They are light weight, fit perfect in every way.",5,1,28
"First some context... I have a knee injury, when I purchase shoes they normally last me 3 to 4 years. This Nike shoes I purchased in May of 2020, they started to fall apart before Jan 2021. I live in Texas and like I said a knee injury that prevents me from doing a lot. The shoes bottoms do not wear out in my shoes as I don't drag my feet since it would cause me a lot more pain. The shoe soles is what wears out and causes me to replace my shoes

Problem - The shoe bottoms started detaching them selves from the rest of the shoe around Nov 2020. I used gel super glue because it was just a tiny corner that came up ...at first. since the bottoms are put on like a puzzle set some of the corners face the front of the shoe causing me to stumble when walking. Its now May 2021 and they have become on usable almost and I'm looking to buy some different shoes now.

Hope that helps",1,0,28
"I am a woman with wide flat feet and I ordered the 8.5 mens shoes. I've done with this with Nike shoes before, and haven't had a fit issue. In fact, I have the Nike Mens Metcons 3 in 8.5 and use those for crossfit and those work perfectly ( except that the shoes squeak, but whatever.) I bought this pair to use strictly for walking/running and the this particular fit is just too narrow. About 20 minutes in, my arches and heel start to throb. They fit like a womens width, in my opinion. So, end of story, good for running errands, but not long walks or actual running.",3,0,28
"Read through these comments. You'll find that these shoes make annoying pops or squeaks. This is a fact. it doesn‚Äôt matter if you are walking on something hard or something soft, it‚Äôs going to squeak. It‚Äôs going to be very loud. I've had mine for two weeks and I hoped the noise would go away. It doesn‚Äôt. You may think it won‚Äôt bother you, but it will. Just don‚Äôt buy these. I think maybe it‚Äôs the sole design. It's horrible.",1,0,28
Right heel ripped barely 2 months after buying. Plastic bit sticking out. Invest in something better.,1,0,28
"The size was probably a half size larger than what was indicated (US 10). It's the first pair of Nike I got that didn't fit perfectly. The collar is so stiff that walking around my home for a few minutes left me in pain and red marks where the collar rubbed my skin (which may be due to the shoes being too large). I planned on returning them, but unfortunately, they came from Amazon UK and I have to pay $35 return postage on $67 pair of shoes.",1,0,28
"These shoes were great at first, but they broke down very, very quickly. The shoe has a rigid plastic piece behind the fabric where the heel rests. The fabric has been cut but the plastic and now whenever I use these shoes, I get scratching but the internal plastic bit.

That made what would have been an excellent running shoe into an unusable piece of trash. I paid too much for this.",1,0,28
My son and I own a pair. Within weeks one pair of shoes started to click and the tread started coming off both of them within 1 month. I was out of my return window so I called Nike to open a claim. They don‚Äôt send a return label to send the shoe back for inspection and I was quoted $30 to ship it back through the UPS Store. These shoes will not last. It seems like Nike makes cheap shoes and sells them for a premium price now because their products don‚Äôt seem to last.,1,0,28
This shoe was purchased for my son. He has a wide foot and said these were super comfortable. The white bottom is hard to keep clean but he likes them. I‚Äôd recommend these.,5,1,28
"I purchased this shoe for my yearly replacement shoe (I usually buy the Nike Air Pegasus) which actually looks like a Nike and feels like one. I didn't realize it initially, but the insole didn't have the Nike insignia--that should have given away the fact that this is in fact a fake Nike shoe. I cannot trust what I buy on Amazon anymore.",1,0,28
"Let me start with I run a fair amount, usually five times a week totaling approximately 20ish miles. When I first received these shoes I was not happy with what I got. When I put them on there were gaps under the laces where you could see your socks, the tongue didn't cover all the way and it was very visible since they were black shoes. Maybe I have high arches or something but I was less than pleased, and then I went for a run. I can still see my socks but they are now my favorite running shoes, very comfortable, light and the sole design works very nicely for a heel to toe stride. I plan to buy another pair in a different color.",5,1,28
"Love them. Firm soles. Soft webbing that touches toes. I use them for walking.
(UPDATE)
After a few weeks of breaking them in, they are very very flimsy and weak. Not happy with these Nikes.",1,0,28
"Compre este producto para regalarlo, y resulta que lleg√≥ con el tag de seguridad de la tienda, adem√°s se ve√≠a usado, al parecer era el de muestra: los cordones se ven desgastados y tambi√©n la suela. Fue una experiencia muy mala.",2,0,28
"The shoes look good and fit's good. The only problem is there is a seam on the right shoe that protrudes a bit on the back of the heal, requiring heavy socks to prevent discomfort. 7 months later The right shoe developed a click INSIDE the sole. Can not figure out to fix it . I will try to go through Nike customer service.",4,1,28
"The shoe is comfortable and fits as expected. The fit is on par with all other Nike brand shoes. I am not a runner, but at least I look good wearing these.

Update: I had to return these shoes for a quality issue. The shoes fit fine and were comfortable, but the right shoe was making a clicking sound when walking. There was something loose within the sole. At least Amazon has a good return policy.",3,0,28
"I'm a big guy who loves to run. I put in 30+ miles of running in a week. I usually need to change my shoes out every 3-4 months. I've used all brands and styles for running, and this was one of the better ones. Honestly, I picked it for the look and great price. I was pleasantly surprised on the nice fit and enjoyable comfort. They held up for the 4 months I expected. My kids told me I had ""nice shoe game,"" as I got many compliments. Only downside was Amazon ran out of my size, so I bought another pair from the Nike site.",5,1,28
"Comfortable and lightweight. However, these shoes have developed an obnoxiously lout squeak while walking. Not like, my shoes are wet, pardon the squeak, but when dry, walking on both hard and soft carpeted flooring. I've looked around and this is a fairly common complaint with a few Nike shoes, including the Monarchs.

I won't be buying these shoes again and would discourage anyone from buying them unless you want people to look at you like WTF while walking through the grocery store.",3,0,28
"I like the shoe. It‚Äôs a nice looking shoe which i use for walking, many running shoes are also Used as a walking shoe, very good support. The NIKE brand is a trusted quality product. As of now the shoe works 4 me. The only issue I had with the shoe is the toe area is slightly narrow....for my foot. I just used my shoe ‚Äústretchers‚Äù, problem solvedüòáüòáüòá",5,1,28
"I have very wide feet. If I can find shoes that are EEE, it would be ideal. This Nike is just wide, E, but the fabric is very stretchy so the shoes fit very comfortably. I don't run but I walk a lot, and these shoes are perfect for me. And my size was available in the color I want, which is sometimes hard for me find.",5,1,28
"If you are running or deadlifting this is not the right shoe for you due to the sole being very thick and not ideal for those activities. But that's ok because that's not what this shoe is for. If you are looking for something dirt cheap, moderately fashionable, and durable look no further. A year later they are scuffed, dirty, but still somehow hanging on. A little part of the sole is coming off, but nothing else is coming apart. I'm tempted to wear them until they start falling apart, but it would probably take another couple years. Good buy, highly recommend.",5,1,28
Falling apart when I received them. Don't buy extremely low quality! Go for the under armour running shoes they are much better better quality better everything than Nike.,1,0,28
So I really liked these shoes. Super light and comfortable. I got the white with the light blue check. The material is super soft. I would recommend to get a darker color. My German Shepard put her paw on the front and it was EXCEPTIONALLY hard to get it off. The material really absorbs the littlest bit of dirt. They feel and look good. I know that‚Äôs the main point of shoes along with the cost. I‚Äôd say just be careful when and where you wear these. Unless you just don‚Äôt care about that.,3,0,28
I guess Nike has a series of small behind shoes. I thought it was an accident refunded my money and bought from nike... I bought the wrong size and luckily I did because they fit. Moral of the story ...order this shoe at least a size and a half or 2 up.,1,0,28
"I have been running in Revolutions for years now. The 5 is a big improvement over the 4. For my foot type, the 4 climbed up too high and rubbed against my ankle. The 5 is much more comfortable. Everybody has different feet, but these definitely work nicely for the basic health-maintenance type of running that I do.",5,1,28
Great price for Nike shoes. The shoes are lughr weight and comfortable. I wear size 9.5 and they was spot on. As for now without knowing how long they will last im so far happy with purchase.,4,1,28
This is the second pair of these shoes that I have purchased for my husband. He has a very wide foot and these fit him just right and are very comfortable/,5,1,28
"I had the shoes for about 1 month before I started wearing them regularly. It was about 2-3 weeks after I started wearing them when they started clicking/squeaking when I walked. Didn't matter whether I was on hardwood, concrete, grass, etc. They make an awful noise. It was too late to return them.",1,0,28
"The plastic tread on these shoes creates a 'bubble' that pops every time you step. It's like a suction cup to the ground. If you ever walk or run on flat surfaces, I hope you don't mind otherwise it'll drive you insane. I've noticed that it impacts the way I walk/run as well.

They are extremely comfortable, however, so if you mostly run on grass/dirt they're probably a good find.",3,0,28
"I was expecting a little more from the shoe, comfort level is just fine but a far cry from the last pair I bought from nike. These are pretty stiff overall and don't seem to add any bounce to your steps leading to a flatter feel. I primarily jog and walk around with these and they do the job but I doubt I would buy this pair again.",3,0,28
"I purchased a size 12 extra large. Nike usually run small for me. These are the best fitting shoes I‚Äôve ever had. I need extra wide anyway, and these are comfortable, and I‚Äôm able to work out as well.",5,1,28
"These look similar to h the e epic react 2, which I have and love. They have similar looking soles. But the soles on these shoes is rock hard. It‚Äôs almost comical how stiff and plastic feeling it is. The other soles are extremely soft. Sent these back right away.",3,0,28
My son has very wide and thick feet. This is the first Nike shoe we have found that is truly wide and not hideous and orthopedic looking. He says they are very comfortable so we are hoping they will hold up well.,4,1,28
"They are just good shoes for hanging, lounging, walking, even some light hiking. They are also excellent for mountain biking! Please, please, please don't discontinue these Nike shoes.",5,1,28
Great shoe but someone miss glued the left shoe and there is an air bubble in that shoe and it goes click click click every step I take and is very annoying and it started after it was to late to return the shoes.,3,0,28
"While the toe box looks very wide, in fact it is probably only 1/2"" wider than a regular Nike (which are very narrow in my opinion). Just that little bit of extra makes this a very comfortable shoe. I have had other Nikes in this same style, and I like the wide better.",5,1,28
"I didn't like this shoe and DO NOT recommend for anyone to buy it.

The cloth material is cheap and of poor quality. After wearing them a few times it was worn out at the toe level a whole ensued. After a few times wearing I will have to through them away, not at all what I expected of Nike.",1,0,28
"Arrived in battered box wound in a rubber band and bearing a $65.00 price tag. I paid $117. Sent it back, went to a mall, bought a comparable pair of Adidas for, well, $65.00. Caveat emptor, folks.",1,0,28
"I bought these to work in, but they came to me just unwrapped in a box. When you buy shoes, they come with paper stuffed inside and materials to hold their shape, etc. These arrived already laced in the box. It was like someone took the shoes off and sent them to me. I was HIGHLY disappointed in this purchase. I want another pair but let them come to me NEW, not having had anyone else's foot in them!",1,0,28
"I had the product for week now and lifted several times with it, and have gone on a walk. Its comfortable and fits as expected, no noticeable wear and tear, but the problem is going at anything more than a jog make it feel very uncomfortable. Doing any form of hiit cardio isn't optimal in these shoes, I haven't had a problem with previous trainers from other brands, and I did pay 70$ for this shoe.It works for now so I wont return it but I wish I had my money back.",2,0,28
"As a teacher, I‚Äôm on my feet most of the day. Fortunately, we are able to wear comfortable shoes like this. The shoes are wonderful. Are usually have to put inserts in my shoes to help with my back, but these do not need them at all. Plus, they fit into my fashion sense terrifically. I‚Äôm very happy with the purchase.",5,1,28
"My husband does find these comfortable, but they do make a weird popping noise when he walks on slicker surfaces. It's so loud that you could hear it when we were walking through a busy airport.",4,1,28
"Overall great Nike sneakers except... one of the shoes does a ‚ÄúSuction‚Äù ‚ÄúPop‚Äù sound with every step on hard floors. It is very loud, annoying, and embarrassing. I‚Äôm limited to just using outdoors... :(",2,0,28
"The shoes are fine as long as I wear them in a loud place. The right shoe has developed a squeak that I think is coming from inside the shoe. Whenever I step off with my right foot, a squeak/pop sound comes from the sole. I can feel it in the bottom of my foot. Annoying.",2,0,28
Nice comfortable shoes for my husband. He normally wears a 10.5 but gets an 11 for comfort. But these were still a little tight he needed an 11.5 but he said it's livable. So I'd recommend to size up .5 -1 size. Nice runners aside from that,4,1,28
"They're like boats. I have wide feet but these things were made for ducks. Truly, the widest shoe I've ever seen. If you have extra toes or extreme bunions these shoes are for you.",4,1,28
"I got these for my husband who wears an 11.5 in all his shoes/sneakers (Except adidas, he has one pair of 11s). He said they felt pretty good, but came home from a run with bloody toes. We can't exchange for a larger size for obvious reasons.",3,0,28
"I was very happy with the shoes until the third week of wearing them a LOUD suction cup sound started during each step! This was happening while walking on a variety of different outdoor surfaces so it is the shoe, not something btw the shoe and the ground. Sending back, my wife was embarrassed to walk beside me!",1,0,28
"The shoes are functional and comfortable, but after only 1 month of use both shoes make a terribly annoying squeaky sound when walking on hard surfaces. It doesn't happen on carpet or outside on the grass/dirt. I will not buy another pair of these shoes. I would have given a solid 4 star rating if they didn't make such a soul-disturbing sound.",2,0,28
"I never even got to wear the pair I ordered due to a shipping technicality. But considering the track record I‚Äôve had with Nike, all the highest scores are too be expected and earned. A wise purchase :)",4,1,28
"I ordered these because I have been wearing Nike shoes for years and always have enjoyed them. However, I got two pairs in a row with the same defect. The right shoe has a defect in the sole that causes a popping sound every time I took a step, very annoying. And unbelievable that two pairs in a row had the same issue.",1,0,28
First time ordering shoes on-line. Fit good and they are comfortable. After a month or so the right one started having a ‚Äúpopping‚Äù noise but could just be me working in them and not the shoes. Would deff buy again.,5,1,28
My husband has been having trouble finding a shoe that fits properly to give him comfort for walking the bike path and this one did the trick for him. His feet are happy.,5,1,28
"Muy comodos para hacer ejercicio, no pasan y no agarran mal olor.",5,1,28
bought to replace my Nike Zoom shoes. the bottoms on these are hard enough they make a noise like 70's films did when a person is walking down a sidewalk. they look good and are fine for wearing the store and such but are not cushiony in the least for running. going back to nike zoom.,3,0,28
"The shoes are very comfortable, even when worn for long periods of time. They offer good support and fit snugly around my feet. However they don't last very long. After only a few months, the outsole began to separate at the toe and wear out along the inside edge. While I wear them everyday, I am gentle with my things and have not done any strenuous activity with them, even though they are marketed as athletic shoes.",3,0,28
"Had 2 pair of Nikes previously so I was confident that the fit would be good, and it is. Very comfortable. The wider width works with my feet! Good value.",4,1,28
Shoes are nice but they make too much noise when you're walking there is a big click clack the whole time you walk so if you're trying to be quiet no way,4,1,28
I feel like these are fake. These are the squeakiest shoes I've ever owned. And not like the bottom. They are squeaky on carpet. It's like when I bend on the ball of my toes squeak squeak squeak. Everyone knows I'm coming. Lol.,1,0,28
"These are very comfortable and great for my workouts. However, after about 3 weeks, the left shoe started to make a crack noise on every step as if a rock was stuck in the bottom. The noise is coming from inside the shoe. Then, after a month, the right shoe started doing the same thing. They are now so annoyingly loud that I can't wear them. From a performance standpoint, they are great. Craziest thing how both seem to have broken somehow and make this noise.",2,0,28
"Shoes have been worn, have dirt on soles and dirt on the side of one of them. Box was broken as though someone stepped on it and saran wrapped to attempt to fix. Very unhappy as this was supposed to be a Christmas gift.",1,0,28
"Fits well, comfortable shoe but I'm on vacation at Disney and after getting to the park my right shoe started to squeak so for the next 15,000 steps (fit bit) I, my group, and everyone around me had to hear my squeaking shoes. Love Nike but very disappointed.",2,0,28
Honestly like the shoe; however after only using them 3 times at the gym I noticed the bottom of the shoe was already starting to separate. Maybe it‚Äôs just this pair that has the issue but I‚Äôd be careful if you‚Äôre planning On purchasing them.,1,0,28
"First pair of shoes I've ever purchased online and couldn't be more thrilled how well it turned out. Great shoes, fit perfectly. Will consider buying next pair online again. Way too convenient. üëç",5,1,28
"la talla pedida que siempre uso ajusta perfectamente, ni grandes ni peque√±os, muy bonitos y comodos.",5,1,28
"Rebought this shoe after a year because it is exactly what I wanted. Nike shoes run quite narrow, so this wide version is excellent. Fits comfortably, right colors to be inconspicuous, really nice.",5,1,28
"The first pair had a ‚Äúclick‚Äù with every step, in the right shoe. Annoying, ordered a second pair and the EXACT same thing happened, only in the left shoe! One week after owning. Nice defect Nike!",1,0,28
"In my experience and preference, the heal foam on this shoe is way too hard. Might as well be concrete.
The look and fit is great, but not a running shoe in my opinion.",2,0,28
The right shoe started to squeak after a couple weeks. Can't return them as they are used now but it's incredibly annoying. They are work shoes now,1,0,28
My husband uses these for his moving job they works well and keep his feet from hurting. He's hard on shoes especially at this job but they have lasted 7 months and are just starting to show wear and tear.,5,1,28
"Did not have cushion inside the sole, or the heel, the heel was rock hard, 190 lbs. Of body weight I could not get the heel to compress. I ended up returning them, I‚Äôm gonna stick with ASICS,",1,0,28
"Shoes are comfortable and fit as expected....the color is perfect to wear with work out gear from work....however the right shoe started squeeking, and hasn't stopped squeaking....",3,0,28
My teenager loves these shoes. Xwide is truly hard to find. Thank you for being so considerate and offering this option. I will look for you again for future purchases.,5,1,28

Nice style & material. Not easy to find 14w but these were perfect fit for my 12 year old nephew. He says they‚Äôre comfortable and stylish.,5,1,28
"Great shoes, light weight but good support. The shoes tend to run a size small. I usually wear a 10 and got these in 11 and they fit well.",5,1,28
"Fits really well and when sizing, keep in mind most Nike shoes tend to be a half size smaller than other brands.",5,1,28
I bought these sneakers for my husband to work out in. He said those sneakers are the most comfortable sneakers he has ever worn. They are lightweight and great for working out in.,5,1,28
I don't use these to actually run but they are so comfortable that I use them on a daily basis. They are very lightweight!,5,1,28
"My other favorite shoe was Revolution 4 but the 5 has replaced it. I have a wide foot so the 4e wide is perfect. The most comfortable shoe made, as with the 4, I will have have multiple pairs in my closet so I can replace them as they wear down. I have tried other brands like New Balance and others but none compare with the comfort of the Nike Revolution 5.",5,1,28
"Nike is always good, just wish they would lower their prices since they only pay people 25 cents an hour to make them... smfh",5,1,28
The show has a terrible cushion. The sole makes the sound of a leather shoe. People turn around when I‚Äôm walking behind them.,3,0,28
"I am a walker, not a runner. These shoes are ideal for walking, good comfortable fit and flexible for a rolling step",5,1,28
"My grandson won't wear anything else. Very comfortable and nice looking. However, since it's a fabric shoe, it doesn't last forever especially on a 12 year old's foot everyday. That's not really a drawback since kid's feet grow so fast.",5,1,28
"Got it in black, this shoe looks and feels great for the price. There is a good amount of bounce and support to the shoes. My only concern is durability. I will update the review if they last less than a year. Hopefully there will be no updates.

Cheers",5,1,28
"I asked to replace this product twice. And the three pair of shoes that I received came with the same problem. Ever tune you walk there is a sound ‚ÄúTik Tik Tik‚Äù the three of them! Omg it‚Äôs a company/production problem!!
Other than this, they are nice.",3,0,28

"I jog 3 miles on asphalt most days, landing on mid foot or toes, weigh 140lbs. What I like about shoe is the super comfortable uppers without seams...plenty wide to accommodate toes. These are not cushy shoes, which is fine for the type of jogging I do, but would not work perhaps for heavier or heel landing runners. They took about 30-40 miles to break in...the ankle collar at first was digging into my left ankle bone, but that has completely resolved now.",4,1,28
"Very comfortable, decent ankle support for working out. Great for running errands as well. High quality material and comfortable sole",5,1,28
Great sneakers as always. Nike never disappointed me. And the seller delivered it faster than the date was given to me. Came one week earlier,5,1,28
Bought as a Christmas gift not sure if he really likes them but they‚Äôre not that light weight. The box it arrived in was pretty mangled.,4,1,28
"My boyfriend and I wear everything Nike, bought these for him to wear to the gym after seven months they have completely fallen apart. When he first got them they were comfortable and fit perfectly. They are very comfortable and worth the money just wish they didn‚Äôt fall apart so easily after not even a year of wearing them.",3,0,28
"Breathable, workable, and more. This shoe comes highly recommended. I decided to buy two pairs it's so good!",5,1,28
"I run or bike every day for hours. I usually go with Nike or Adidas. Just got these in, tried them on. They look great and are super comfy. Some of the reviews complained about a clicking noise, I have no clue what they are talking about, but I'm buying a second pair for when I'm not working out. I got the all black color.",5,1,28
not as much cushion as other NIKE shoes i own.,3,0,28
These shoes are a game changer. I‚Äôm on my feet for 10+ hours a day. I didn‚Äôt know I needed these shoes. Great investment. Considering upgrading to vapor airs when these eventually bite the dust.,5,1,28
"Bought these for everyday wear. Shoes are very comfortable and the fit is also.,Highly reccomended!",5,1,28
I bought these shoes for my husband before i had surgery. They were a Birthday gift. I completely let time get away from me. Would you please reconsider allowing me to exchange the size? He really likes the shoe.,5,1,28
I bought these for my husband he wears them everywhere even to work. He's on his feet all day and he tells me he loves his shoes that they're very comfortable. The style is also a good look for everyday wear.,5,1,28
"Nice kicks, light and great fit. All black look is great when you wear them with business casual clothes. I take the train into work and walk a mile to and from the train station. These shoes look great and you can‚Äôt tell they are running shoes.",5,1,28
They took off the strap on the back of the shoe which is so helpful in putting the shoe on. Now it is difficult to get the foot in. But once inside it still is so very comfy.,3,0,28
These shoes are light weight and comfortable. I really was enjoying them until the right shoe developed some type of click or pop in the sole as you walk. I only wear them to work M-F 8-5. I sit at a desk a lot so it's not like I put a lot of miles on them. Everyone near my office can hear me walking. I wish I could return them but oh well. Buyer beware.,1,0,28
Bought these for my husband and he said his feet felt better immediately. Comfortable and durable,5,1,28
"Good shoes, light weight, good for a good run or walk. I drive a lot and find these uncomfortable on long hour drives",4,1,28
"This show clicks whenever I walk. So annoying. I keep hoping it will stop, but nope. Click click click.",1,0,28
Bought two pair. Gray ones and a red & white pair. Wore them a couple months. The Grey pair still comfortable wear them all the time. The red ones have a seem that started rubbing and hurts. Not sure why same size and everything.,4,1,28
"The shoes would be great, if they didn't make a click or pop sound in them after EVERY STEP. In hindsight, there are many online complaints in this same defect, yet I missed them before buying. There is even a Nike help sight that says once broken in, the click goes away.....it does NOT. They are comfortable, as long as you are ok with alerting everyone in the area you are near.",1,0,28
No me agrado con todo respeto los dos tenis se decoloran ante lamluz del sol,1,0,28
I love these shoes except for one small problem. They are not slip resistant at all. The slightest lack of friction can have you fumbling. It's more for walking at a moderate pace or home use. This shoe would be perfect if there was more grip at the bottom. Other similar Nike shoe's had it so why not these?,4,1,28
"My boyfriend was constantly wearing a pair of extremely beat-up and tattered Nikes that he got several years ago. I got these as a birthday gift for him to replace the older pair, and he loves them! He loves the look and says they're comfortable!",5,1,28
I wear an 11 but always order a 12 with Nike. Works out every time. Great shows that last.,5,1,28
Not the best shoe. Heels become very worn over time leading to a lot of pain,3,0,28
Great shoes while they lasted. Had to glue the bottoms back on several times in less than a year. Not good. Just didn't last long enough for the cost.,2,0,28
This is a very hard soled shoe. Almost like hard plastic. Using on carpet it is fine but any hard surface and the shoe is loud and not comfortable.,3,0,28
Gift for my husband! He loves these shoes‚Ä¶ extremely comfortable,5,1,28
Great to find a size 14 of all black kicks for my big man - fast delivery - they are on the pricier side though,5,1,28
"After wearing for a few hours one of the shoes developed a bubble of some sort within the sole that makes a loud popping sound whenever you step down. Within three days, the sole on the other shoe started to come apart and peel off. I'm not sure if this is quality problem with Nike or if these are cheap knock-offs.",1,0,28
"I love Nike running shoes, always have. The most comfortable for my feet, in my opinion. These fit great, light weight. I really enjoy wearing them!",5,1,28
If you need an arch do not buy. Toe box is big . I usually do Monarch air . I will stick with it.,1,0,28
"My 11 year old son is fickle about his shoes. He not only has to have them fit a certain way, but they have to be cool. He loves these shoes. He says they are very comfortable.",5,1,28
"Not sure if this is typical for the model, or if I just got a bum pair, but every few steps taken they seem to pop somewhere in the bottom. It sounds like a quieter version of a bang snap, and occurs on each shoe semi randomly. Other than that the shoes are comfortable, and look fine, there just must be some kind of air pocket between the adhesive and the bottoms of the shoes or something.",3,0,28
"Left shoe appears defective, with a hard ridge on the inner sole.

Second pair has the same defect, but in the right shoe. Lowering review to one star. These are garbage.",1,0,28
These were comfortable sneakers however I got them wet once and the a piece of plastic in the inside of the back of foot inseam broke and it cuts into my heel. Only had them for 6 weeks.,3,0,28

Great pair of shoes for working out in the gym.,5,1,28
"They were great at first. But after about a week, they started to squeak at almost every step I took. It seemed like on each step, air was forced out of air pockets within the soles. Drive my walking companion nuts.",1,0,28
My son likes this shoe so much he asked me to order it again after almost 2 years of running and playing other school sports. They can handle the constant wear and tear of teenagers. The shoes could have gone another year but he needed a half size bigger.,5,1,28
"Poor fit, not for my bardly Bunion feet. Returned.",3,0,28
"I have really wide feet; a size 4E. It's always a challenge to find a shoe that actually fits. Nike has been hit and miss so far, but this shoe actually fits, and I couldnt be happier.
I'll be buying another pair soon just in case they discontinue this model.",5,1,28

"The pictures attached to this review tell a complete story. Even the shoe box appeared used upon opening the package. To my surprise when I flipped the shoes over, the soles where completely dirty.

I walk about 2 to 3 miles daily and although the shoes were comfortable, they did squeak with every step. I would not recommend this shoe.",2,0,28
The sole in the right shoe developed a defect after about 1 month of light use. The defect developed under the ball of my foot so it makes the shoe quite uncomfortable.,1,0,28

It is weightless when you walk. It fits perfectly. Used this when I was running and going to stores.,5,1,28
The shoes seem to be low quality. The glue is very visible and my shoe even came with a white stain. After one fitness workout. I can now see a little opening in the glue. These shoes are very low quality. And the fit is a little tight. I suggest getting a half size bigger. I‚Äôm scared to see how these shoes will hold up on the long run. Won‚Äôt order shoes on amazon anymore.,1,0,28

"As some of you know, finding wide good looking shoes can be a challenge at times. These Nike's are good looking, a great fit and comfortable. When I first put them on I could already tell they were quality. If you are looking for a inexpensive everyday shoe these are perfect for you.",4,1,28

Looks good and quality is good. Feels good for walking and gym. But it‚Äôs not for running or hiking. I have ran many miles with different shoes and this one is not that type. Slow response to gravity and you could be halfway down before you know you‚Äôve slipped. It‚Äôs also heavy which slows down your pace.,3,0,28

Received this order recently (March 2021). Have worn the shoes less that 10 times and the right shoe is already popping like there is a break in the sole. Which causes me to change my walk/run to stop the popping which eventually causes foot pain. They don‚Äôt make products like they used to.,1,0,28
Very light shoe! Great support for walking and running. Also the mesh material allows it to breathe well and keep you feet cool.,5,1,28

"One of the shoes makes a weird noise when I am walking, does not affect usability or efficiency but can be annoying.",4,1,28
Everyday wear. Something broken inside one sole on day one. A week later the other one broke. There is a popping sound with every step. It sounds like I‚Äôve stepped in gum and the shoes are sticking to a sidewalk.,3,0,28
We have only had these sneakers for 1 week and the black sole that curves up to the top of the shoe has already peeled back. I tried to glue it back on but now the top of shoe has a glue stain. Very disappointed with the poor workmanship for this brand and price.,1,0,28
