I ordered these in my normal shoe size but they ran much too large.,1,0,14
"VERY frustrating that after less than 5 months of extremely light wear, one of the straps broke and the shoe is now useless. We have been on distance learning since the pandemic began so we rarely leave the house. My son has BARELY worn these shoes and they are now useless to us. I cannot afford to replace my son's shoes every 5 months! Buying these was a huge mistake and a big disappointment.",1,0,14
"I tried these in a local shoe store and felt great in the 5min or so of trying them on there but couldn't get my size AND a decent color from them

1: I picked these because of the very soft/cushioned outer sole and insole, but the cushion seemed to have deflated / compacted after roughly only a month

2: the fake shoe laces (just a giant loop) don't have any way to lock them down even if you pull them tight
this means the foot moves inside the shoe and can cause blisters",2,0,14
"Its a great looking shoe. I saw it in the store and specifically looked for this shoe online because we liked it so much.
Bought it for my 12 yr old. SO disappointed in the quality though! Very thin fabric - that makes it breathable, but also means toes pop through in no time. The fabric is peeling away from the sole after less than a month of wear. If Im going to spend that much on a shoe, I will buy a brand that holds up better next time.",2,0,14
"They said size 10 US, but were 11. I have a lot of sneakers/shoes from many different brands and the size is always consistent. When I returned them at Kohls/Amazon drop off, I bought the same exact same pair in a 10 and they fit perfect. When applying for the return on Amazon, I noticed someone else had also commented they were a size too large. I'd recommend picking them up somewhere else to be safe and avoid having to return them.",1,0,14
"I ordered these for my son to have new school shoes. They lasted a mere 8 DAYS before the loops ripped out and now they are in-wearable! Total junk shoes DO NOT BUY. My son has a broken shoulder right now and cannot participate in gym class or recess so these were used for nothing more than walking within the school building. Adidas should be ashamed. Now - because they were purchased on Amazon and not my local retailer, returns will be extremely difficult if not impossible. What a waste.

Additionally- note that these are a very wide fitting shoe and run big overall. If you have a narrow foot beware - that is - if the thought of paying $65 for shoes that will be unwearable in a couple days doesn’t deter you from buying them in the first place.",1,0,14
"Came with silver painted numbers on the front toe where everyone can see them. Also not connected together and just sent loose in a bag and not a adidas box. Even after reading good reviews, I’m questioning if these are real adidas sneakers. I’ve seen $10 sneakers with better quality",1,0,14
"Received the pair in a beaten box. The paper inside each shoe looked re-wadded. I suspect I was given a used pair, which would explain why the lacing was all messed up on one of the shoes.

Disappointed that Amazon would even consider sending me this. I've owned a pair before and they were good, so I'll have to update my review if they can send me a working pair.",1,0,14
I bought a size 12 for my teenage son to use for running during his JROTC Raiders program. Buyer beware these are a slide on shoe and the shoelaces are just for looks. There is no way to tighten them. My son is very thin and has thin ankles and the shoe would fall off of his foot when he tried to even walk in them. I ended up having to cut those shoelaces off and that was very difficult because they were stitched into the bottom loop on the toe of the shoe. I had to pull it apart with tweezers which took me darn near an hour and then I had to go out and buy extra long shoelaces to then lace up the shoe and tie it tightly. If you are actually wearing these for walking or running I don't recommend buying them unless you want to have to do what I did. Otherwise they are a great looking shoe well made and very lightweight. But why would you sell a running shoe that cannot be adjusted for tightness. This was definitely fashion over function.,3,0,14
"Hole within the sneaker on toe. Will need replacement ASAP. If not will get credit from amazon prime member if not replaced prime as issues credit next day. Just got my credit
Horrible product worst customer service. Do I have say anymore.",1,0,14
"I bought these for my husband as a birthday gift. They look great on him, but he says they feel loose and his feet slide around in the shoe. I ordered his usual size he wears in adidas shoes. My family basically only wears adidas shoes because they are quality made and durable. I have 3 sons who go through shoes fairly quickly, but adidas holds up much longer.",3,0,14
"Perfect fit except for my heel, kept popping up and rubbing and ended up getting a blister. They squeak like crazy too, my coworkers started calling me squidward with the way my footsteps sound. Some of the loops that hold the laces popped out. Lacing system was... interesting. I love adidas sneakers but these were disappointing.",3,0,14
Ordered my husband a pair because he already has some and these are way too big he is an 11 ordered an 11 and too bigike two socks needed too big. May need to order a size down to keep away from the return process.,3,0,14
"These shoes fit great, very comfortable. I was looking for a lightweight shoes to take a daily 3 mile walk in the neighborhood. The issue I had is after a week the soles wore out. I thought it was just a defect so I returned the shoes and ordered a new pair. The same thing happened on the second pair and I had to return them as well.",2,0,14
"I really wanted to give these a better rating because of the support/comfort, but since the laces can’t be tightened my son can’t run (play basketball, certain exercises) or they about come off his feet. Unfortunately they aren’t as snug as they need to be to stay on. That’s really the only bad thing I can say about them, but for him that’s a pretty big problem.",3,0,14
I was so excited because of getting older and less flexible to find a sneaker that was slip-on and reasonably priced. The problem is these are not as easy to slip on as I was hoping. I still require 2 hands and have to bend low and struggle to get over my heel. My budget doesn't allow me to try some of the other brands.,3,0,14
My son liked that they were comfortable. Two days into him wearing them to school the little loops that holds the lace started to detach from the sneakers. Adidas? When did the quality go down? I don't think I will buy this brand again. Very disappointed. They are his only sneakers right now so how can I return them.,1,0,14
These shoes got dirty so fast !!! I mean right away! And then I just noticed the price dropped over $20 since I purchased them a few weeks ago! Do not buy these shoes if they are over $ 45 - which is what the price is now - I paid $65 and every piece of dirt sticks to them !! Do not purchase !unless you like dirty white shoes.,2,0,14
"You can't adjust these laces. I guess they are supposed to magically fit. For my son, the length of the sole was perfect, but the shoe expects a foot with much more volume, so it was just loose. THERE IS NO WAY TO ADJUST THE LACES. You can either take your chances and order or tell Adidas this is nonsense and don't buy them.",2,0,14
"After wearing the shoes a dozen times or so over a 4 month period - they’ve never even been washed - one of the “laces” pulled out. Amazon’s return window closes after 30 days, and I haven’t reached out to Adidas yet... disappointed.",1,0,14
"These shoes were
bought on 28 Mar 2021
and
delivered on 30 Mar 2021.

In less than
Sixty days of normal walking,
they Look like This.

Both the Left and Right shoe are tearing at the seams.

I Could never in good conscience recommend this shoe.",1,0,14
"I bought this because it is supposed to have cloud foam in it. My other shoes with cloudfoam feel like pillows on your feet, super comfortable. This pair had a very firm sole and it not comfortable at all. Also it does not have adjustable shoe laces so you are suck with what they give you.",2,0,14
"This shoe was great for the few months that the tread existed. I don't know if they used a softer material or something relative to other shoes, but its already developed several smooth spots on the sole. This has caused me to slip in damp conditions (after a very light rain).

They're probably great if you don't use them a lot, or only use them lightly. I run, lift, and go for long walks on unpaved trails, and that use tore smoothed them out pretty quick. Very easy to get on and off though!",3,0,14
"Color descriptions and pictures do not match up. I selected black shoes with a white sole (based on the pictures). I got the right shoe style, but the wrong color. The shoes I received were all black, including the soles. Super annoying, these are a gift so I will see if they are ok with this color otherwise I will return.",2,0,14
Completely wrong color shoes. Ordered all black. Recieved black white and green. Shoes fit about a size larger than what they're stated too even though it claims true to size.,1,0,14
"These looked great and fit great for a short time, however the soles aren’t durable. My son has worn them to walk sparingly over the last few weeks, and has run in them 3 times. Just 3! These seem more suited for someone who isn’t active, which is opposite to how they’re marketed.",3,0,14
They are cheaply made. The side of shoe split from sole within 30 days of purchase. Ordered a replacement pair think that first pair were a lemon. Second pair broke at same spot on new shoe within 20 days of receiving them. Save your money and buy something different.,1,0,14
"These shoes were purchased for my 14yr old son for tennis. He liked them because they were lightweight and comfortable. However, after 4 weeks of only being worn to tennis practice and matches, these shoes fell apart! Not what we would expect from Adidas.",1,0,14
"I was looking for a laceless running shoe and tried this since it was cheap. The shoe is comfortable but too loose on my narrow feet (I wear thirteens, cue Biggie). I feel like my feet may slip out during running on the treadmill. The outsole has also worn down significantly after one single 5k run on the treadmill. These may become gym shoes or house slippers :(",2,0,14
Got these for my 10yr old and the mesh had ripped within a week just with normal play. These shoes are good for walking but not any type of normal 10 year old playing.,3,0,14
"I ordered this shoe, and had to have it immediately replaced due to a broken shoelace. The shoe is very spongy and offers little in the way of support. I'd say it is OK for the gym only, not for long walks.",3,0,14
"These are nice for what I bought them for, COMFORT. I have sore feet issues, and these are comfortable.
They are not tight enough, or supportive enough to be used for running distances.",3,0,14
"Horrible customer service. When shoes were purchased it said on Amazon's website that it was ""Free returns"". I received the shoes and they were a .5 size too big, but when I went to return them I was told I would be charged to ship them back and that would be subtracted from the refund price. That is not a ""free return"". Tried contacting customer service of League Outfitters and was told that was Amazon's Policy and there was nothing they could do.",1,0,14
I work in a small carpeted department store which is were I wore these. I’ve had them maybe three months and they just fell apart. They look really cool but for the money I can’t recommend them unless maybe you are in a wheel chair and will never walk around in them. This isn’t much different from most products now tho everything cost the same but is made cheaper. Crap product crap brand.,1,0,14
I'm not an avid runner but I do run shorter distances (1-3 miles). I was in the middle of a workout that had running and lifting and realized this was the worst shoe for either of these. My foot moves around in the shoe while running and the sole is to soft for lifting. Maybe they would be ok if you never made a turn but if you run around the block you feel like your foot is going one way and the shoe is going another.,1,0,14
Love the lite racer series. However these have been worn for a month and the soles are worn almost all the way down. The last 3 pairs 8 bought lasted 6 to 7 months before replacing.,3,0,14
"The shoes that came in do not match the shoes in the picture. Shoes in picture have white sole, shoes that came in is all black. I like the all black too but just make sure you read description colors and not look at picture for color.",3,0,14
I bought them as a gift for my brother The shoes ripped thru the front while he was running on the third day he used them not great quality for a size 13 foot apparently,1,0,14
I don’t know if I’m the only one having this problem but it has an annoying bump by the left side of the shoe in the left shoe. It’s really annoying I tried wearing them for a couple days but it feels the same,1,0,14
Definitely needs quality control,1,0,14
"Unfortunately, after one day of wearing these shoes one of the straps across the top snapped loose and now it just hangs. Poor design. I really like the shoe, it fits great but now it just looks silly. Trying to fix it but not sure how to tie the tiny sting that holds the loop together.",1,0,14
 Cheaply made. I’ve owned a few and all I do is walk around in them and they always tear in the same spot. Wouldn’t recommend.,1,0,14
"The description said used, didn’t realize they would be broken. If these are purchased new, they’re super nice and comfortable",1,0,14
"Love the shoe, and completely happy so far straight outta the box I have one complaint though. The color option was not what I picked. I asked for a pair of the black on white trim shoes. Instead I to my own disappointment received all black... I'd go through the return process but it's just a hassle.",2,0,14
"You cannot run in these shoes, they have no support. They cushy and better for lounging. Have fun jogging in these if you want an injury",2,0,14
This is my 3rd pair of the lite racer adapt 3 in size 13. My favorite shoe so far. First time purchasing off Amazon rather than adidas website. But this feels fake. Not comfortable/padded bottom. Tighter and more narrow than my other two pairs. Either they’re fake or they had a lapse in quality control. Looks real,2,0,14
Bought this for my husband on 06/21. He wore it 3 times and it broke today. Don't buy!!!! Not sure if it even authentic.,1,0,14
"Ripped at the toe!! After 1 month so awful my son couldn’t run freely , now he’s worried it’ll rip more",2,0,14
"2nd pair that I’ve received that had damage. Send first pair back due to what looked like teeth marks, now this? Not sure what the deal is but I won’t be wasting time returning again. No real solution to this issue, so I’ll just keep the damaged shoe",1,0,14
They fit great & very comfortable. Unfortunately less then a month of having them the side broke and laces are all one piece so cannot be fixed. Very disappointed with them. Not cheap so should last more then a month.,2,0,14
"Runs very large! My son’s current Addidas were size 11. We ordered a 10 and they are still too big. Got a 9 and 9.5 and the 9.5 fits perfectly. Great shoe, sizing is way off.",3,0,14
"Pros: Comfortable shoe. The fit was larger than expected but I could put up with that.

Cons: Extremely fast color fade. My black shoes are now purple after two months. I just noticed this hole as well and since I bought two months ago I can’t return them. I’m not very happy. Might have to switch to Nike",1,0,14
Not even three weeks old and already falling apart. The bottom tread is almost warn flat. From an 11 yo boy to boot. Terrible shoe. I expected more from adidas.,1,0,14
Amazon denied my return request for some reason I’m not entirely sure but they said it was outside of the window which wasn’t the case because it was only one week when I first submitted for return do no recommend,1,0,14
There is not way to tighten the shoe and the opening comes down way too far. It feels like a slipper not a sneaker.,3,0,14
To say these are large is an understatement. They are GIANT. like 2 whole sizes too big.,1,0,14
"Shoe fell apart in less than 30 days, and on day after the return window closed. Sad. Don't waste your money.",1,0,14
"The eyelet design is bad, I should've known but I wanted them to work. An eyelet ripped within a couple months of purchasing, so now I have a left shoe that is tight and the other is loose on the front left of my right foot. I would give a 5 star if they had designed the eyelets better. But without working laces it's not a running shoe anymore. The shoe is best meant for casual slip-on wear, no inclined or declined running/walking as it puts stress on the poor eyelet design.",1,0,14
Felt like the shoes were stretched out or a wide fit. They looked better in picture. Very lightweight and ran big for the size.,3,0,14
"Soles started separating on August 27, 2021. Ridiculous to have shoes that only last 3 months!!!",1,0,14
Purchased two pair and both right shoes were smaller than the left! 😭😡. These are my favorite work shoes! I don’t know what to buy now!!!,1,0,14
Incorrect shoes were sent twice.,1,0,14
"Poor poor quality, developed a hole in the big toe area of one shoe within a week or so",1,0,14
These sneakers were returned due to running a bit smaller than expected.,1,0,14
Bought these in May and it is beginning of July now and they shoes have already broken! The part where the laces attach to the shoe came off. Now they do not fit right....,1,0,14
One of the straps holding the laces to the sole broke after 2 days. I sent back.,1,0,14
"After a month or so, its already got a hole in it. And it was a gift for my son.",3,0,14
"The shoes were decently comfortable and light. I’m a waiter and bought them as work shoes. During about my 7th shift, I looked down and saw the lace dragging in the ground. The stitch ripped off and would be a tough fix. If I ripped off the whole lace, I would lose support… so kind of a sh!tty situation.",1,0,14
The shoe is coming apart after 5 weeks after normal use no excising. Tread didn’t last either,1,0,14
"Ordered these shoes in black with white tread and logo and received black on black. But the size was correct, and I think I prefer the black on black so I'm not too upset.",3,0,14
They sent me the wrong color twice. I love these sneakers. They are very comfortable and I have multiple pairs. Twice I received a pair that I already had.,1,0,14
"Couldn't figure out how to tie them without the laces, not too good for working out.",1,0,14
"Despite having followed Amazon.com's instructions regarding sizing, it is not as reliable. I wear US 9.5 with Nike, and it was supposedly the same size with these Adidas ... No, they were a little big. Nothing that does not solve thick socks, it is not as big as unwearable... not that much. But that was not expected ...",3,0,14
It's was a great shoe but only lasted a few walks. I liked the concept of these laces but they have a major flaw. One of the hoops that holds the laces broke and I've had the shoes for only a few weeks. What are you supposed to do once that breaks? Makes me wish I bought a shoe with regular laces.,1,0,14

Showed up on time everything is perfect they just don’t look the way I thought they would and me.. they’re kind of cheesy shoes and they sit kind of low on your ankle lower than you would think,3,0,14

Need to exchange still... The one thing I hate about online shopping,1,0,14
These shoes were really comfortable from first fit but the quality is poor. I received my pair in January and they are already shredding. They started a month in and now are almost too bad to wear. Not worth the money. A casual shoe shouldn't fall apart after a month from casual use especially $70 ones.,2,0,14
Never will I buy a all white pair of shoes again. Just have these if you are a sneaker head and only wear twice a month or they are destroyed!,3,0,14

I really wish there was a way to tighten up the laces a bit on these shoes.,2,0,14
Well the shoes are not the correct color I ordered. I ordered the black and white pair but received the all black ones. They fit perfect and are pretty comfortable so that is why they got 2 stars instead of one.,2,0,14

Might be a good conversation starter, though. 🤷‍♂️",3,0,14
If your feet are even slightly wide these will not fit. I got a size bigger because my feet are wider. Skipped them on and immediate pain.,2,0,14
Awful materials and construction... probably the most uncomfortable shoes I have ever owned. Shame on ADIDAS. A month old and used maybe 5 times for a total of 4-5 hours and already look 1+ year old. Bottoms almost worn down already. Total trash and waste of money. Beware!,1,0,14
"I've owned these shoes for 2 months, and they are really comfortable, but sadly after wearing them only about 8-10 times, they are already breaking down. There is a small hole forming on the interior, near the heel of the foot, which has caused me a minor blister, so I won't be wearing these for walking anymore. They are still fine for when riding a bike (since you aren't really moving the shoe much, as it remains flat on the pedal for the most part). Incidentally, this is the second problem I've had with blisters forming due to an Adidas gym shoe, so think I'll be switching brands.",2,0,14
"These shoes are comfortable, I work in a doctor's office so I needed a shoe just like it. The only issue is it seems that there is extra shoe in the front, like it's just a little too long, but I think if I sized down I would not be able to fit it. I purchased these in a men's 8.",3,0,14
I love this shoes and I already own one for almost a year. I decided to add the green color to my collection and to my surprise it came with a rainbow heart on the heel! I don’t like that they never mentioned it in the description. I will have to paint on the heel to be able to use it.,2,0,14

"My son used it for school for may be 3 weeks and it's torn from 2-3 places . Doesn't seem this is the real deal, waste of my money. It's to the point that he can't even wear one shoe since it's totally ripped from the sole",1,0,14

"The product itself is excellent, it is very comfortable, it is literally like walking on a cloud, but the seller sent me a pair of used sports shoes, the sole of the shoe was dirty, I wanted to return it, but my wife checked them carefully, and after cleaning the soles, she convinced me to keep them when she saw that I liked the product itself a lot.",1,0,14

Bought these sneakers for my husband to quick slide on to run errands- these shoes are anything BUT quick to put on. Maybe if the Adidas strap was Velcro but there is no stretch or give. That loop on the back to help you out -won’t last. However after 10 mins once you actually get your foot in- I’m told the sneakers themselves are very light. Meh these shoes don’t really serve the purpose I bought them for.,3,0,14
The style wasn't for me. The extra sole material in back was unsightly. The shoes came to a point in the front and had an oddly Christmas elf look to it.,2,0,14

"I ordered these shoes in black, size 13 (fulfilled by SoleConnect). While the shoes arrived quickly, they are nowhere near a size 13. My husband already owned these shoes so based on my pictures, you can see that the sizes are NOT the same. The grey ones with the white soles are the old pair; the black with black soles are the new pair. The new pair says size 13 and so does the box but they are clearly smaller. I’m assuming that the black ones must be a fake Adidas product. These are going back!",1,0,14
I have ordered Adidas shoes from in-store and have been satisfied. Once I received these in the mail I knew right away that they were not actual Adidas shoes. They are cheaply made and just crappy. I tried them on for the first time and tightened the laces and the lace loops ripped from the shoes. I did not even wear them for a run or a walk. I am disappointed that this stuff even exists in the marketplace. I hope to find some REAL Adidas shoes.,1,0,14
"These shoes are light and very comfortable for walking and light running. However, the bottom treads are not durable at all. The attached picture shows the significant wear that occurred after ~65 miles of outside walking over 35 days. The top portion has worn down enough that a shallow puddle will seep water into the shoe. These shoes will probably last longer if you do your walking on an indoor track or treadmill. However, pavement/asphalt/gravel, especially if warm, eats the soles up.",2,0,14
"The soles of these shoes are quite squishy. I am not sure how it happened, but the soles started to become permanently compressed on the inside heel. Soon the shoes started to wear unevenly in that direction. Before I knew it I would catch myself walking with my ankles collapsed in and started to feel Valgus knee pain. This was with a Dr. Shoals insert as well. I have never had this happen with any other shoes and I swapped these out with a pair of new balance with a harder rubber sole and the ankle collapse immediately went away. Also, there is no tongue to these shoes, and it was tight around the tops of my feet.

That said, I am 6'6"", about 275 pounds, and I workout a lot. Perhaps it was more my weight that caused the soles to compress and turn in more than it being a design flaw. But I would caution against these for anyone on the heavier side to avoid ankle and knee issues.",3,0,14
"I own a size 11 pair that I bought on the store. I bought this one exactly the same model and color, just to replace my worn out one.

The shoes I received besides being the same size number as my old one was physically bigger than the one I bought in the store and didn't fit correctly.

The rubber sole was stiff and actually hurt my feet, far from the characteristics of an Cloudfoam sole that usually makes you feel you are stepping in marshmallow.

Not sure if it was just a defective unit, but be aware.",1,0,14
"These are really nice and stylish shoes. Very comfortable for casual wear and walking. Areas where I had trouble was the lack of arch support and impact support while running on pavement. I've been using normal arch support from most shoes and this one was pretty flat. Also, the padding/cushions on the soles did not absorb as much shock as other shoes I've had. Basically after a couple of runs trying out the shoes started to get shin splints because of the lack of cushioning and arch support. I still do really like the shoes for walking and casual wear, but won't be using these for running on pavement.",2,0,14
"I usually wear an 11. I ordered these in an 11 and the fit was fine. These are nice and light weight. They are good for running. Because of the foam sole they are not good for cross training or weight training. As seen in the picture he back of the show has two tabs. One of the tabs projects about an inch from the shoe, which looks odd and not necessary. The body of the shoe is more of a sock, it fits very snug on the upper foot. One things I did not like was the laces. The laces don’t actually make the shoe any tighter. There is no tongue and the show is not cut down the middle. I wear these jogging without the laces. Better shoes out there.",2,0,14
Returned them! The tongue is sewed into the sides of the shoes making the entrance holes for a child’s sue size! I ordered and received the 11.5D to replace the cloud soft shoes that look identical in the photos! However I could not get my foot into the shoe so I returned them! If you have very small feet they may fir you but I cannot recommend them for any adult!,1,0,14
"worst designed shoe ever! There is no tongue or any way to open where the foot goes in. It is waaaaaaaay to small for an ordinary foot to fit into and you can't even force it. If someone can get their foot inside, the shoe MUST be waay to big.",1,0,14
"I have an administrative job. I wear these in the office, and the plant. They are nice, however, these are not authentic. Ive been buying these shoes for years now. Not from here, but from an actual store. They are not the same. The writing on the foam is clearly different. They did not come with an authentic cloud foam tag. Lastly, the foam is a great deal cheaper than the authentic shoes. The shoes are definitely comfortable, just not authentic. Not worth 100$ when you can buy the AUTHENTIC ones in the store for 79- 69 depending the color. Since the virus i had to buy online. Shoes are fine. But ill get the real deal in the stores next time",3,0,14
I bought these shoes for my son to replace a similar pair. He has worn this style of Adidas for several years and loves them for their comfort. Usually they last around 9 to 12 months. We have had this pair for six weeks and they already have holes in them. He wears them to school 3-4 days per week and occasionally to play tennis. We are very disappointed with this pair!,2,0,14
"Too flimsy and light for running. I'd prefer running shoes to have more sole and cushion, besides being a tad bit heavier. These are light and make a clapping sound on every step.

I should also mention that the laces are aesthetically present and disappointing as I couldn't secure a custom fit, but that's the tradeoff between decent running shoes and slip-on sneakers. I would not recommend for running, and wouldn't buy had i known these were slip-ons.",2,0,14
This shoe looks great but it runs WAY too big. All of my son's various types of shoes are size 11 and we have never had a problem until now with ordering him shoes online. We tried exchanging the size 11 for a 10 and even the 10 was much too big. It wasn't worth the hassle to try a 9 so we returned the shoes. Too bad because my son liked the looks of the shoe and said they were comfortable. Wondering why a big name company like Adidas makes a shoe that is so completely off with the sizing.,3,0,14
"These must be knock offs.
Wore them 3-4 days a week to work and to put around the yard for approx. 60 days.
The sole is completely worn through. Amazon will not return them. They are complete trash. In the garbage they go. Very disappointing.",1,0,14
"The left foot shoe, the sole came loose from the upper in two spots, I am 74 years old and have had many pairs of adidas never any problem till now. I am very disappointed in my new shoes, will consider a different brand. Poor workmanship......",1,0,14
"I'm not one to write product reviews, but be warned- you'll probably get a fake pair. The soles are way stiffer than I expected, the laces are horrible quality, and they arrived in a blank box with no indicators of what was inside. I had originally bought these to take to the gym, but having tried that they offer zero support. I ran on a treadmill for only 20 minutes and my toes kept sliding into the front of the shoe.

With that being said they look identical, and for running short errands they're just fine. I'm keeping them, just not for gym use.",3,0,14
"These shoes are very comfortable and I love that they are slip on style type of shoe. The shoe though is a little tighter than I expected, they fit snug on me but if you have a wide or fat feet, these shoes may be too tight on you. I was a little bummed to see these had regular laces as well. I assumed since they were slip on style that the laces were hidden at the top of shoes as in picture. But they are just tucked into the shoe so unless you lace them special you will have to tie your shoe laces like with any other shoe. So I fixed the shoe laces on mine make sure not to wear thick socks and the shoes look and feel great.",3,0,14
"Bought these because the shoes I really wanted weren't available. They are comfortable but have minimal support. What do you expect from a 60 dollar shoe? All I can say is they are comfortable to wear, not to work out, and they look fairly nice. 1year later. These became my go to shoe just to kick around in. After they became broken in I realized how comfortable they were just to wear around the house. They slide on and off almost like a loafer. After one year I'm giving these 4.5 stars.",3,0,14
I have had these shoes for only two months and using them for only taking walks. I noticed the treads wearing pretty quickly but figured that would affect much as they were being used pretty sparingly. Over the last couple of weeks the insoles began to wear and now are pretty deteriorated. I give it another week before they are unusable. I still have my previously shoes that have hundreds of miles on them and do not look half as bad. Unfortunately these fell apart after the return window so I would definitely not recommend them.,1,0,14
"Unconventional construction with no tongue (meaning that the there is no flap between the laces)

We got these October 11th and they are trashed now, the inside cushioning came out and are falling apart. The quality was not what you would expect from Adidas.",1,0,14
"These shoes don’t have arch support, and that’s really important to my feet. 5 stars if they had arch support like most running shoes. Wore them for two days and now afraid they can’t be returned.",3,0,14
"They're comfy and fit well and overall no complaints. Just be aware that in the picture, at least to me, they look black whereas in reality they're navy blue. This is fine, I'm going to keep and enjoy them, in fact I'm wearing them right now.
Just wanted others to know that the ""Ink"" in the name of this shoe refers to blue ink, not black ink as one might expect.",3,0,14
"Nice and light but because it's really a slip-on/slip-off shoe (not a lace-up), it has slipped off my foot when climbing up a grassy slope. So, I don't run with it nor use it for general purpose. It's only good around the house and walking around doing errands. I do not recommend this shoe except for level road runners/joggers. And then, you could save a few grams by removing the unnecessary laces.",3,0,14
"Sole support is thinner than the other cloud foam products they have.

Updated. The cloud foam sole bottoms do not hold up to outdoor running. The bottoms ware very fast. I’m running on bald tires :(. I have 3 pairs of these types of shoes and they all have done the same thing. These would be best for indoor training and maybe predominantly treadmill running.",2,0,14
"I have worn many many different models of Adidas over the last 20+ years - this is the first pair of 10.5 mens that were too big.
I can usually order Adidas with no fear online because I know they will fit. This is the first exception to that rule.
Makes me question if these are real or not. (forgive my worn out shoes... I love my dids - from left: samba, nizza canvas hightop, gazelle, lite racer byd) Note how much bigger the new one on the far right runs.",1,0,14
These ripped from just normal everyday wear very quickly and the fabric is not able to be repaired.,1,0,14
"Nice looking shoe. Comfortable and light. The uppers are elastic which make it great for easily slipping on and off.
On the downside, the elastic doesn't provide any support. I never thought uppers provided any useable support however when your feet aren't held in place relative to the sole it gets really noticeable.
That said, it's decent as a casual shoe but definitely not for any sort of athletic activity.",3,0,14
"If you’re going to buy a pair of these, be careful!! Don’t remove any tags/stickers before trying them on. I made the mistake of doing this before finding out that these shoes are NOT labeled correctly. There’s absolutely no way these are size 10.5! I’ve never had an issue with shoe sizing from adidas. I’ve always been fine with 10.5 these shoes are more than likely .5 off. Making them an 11 instead of 10.5 Another user got a pair that was too small. The shoes are great otherwise. I guess I’ll just deal with it since I really don’t feel like waiting for the whole exchanging.",3,0,14
My son has had these for 2 months and they are falling apart already. Really disappointed in the quality of these!,1,0,14
"This is not a workout shoe at all. More like a casual shoe to wear every day. Very comfortable to walk in. If you are purchasing just for walking around it is a 5! If you plan to workout using this shoe, i would recommend a better quality shoe for working out.",3,0,14
"These were very comfortable shoes at first, but only lasted about 35 miles of walking/running before the traction was worn. Now I have to be careful anytime the pavement is wet. Like a lot of clothing/shoe items I buy on Amazon, these are not the same build quality or material of the same product you find in a store.",2,0,14
"The outsoles are made of foam-like plastic that are prone to faster wear and tear. This makes them pretty comfortable yet not practical. This material cannot be rigid enough to have traction when you need it.

If you want to spend money on a shoe that already feels like all the treading is worn away, this is the shoe for you. If you want to slide around corners like some looney toons skit, here you go.",1,0,14
"I liked the old cloudforms and ran hundreds of miles in my last pair over the last 7 mos. This pair is similar, but has these dumb ""boot straps"" on the back. I cut them off with a razor knife easy enough, but it was a dumb addition. If these are ""racing"" shoes.. less is more.",3,0,14
It’s a bit of a tight fit when other 9.5 shoes fit me more loosely. Also I was under impression it was a slip on but it’s a lace up. Not quite as sturdy as I thought either. Looks good,3,0,14
"These shoes are great except for one fatal flaw: The in-step is so much narrower than the rest of the shoe. This is pretty common for running shoes, EXCEPT the in-step curves in so the outside of your foot is over-supported and inside is not supported at all. I'll wear these around the house but not much else.",3,0,14

overall adidas tends to run large . these dont have true laces nor tongue so cannot make them snugger around feet if desired like a traditional sneaker. was difficult to see that on my phone when ordering. these should feel good on wider feet. have the great soft foam footbeds if you need cushion from hard floors or just long hours on your feet. i wont recommend for a narrow foot cuz if you try to tighten laces then fabric bunches up and doesnt look good.,3,0,14
"The knit upper can take punishment no problem, the problem is with the outsole, I wore this as a daily shoe for work and after 8 months the outsole was gone and I was slipping on all types of smooth surfaces and even textured surfaces if they were wet.",3,0,14
we bought these for our son. He has been wearing these for 6 weeks and they look terrible! The tread is almost gone and the fabric looks bad. He doesnt run track or anything they just dont seem to be made very well. If I get more adidas i will for sure get a differtent style,1,0,14
"Shoes looks great my 11 year old loved them, but we got them on 9-23-21 and the toe is already gone in them. It is 11-5-21. There is no way I have found to get in touch with the seller or Amazon as the return date has past.",1,0,14
"I really liked these right out of the box. Super comfy. I have had them now for a couple of months and the soles feel like they will only last a couple more. I have not run in them, but I suspect you would get very little mileage from them. Too bad that by just walking in them they feel like they are not going to hold up.",3,0,14
Comry but not really a running sneaker in the support sense also the sole is already wearing out. I've barely had it maybe 5 weeks,3,0,14
"Very comfortable, but has an o.Odd lacing configuration makes these shoes difficult to lace up. Weak support. Better for casual walks or wearing around the house, but not for workouts.",3,0,14
Returned these. Felt more like socks. I do mostly jogging/sprinting intervals and I felt like there was zero support.,1,0,14
" These are some comfortable shoes but I’m not sure how long the tops will last. They are thin. Like socks thin. Every step you can see your toes move. If that’s what you are looking for, you found it.",3,0,14
I’m actually disappointed I can tell that these shoes were worn by someone else and the box was raggedy as well. There wasn’t even wrapping paper between them in the box or any inside the shoes. I would send them back but I really wanted these so I’ll clean them myself and order shoes from Nike next time.,1,0,14
"I got a 10 1/2 which were too big but the 10 was too small. Not impressed with the shoes over time. They started out nice, with great cushion but it didn’t last long. I wouldn’t recommend for running. Didn’t last as long as I would’ve hoped.",2,0,14
"I walk 1 mile everyday after work and I walk around quite a bit at work even for an office job.
4 months to the day and these are completely trashed. The inside sole part fell out and was barely even there anymore.
If I lift my big toes up they will be exposed because the fabric part ripped.

And all I do is walk......... for the price I'm disappointed they couldn't last longer than 4 months. Honestly i can't find any manufacture make a shoe for a regular person like me that lasts more than 4 months. Hundreds of dollars all the time for shit these days.",3,0,14
"The sole of this shoe is just a foam material, there's no rubber or grip on the bottom. It fit well and looked nice, but I ended up returning because I don't think it's last very long.",3,0,14

"Stylish and a good shoe for lifting, but the souls wear out far too quickly for daily use. After light-moderate use for a year the shoelaces started to fray, the fabric was already peeling, and the bottom of the shoe were worn around the balls of the feet and heel. I'd consider another product.",2,0,14
"So...my son loves this style and the shoes fit and are comfortable...however, they seem to be defective. The toe kicks are not the same size. The company offered a return/exchange, but I waited too long to buy my son new sneakers and I can’t have him wearing his good shoes while we wait for an exchange to happen. It’s a bummer. I wish they had listed them as defective and priced them accordingly.",2,0,14
"I've had the shoes for two months and only wear them for walking. I have other sneakers I use for exercising since my foot slides around too much in these. I'm very disappointed that the inside of the back of the shoe has formed a hole that now hurts when I walk. I understand that at some point they would wear out, but two months is just too fast. I would not recommend buying these.",1,0,14
My foot slides in them when I try to run. The tongue isn’t like a separate part of the shoe as most shoes. Its very hard to tighten the laces because of this. When you tighten them it just makes it tighter at the top of the ankle. They are ok for just walking in but that’s not why I bought them,1,0,14
"not comfortable at all, there are narrow and i have narrow feet",2,0,14
"The shoe tread is almost non existent. I don't see how these are considered running shoes. Looks like you overpaid just for a brand, when you can find the same shoes at Burlington, or Marshall's.",1,0,14
These seem like knock-offs. The bottom of soles are very cheap.,3,0,14
Shoe looked great but was too narrow. We wear adidas because we have wider feet and most shoes are too narrow.,3,0,14
The shoes are a great low cost option that you’ll likely have to replace quickly if heavily used. I would give this product a 5-star rating for a price that is $20 cheaper as they are clearly an “adidas” knockoff and subpar quality compared to name brand running shoes.,3,0,14
"Super light weight, athetically pleasing. If your kid is active like mine (soccer,track, always on the go). These wear out quick. Probably a good shoe for just average wear.",3,0,14

"I am a huge fan of Sambas, and I have been wearing them for years. About two years ago, I ordered a pair from Amazon, and they were great - the same, true product I had been ordering from the corporate Adidas website. However, I was not as satisfied this time around. Immediately upon opening the box, I knew these weren't the same shoes I had previously ordered, even though the page indicated that I had ordered the same item previously.

Appearance: The glue around the sole that attaches it to the leather boot/sock of the shoe is sloppy, chunky, and visible. The sole itself is a totally different ""gum"" color than the previous pairs I own. I realize the color changes over time, but I have not ever owned a pair whose sole was very dark brown. Some of the eyelets for the shoelaces are not completely punctured, indicating poor factory quality. I would most likely need to stab a knife through the unpunctured eyelet to make way for the laces, but since I intended on returning them I did not do this. Finally, the leather looks incredibly cheap and plastic-y.

Fit/Feel: As soon as I tried the shoe on, I knew it was not the same shoe I have been wearing for years. I have broken in SO many pairs of Sambas, so I am aware that they fit a bit differently when they are new, but these ones felt like stiff, sharp, plastic socks. I have been wearing the same size, 8.5, for 20 years, and the arch on this shoe did not fit in the same spot on my foot as all of my other ones. Also, these ones felt narrower (mostly by the pinky toe) than my other pairs. I have pretty narrow lady feet (which is why I like this style of shoe), so it's rare when I find a shoe that is too narrow for me. These shoes definitely feel like a knock-off. I am just going to pay the extra money and order directly from Adidas.",2,0,14
"These are NOT AUTHENTIC Addidas! They arrived in an box that looked authentic, but the shoe inside definitely WAS NOT. My husband has authentic Addidas and I bought him the exact same shoe as a replacement, and these do not even come close to the real thing. The tongue is not leather but a weird foam, I assume because that's where the logo goes?? The gum sole was not correct either; completely different color and texture than the real thing. I do not recommend purchasing, especially when authentic Addidas are only around 10 bucks more.",1,0,14
Very disappointed. The sole of the shoe fell apart the third time I wore them. The circle tread on the bottom of the right shoe ripped out completely. I had Sambas before that lasted years. These lasted 2.5 indoor soccer games. I would like to return them but it's too late. I will not purchase another pair from Amazon. I will buy my next pair from a local shop in hopes that they will take a return if this is a problem with adidas manufacturing.,1,0,14
"Like others have noted here, the newer Sambas seem to have a problem with the circular part of the sole below the ball of the feet. I've worn Sambas for years without issues. I ordered a new pair and immediately noticed the rubber of the sole seemed darker and less pliable. When I wore them to the gym for the first time, at the very start of a cone sprint exercise I stepped on something rubbery. When I went back to look I realized it was a big chunk of my shoe. On my next turn, the other shoe blew out. I had worn these all of 10 minutes to that point.

My previous shoes, ordered about a year earlier had the same problem but it took a bit longer than a day to present itself.

I have ordered a replacement pair, but should these also fail it may be time to move on to another brand.

Update 12/11/2018: New shoes, same problem. I put another pair into use in August and by early December the sole on one of them had blown out in the same place they all blow out. I only use these for weightlifting and basic floor exercises, and as you can see from the pictures the rest of the rubber is barely worn. The rest of the shoe seems to be fine, but the circles are a definite weak spot that negate the otherwise fine quality. On to another shoe/brand for me...",1,0,14
"Once liked this model but as some have noted they appeared to have changed the leather, it feels more plastic.
The worse part is the rubber they use for the sole, it squeaks badly on tile and many other surfaces, this drove me nuts fast.
I wanted to love them again but I just can't.
Oh, the arches seem higher as well and they glue the insole to the bed so you practically need to tear the shoe apart if you want to replace it something else.",2,0,14
"I purchased these because my current Sambas are getting a little worn. And, wow, I'm extremely disappointed because I have a strong, strong hunch these are knock-offs. If they are real, Adidas have gone significantly downhill. I returned my pair after spending about 10 minutes with them.

* The leather isn't leather at all - it's 100% vinyl. Even the Samba Vegan model has a better look than the flat-looking, textureless vinyl on these.
* The outsole/bottom of the shoes I received wasn't the typical brown, but a dark gray, almost black.
* The tongue was hilariously long (going above my ankle when worn) and was made of some weird foam (instead of leather). None of Adidas' shoes (from their website) represent the same pattern or length.
* The arch was excessively, uncomfortably high. No pair of store-bought Adidas I have ever owned felt like this.
* Even the stitching on the outside of the shoe, while close, doesn't match the patterns on Adidas' website.

Buyer beware. This is not the Adidas I know and love.",1,0,14
"At first , I was excited to get these shoes again..upon receiving them, I immediatley noticed that they are not authentic. What gave it away was the shoe laces hole was double punched and the material was not leather. They didn't even make it on my feet from how obvious this was. I don't understand how Amazon lists this items and doesn't even notice that these are knock offs and not genuine. They should have a quality control department monitoring items as such since it is ""fufilled by Amazon."" Either way, I sprung for the $20 dollars and ordered the real ones. These are on their way back to Amazon.",1,0,14
"I have used Adidas Sambas for at least 30 years and the shoes used to be very comfortable and lasted for many years, but during the last year and a half I have purchase 3 pairs and I could not understand why they were falling apart so quickly and most of all why my feet were hurting so much.... Well, finally I figure out that it was not just me, but the quality of the shoes is horrible and they are narrower so that is why my feet are hurting so much when wearing this shoes.... Well I guess this is GOOD BYE to Adidas....",1,0,14
"I used to buy Sambas & other Adidas sneakers in Paris every few years, visiting family, because my foot is a perfect 41 EU Size, which isn’t sold in the US. Hello Covid! No travel. No sneakers. For real no sneakers, not just no perfectly fitting sneakers. Because American Adidas? Are constructed of the WORST craptastic materials (a plastic tongue? Really??? Just…no. And why are pieces of this shoe glued together rather than stitched???.), and the quality control at whatever factory is being used is nonexistent. Lumpy, mismatched, substandard, pinching, loose, torn.. in the same pair! Much less line 3 pairs up together.. I’m shocked and appalled Adidas would put their name on this junk, much less stamp them as Sambas. I thought, perhaps, these were cheap knockoffs so I went to a local shoe store, and nope. These… things… are the “real” deal. At least as far as their American market.

Hard pass. I love Adidas Sambas too much to compromise. Real leather. Real gum sole. Real stitching, with real thread. I’ve seen cheap knockoffs that do a better job at mimicking Sambas than Adidas does with their American market shoe. Maybe Canada gets the real thing. It’s worth a 2 hour drive to find out!",1,0,14
"I tried really hard to make these shoes work. I first wore the size 7 in black (I typically wear a women's size 8.5-9)- purchased from Academy. I tried the 7.5 on in the store and my heel slipped in them no matter how tight I tied them, so I went with the 7. They felt okay walking around other than the high arch support and a tad bit tight in the toe box, but during my soccer game I lost both of my big toenails (I have no idea... I have never had this happen). So I attributed it to my shoes being too small, even though they didn't really feel all that small. Fast forward- I decided to give the size 7.5 another chance and purchased from this seller because they were cheaper than box stores. During my soccer game, my feet were constantly cramping up to the point that I had to come off the field and take them off for a second just to get some relief. Also, at one point, my left shoe slipped off in the middle of play. I tried breaking them in by walking on the treadmill at the gym with the same result- constant cramping. I removed the arch support as others stated on here... still uncomfortable. I even trimmed the insoles so that there is less of a ""hump"" aka Adidas idea of ""arch support,"" but my feet still cramped up after wearing them for just a few minutes. I also cut the tongues down because they drove me crazy (I used to tape them down, but for some reason it is uncomfortable on these shoes). Anyway, I performed 3 different surgeries on this shoe to no avail, so I have essentially wasted $130 on 2 pairs
of the most uncomfortable shoes in the history of all time.",1,0,14
"So, I bought these shoes to ride my mountain bike in as I wanted an alternative to mtb shoes which aren't that attractive. I've worn Sambas for yeeears.
They look great, fit well...Basically... Sambas but for some reason these ones have an incredibly chemical smell (Acrid like burning rubber) to them. I noticed it slightly when I first got them, even before I opened the box so I figured I'll just air them out. Seemed to improve. First time I wore them when we got to the halfway point of the trail and everyone took a breather someone asked what the hell was that smell and I realized it was the shoes. Let's just say I couldn't take them off when we got back to the truck.
This time when I got home I actually had to leave them outside. After a day they were still reeking so I figured my only option was to scrub and wash them as I had worn them so figured I couldn't return them(they were muddy...it's MTB)
After washing, drying and airing the smell was faint. I decided to take them for a short walk. By the time I got back they were stinking again and so were my feet. They're basically unwearable but have been worn and washed so I can't return them. I've owned over 10 pairs of Sambas and never had this issue. I even bought a white pair the same time as these and they're perfectly fine. It's bizarre. I plan to contact Amazon but I don't think they can do anything about it.
I'll update if they do",2,0,14
"I used to wear these during residency exclusively in the ER. Cool style and comfortable. The new darker soles are a change for the worse to me and need to go back to the gum rubber color sole. The long tongue has also become something I don’t want to deal with and it makes zero sense to have to pay $30 more or really any price more for the standard tongue. I also appreciate the adjustment suggestions but don’t want to go through the hassle of making my own cut and attach adjustments. So for now, I’m going with the Puma Super Liga, Solid alternative.

I use these for a little light soccer and juggling and walking around town. Would love to get back into them but I’ll need those changes mentioned above to go back.",3,0,14
"I have worn Samba's for years, and it was time to get a new pair. When I opened the package I was expecting to see the usual blue box with white stripes, but that was not meant to be. The shoes came in a gray box and said ""End Plastic Waste."" These were not the Sambas I was expecting.

After doing some searching I was left more confused than I was when I opened the box. The suede felt different than my others, but was that because these were new? The sole is a a darker shade than my other pairs as well.

After doing some internet research, I could not come to a conclusion on these shoes. Adidas has shoes on their website made of Vegan materials in their ""Made of Recycled Content"" line, but that has a gray suede front, and this pair says they are made of leather.

At this point, I have not tried them on, so I am reserving final judgement. I will be updating in the future when I know more about how they fit and feel. They are supposedly Sambas, so I am expecting the customary break in period before they are truly comfortable. Others have stated these do not last as long as well; I honestly couldn't tell you the last time I bought a pair. My current pair is at least three years old; hopefully the new pair lasts that long.",3,0,14
"I live in Japan. Father from United States bought me a amazon gift card. Unfortunately, I cannot use the USA amazon gift card here in Japan. Separate company.

Whatever. So, I ordered these shoes, have the same exact ones from 5 years ago. Old shoes fit perfect but I wanted new ones that weren’t falling apart. Same size. Same color. Same style.

I ordered these on USA amazon and the item is not as depicted. Too tight, stabbing pain in the sides. I even tried longer laces to loosen up the uncomfortable tightness. Still blisters.

Unfortunately, since I live in Japan... the return process is unfair. Amazon will only refund 15.00 $ usd to return the item back to the USA... it costs 9000¥ to ship the item back to the USA for some item that is defective.
Now I’m stuck with defective shoes in Japan, that I paid for on a USA amazon Gift card. I’m not sure why amazon USA doesn’t have an option to return the item to Japan Amazon warehouse. It’s very stressful and very unprofessional of a business to practice this nature.",1,0,14
"Being on a budget but looking for a good affordable shoe in the brand that I like, this one caught my eye. Not too pricey I decided to give it a shot.

My first impressions : I LOVE the look of the shoe, matches well with my style and the brand that I enjoy, price range good but you'll get what you pay for.

Comfort : Overall the shoe fits great, enough space although my only 2 gripes with this product are that it absolutely lacks sole, worn these for a week now and the bottom of my feet are hurting, not enough cushioning for my taste especially if you're up on your feet all day like I am. I'm already looking at replacing the sole and seeing if that will make a difference. Secondly I dont like the material the shoe tongue is made out of, it feels like a cheap foamy material that will most likely rip later after some wear and tear. I'll be sure to update later down the line, other than that maybe next time I'll just look for a shoe with a similar style and just pay the extra 15-20 dollars. Not bad if you need something stylish but willing to sacrifice a bit of comfort in the sole area.",3,0,14
"I’ve been wearing Sambas for 25 years. I buy a new pair every couple of years. The pair I received was nothing like what I remember. The gum soles are an odd color and the whole shoe just feels cheap. I went to Dicks Sporting Goods to look at their selection of Sambas. They looked just as bad as the pair I received from Amazon. It looks like after many decades of building a quality, inexpensive shoe Adidas has decided to cheapen this one. Time to look elsewhere.

- Gum soles are a weird dark eggplant color
- Some of the eyeholes aren't punched all of the way through
- Leather feels cheap and plastic-like",1,0,14
"I have been wearing Sambas for more than 20 years. Back in the day when you could grab them from Sports Authority for $20 these shoes were indestructible. I could easily wear a single pair everyday for a year without incident. Now I buy TWO pairs of these for $60 each, wearing them in alternation, and the inner backs of all four shoes have completely torn away into the cap/frame (see image). What happened???",1,0,14
"Arch support is too high and is very uncomfortable. The first day I wore them it was noticeable but not uncomfortable, but the second day they were really uncomfortable after being on them for about 5 hours. I stand all day, so I was hoping for comfortable shoes. If you're not on your feet all day they might be fine.
Someone on here said you could remove the insoles which helped but they're still a bit uncomfortable. I put flatter memory foam in but they still feel weird. With no insole they're ok. But because these are made to be light, there isn't a lot of cushion. Really disappointed in that regard.
That said, they're really cute and I'm still keeping them.",3,0,14
"I've been wearing Sambas my entire life, but these aren't the OG's. These showed up with black bottoms, and not the classic gum-bottom color, so that's a red flag. Upon a quick search or two on Adidas & soccer.com, it seems all the original Sambas are sold out right now (except for tiny sizes). Also, wearing them around the house, my heal slips with every step. It's not the classic fit, the material is almost slicker. I will always be a fan of the classic Sambas, but I did not receive the right pair.",3,0,14
"Although this is advertised for futsal I definitely do not suggest so. For whatever reason the cushion inside the shoe is lifted on the inside to support the arch but it's lifted so much it started to hurt right after a few changes of direction. I never before these had blisters on my arch, an unpleasant feeling I do not wish on any player. Adidas makes some nice shoes, these are not one of those.
I was going to return them but let too much time pass by. If you try them and feel pressure on your arch, return immediately",2,0,14
"***FAKE BEWARE***

These arrived in a non-descript box. Not an Adidas box. Tags that are on the shoes also don't reference Adidas anywhere (see attached picture) After trying them on, they were too large...which is odd because I've had the same size Samba's before and they fit great.

It's unfortunately past my due date to return, so they'll go to charity and I'll go directly through Adidas to purchase.",1,0,14
"Really not the same soft, comfortable fit. These are hard and stiff. I pulled off the ridiculous white stick-on arch support under the insole out and cut around the arch support in the insole. Much better. Very last pair of Sambas. Sad to see an era go away. I had dozens of pairs of Sambas - I wish I kept them!",1,0,14
A little dissappointed...they feel fine and i wear them but the pics of the show show the sole as brown and I thought that was interesting and thats the reason I purchased them. Sadly in real life when inspected closely they are brown...but such a dark brown they just seem black. I wouldn't have purchased them if I knew they looked the way they did. Other than that they seem to be a good comfortable shoe.,3,0,14
This is a complete misrepresentation of a Real adidas Samba. I've bought real leather Sambas. Amazon advertised REAL LEATHER. This shoe was 100% not leather. All man made material. I had to send it back. Come on Amazon you can do better.,1,0,14
"Sorry but everyone who purchased these sneakers have just paid $60 for a $15 knockoff. Just scroll through the pics that others have taken and compare for yourself. Inconsistencies in the font, the stitching, the sole material and the quality in the leather and suede. Totally inferior product. Go to Adidas.com and look at genuine sambas. Take a look at the font. These have a taller ""squished"" together looking font. Notice the stitching. The stitch that wraps around the stamped name is very rounded. The stitch on a real pair is nearly a 90 degree turn. The color and ""feel"" of the sole ""rubber"" is not right. Overall shape is off. Real Adidas would not have all these inconsistencies. Buy authentic Adidas directly from their website or at least know what to look for. Compare for yourself and make a educated purchase.",1,0,14
"For the price, I can't really complain. I've had this pair of Sambas for over a year and they've held up well, but there were a few things I'd caution potential buyers on:

1. The pair I received are not authentic Adidas Sambas and are cheap knock-offs
2. The first month or so wearing these shoes out of the box was pretty uncomfortable as the sole insert in the shoe felt super high and it took a while for it to mold to the actual shape of my foot
3. The shoes are not well ventilated / breathable and very soon after purchase, I noticed a horrendous smell coming out of these shoes. I've never had issues with foot odor before and these are the only pair of shoes I own where I have this issue. It's pungent to the point that people across the room would be able to smell it. I've tried multiple remedies, such as washing the shoes, using baking soda, etc. and didn't have any luck.

For the above reasons, I will be throwing these shoes away. I recommend spending the extra money to get a real pair of Adidas Sambas.",2,0,14
"Just got these - immediately noticed that the sole of the shoe is not the classic brown as shown in the product images but BLACK. I don't mind and will keep them, but odd and NOT what I ordered.
Quality and construction seems legit. For some reason the insoles have an extremely high arch which may end up hurting my flat feet. Will see as time goes on, I may have to replace the insoles which is annoying. I've had Sambas before and they were much flatter inside.
I'm a 10.5 typically but my last Sambas at 10.5 left me with a little room which wasn't ideal for playing soccer in. I got these at a half size down, so a 10, and they fit kind of perfectly snug. If I was just wearing casually I may opt for the 10.5 for some extra room and comfort, but these work for me.",3,0,14
"These are just not comfortable. The arch inside is very high which has no cushion, if that’s what you expect than you’ll like them. The other feature here is a very long tongue, they are almost like a shin guard, making it uncomfortable to wear pants. Again if that is what you want then you’ll love these. For me it was like wearing a really bad French Kiss on my ankles, way too much tongue for me. Instead I bought the originals directly from Adidas, with the blue label on the tongue, and those I love.",3,0,14
"Obviously counterfeit. Shoes are not leather, gum sole is wrong texture and color and not stitched to shoe. Tongue is not leather and some strange feeling foam material. Box is not blue.",1,0,14
These are not authentic. Poor quality fakes nothing like what I have had in the past. Sizing is way off. Hard fake leather upper with a suede toe cap.,1,0,14
"Wow, the quality of these really went down hill. These are the 5th pair I have bought. They are the only shoes I have worn for many years but these are WAY different then they used to be.

The are stiff, bulky, and the soles squeak like crazy. They honestly feel and look like knock offs.",1,0,14
"Cheap knock offs, for the third time. Amazon is refusing to refund me, so I’m stuck with junk",1,0,14
I've been buying Sambas for 35 years and whatever they did to it this time around I'm not impressed with at all. Hard to describe but I don't like the fit. I've had them for about 6 months now and they should be well broken in at this point but I get blisters on medium length walks. Still go to my old pair for long walks. After 35 years I'm probably going to need to check out other options.,2,0,14
"I used to love my Adidas Sambas, so I bought a new pair. Either these aren’t the classics or they’ve really changed them. There’s no arch. The shoes look okay; walking in them I found myself curling my toes to force an arch. Not for me anymore I guess.",2,0,14
"Indoor soccer shoes are the best for table tennis. I bought these because of the medium/low price tag. The tongue is huge and absolutely destroyed my ankle after 4 hours of play while I was wearing short socks, to the point where it completely scabbed up by the next morning. Hoping higher socks will take care of that problem. Probably a non issue for soccer players though. They look great. The fit is a little big which I had read in other reviews so I ordered a size 10 instead of 10-1/2, so go a half size down and you'll be fine. The grip is good as expected. My next show purchase will be something different.",3,0,14
"I have worn Sambas religiously since 1995. I LOVE them. My third pair is wearing thin in the sole after 8 years of constant wear, so I thought I'd order a replacement pair. These are horrendous. I'm pretty sure they're fake. I really hope they're fake because I can't believe Adidas would downgrade their classic shoe so drastically. They're made of some sort of plasticky faux leather, and the sizing is about a half size too big. I'm returning these and headed to a shoe store. More money, but at least they'll be leather.",1,0,14
"LOVE the look, but I can't find a pair wide enough for my (not particularly tall or wide!) feet. I'm happy to break in the leather, but this kind of side overhang is just ouch. Guess I wear EEs in Sambas, which don't exist as far as I can tell. Bummer. Puma Super Liga OGs fit perfectly though.",3,0,14
I have been wearing sambas for 30 years. Did Adidas decide to change the look of the shoe after all these years? They may be comfortable but I am not even trying them as I am looking for what I am used to and what is in the picture. The sole is close to black as opposed to the tan. I am going to look elsewhere for what I expect.,1,0,14
"I'm a solid nike 11.5, converse chuck 11 and these adidas 11.5fit me well, but are on the bigger, loose fitting side. I wouldn't play soccer with the way they are now because they're not snug.
I wore them everyday for many hours standing a work, hoping they would break in and be comfortable, but the arch support and interior of the shoe feels low quality and they really hurt to stand in all day. It just feels lumpy as opposed to conformative or supportive.

I used to have adidas back in the day about 15 years ago and they were very comfortable, but these aren't the most comfortable, though I usually wear them all day anyway.",3,0,14
"The size wasn’t as expected, ordered a 13.5 cause was advised by Amazon suggestions to order a size up, fit snug on sides but was loose all around, I’m hoping that size 13 fits better.. it does but I’m not feeling these shoes. I’m just not sure I’ll let ya know..",2,0,14
"I have work Adidas indoor soccer shoes for a decade or more and always worn an 11. The 11 I received was huge. So I ordered a 10.5. It is pretty much the same size as the 11. I have sent them both back and I give up. (So-called ""First World Problem"" obviously)",1,0,14
I’ve worn Sambas for over 35 years and these are not the same sneakers I grew up wearing. The arch support is ridiculous. Thanks to another reviewer I was able to remove them. What gets me is the length of the tongue. I mean this thing goes halfway up my leg. I just cut off about 2 inches and they are now at least wearable. Do yourself a favor and buy the original Samba soccer sneaker for the extra $30,2,0,14
They are great but was disappointed as the bottoms are not the gun rubber like I was expecting and seeing the pictures. Bought these to replace a pair from 15 years ago that finally gave out.,3,0,14
Tight fit bad for wider feet been painful these last few days don't think i can break these in either. Cheap soles cracked within 3months. Adidas has terrible sole quality for every Adidas I brought the sole would simply wear away in the same area. Whereas nike always fail in the heel before the midtoe area.,2,0,14
I know it’s a classic but changes need to be made. This shoe is too heavy and the arch deforms when I tighten the laces too tight. I feel like Ronald McDonald wearing these. The aerodynamics need updating. A lighter streamlined shoe would be better. Redesign adidas please!,3,0,14
"The size is not according the reference.
I bought a 10.5US but when I try it, it felt like a 11.5 or maybe more. All my sport shoes are 10.5 but this one didn't fit at all.
I don't recommend this product.",1,0,14
"I used to play soccer and have always had a pair of Samba's around. This purchase was to replace my last pair. The quality has gone way down. The last three pairs I've had (each lasting around 6-9 years) were quality. The leather, the soles, the support, all around great shoes. This pair feels like they're made of cheap plether. Everything about these feels poorly made, almost like knockoffs. I may try them again, but I'll never buy another pair online, unless they come directly from Adidas.",2,0,14
"Used to be a good shoe, seems cheaply made now",2,0,14
"Very bad, very cheaply made $50 sneakers",1,0,14
Product is narrow. Insert need to be removed has tall arch. Circle part on bottom of shoe is ripping and have only wore them twice. May be because it's where the shoe bends. Tounge is way bigger than expected. Sfickw out 3 inches up,3,0,14
"I don't know who these shoes fit, but they don't work for me. The shoe constantly comes off my heel, pulling my socks down. The arch is weird and doesn't work. The tongue, what is going on with the tongue? Returning.",2,0,14
"I used to be regular user of Sambas, buying them time and again. After a few years' break, I decided to return because I had always liked the style and comfort. Unfortunately, the shoes have changed. Now, they are far too narrow at the front area around the toes. They are even rather narrow for using in indoor soccer, but for regular day-to-day wear, they are intolerably narrow and I had to return them. It's unfortunate, because the style remains great, but the sizing is just too bad. I'd also add that the arch is a bit excessively large, but that wasn't critical in my decision to return these to the seller.",2,0,14
"I purchased these shoes under same link in 2017. Re-purchased in 2021, and got the cheapest, narrowest version of what the Samba Classic use to be.

Does fit right, looks poorly glued together, sole is completely different material then the 2017 gummy sole.

Returned it and haven't bothered with ordering a size up. No reason, its a garbage quality.",1,0,14
"I got it because it was cheap and I had been going through 2-3 running shoes a year and didn't want to pay the stupid premium for ""women's shoes"". However, there is little in the way of padding, and as is typical for Adidas, they run on the narrow side. They're so thin, I can't add more padding to offset the problem.

I always order shoes based off of their EU size because they always fit.

Or they did. If only they were a bit wider and didn't leave me limping after 2km from lack of padding in the soles and rubbing my pinkie raw. Was the correct length however!

They seem okay wandering about the neighbourhood, though.

Will have to order real running shoes.",2,0,14
"I have been wearing Sambas for about a decade. This was my first order from Amazon instead of from a shoe store. The shoes indicate they are the same size as my old pair but they are a smaller than my previous pair. Wearing for about 6 months and they still feel tighter than my old pair, which are now regulated to grass mowing shoes.

I do not recommend purchasing these.",3,0,14
I bought these in black for the gum bottom and the bottom is actually black as well as the shoe! Not the brown /tan gum colored bottom.,1,0,14
"I've had a few different pairs of sambas over the years, but for some reason the tongue is really long (like a soccer cleat) on these. The arch is also a bit more aggressive than I remember as well.

I also remember my other 2 pairs being pretty durable, these don't seem like they'll last nearly as long. Only time will tell.",3,0,14
"I can’t believe it. They’ve developed a hole on the inner lining after less than a month of wearing these for less than 1 hour a day! They aren’t even my indoor/turf shoes, just casual, everyday kicks. What happened to the quality Adidas Sambas that lasted me all the way through high school? Really disappointing and low and behold, I’m just outside my return window",1,0,14
"The shoes are not wearable due to the security tag being left on the shoes. Unfortunately, it is the type of security tag that you can not remove without special equipment.",1,0,14
Odd shoe. Never had a problem with adidas before. Arch is off. Narrow feeling. Just off. Hurts foot.,1,0,14
"I've owned several pair of this same shoe (same size) , but this pair didn't fit right and fell apart alot quicker.",1,0,14
"I’ve been wearing these for 20 plus years, and always a great shoe. It’s too bad Adidas, for whatever reason, has started making these narrower. Had I known, I would’ve stocked up on the old ones. Could they really be saving that much money? I haven’t decided if I’m going to return or not.",3,0,14
"I had a pair of adidas Sambas a long time ago, which were all nubuck leather. This may be the difference. While these have suede uppers, they just never broke in and always felt way too narrow for comfort, and I have a fairly narrow to normal width foot as well.

Compared to something like the Oniksuka Ultimate 81s these run slightly smaller much more narrow in the toe box and mid-foot areas (for equivalent sizes). I really wanted to like these having worn them before and using other adidas shoes, especially for the price on Amazon, but I ended up giving them away after only a few months of uncomfortable wear.",2,0,14
"Very surprised that after wearing them 2 times, the foam is starting to crumble in the insole. I wondered what the white specks were everywhere. Other than that, they are comfortable shoes. I'll wear them a few more times to see if they hold up.",3,0,14
"Love the quality of these shoes and seem like theyd be very comfortable. But they're at least a half size too small. Ordered 10 1/2 which fits my foot perfectly on almost every shoe I buy. In this shoe, my toes are firmly pressed against the front inside of the upper. Free returns are great but when I went to reorder them, the price was $6 more than what I paid. Buyers should be aware that the front half of the upper (aka toe box) is very narrow and constricting as well. This adds to the overall small size aspect.",3,0,14
To be fair the shoe arrived as expected. The problem is though if you have feet that are a little wider you are plain out of luck. I am hoping because the are leather I can stretch them a bit. The length runs maybe half a size smaller.,3,0,14
"I love this style of shoe and used to wear them when I was younger. The do fit wider than normal, which is what I used to love about them. However, as I have grown, my duck feet have splayed further outward, and I find that these are no longer wide enough. :( Please, Adidas, if you are listening, make my Sambas in Wide and Extra Wide!!!",3,0,14
"My old one is about 4year old, now the threads are almost gone. The new one is different from my old one. Maybe they are produced from a different factory with different materials?? But I remember my old one texture was better, like everything you can buy 4,5 years ago. Not only they were cheaper, but also they feel a little better.",3,0,14
"The description for this shoe says 100% leather, but these are not all leather upper. Only the toe is suede , the rest is plastic/ faux leather. I usually buy straight from Adidas, but tried it here, because the returns are easier. It’s too bad the description was wrong.",3,0,14
Over the last 25 years I have purchased 10-15 pairs of Sambas. This last pair was of poor quality on the footbed. Usually the support is perfect for my feet but this pair was flat. No arch support at all. I hope that this was an anomaly and not a new design. These are going to goodwill.,1,0,14
"The shoes doesn’t feel the same as the same product from footlocker. I don’t know if the product is counterfeit, but it didn’t seem the same. I’ve been wearing adidas sambas for quite a long time and once again this product doesn’t feel the same a store bought shoe.",3,0,14
"Stylish shoe. Unfortunately, very uncomfortable, the arch was way too high.",2,0,14
"These are a men’s 6.5.

I am a women 8.5. I ordered a diff style in men’s 7. Was about a. Size too big so I went down a size, but chose this diff style, sadly these are about a half size too small. If you’re a women’s 8.5 wide I recommend a men’s 7. For proper fit. The tongue on the shoe is super fake feeling, sorry to say. Maybe order adidas from Adidas website.",2,0,14
Worn enough Sambas over the years to know that these are absolutely not legit- Adidas is very consistent with their sizing and these are completely wrong. Very stiff and feel cheaper.,1,0,14
Some of the worst support I have ever had in shoes. Took them off at the end of the day and my heels and arches would ache till the next morning. Had to buy third party soles (which are awesome) and they are my favorite shoes again.,3,0,14
"They put some kind of lump on the arch that kills my feet if I stand in these things for too long. And if I don't sinch the laces just right they end up pinching the tops of my feet. Kinda weird really that a shoe like this that's been around so long has these weird problems with design.
Anyway, in terms of style they can't be beat. So you get a cool look but sacrifice a bit on the comfort front. I'm thinking about getting some new inserts to replace the stock ones. Maybe they'll be better after that.",3,0,14
"Adidas were has the quality gone? Glue was exposed between the shoes and the sole. The sole was already pealing away. These were not even close to being the quality they use to be. Stiff, rough edges, I tried to wear they around the house to break them in but just couldnt bare just walking in them.",1,0,14
"The shoes fitted well and comfortable when the pair was just received, but just after a couple of months the bottom of the right shoe deformed and curled up in the middle and started to hurt my foot. The most walking I had with the shoes was between the train station and my office, which is about 2 miles round trip, and I was just wearing it 2 or 3 days a week so I was very disappointed especially Adidas was not a bad name and so many people gave Samba such a high score.",2,0,14
"Dog hair inside both shoes, disgusting! I both and paid for new but got used.",1,0,14
I like the shoes other than the fact that the sole is brown. I thought they were all black and white.,3,0,14
"These are 100% fakes. Size is way to small then normal, the soles are a very dark brown and made of a very very soft rubber that squeaks. Didn't come with extra laces. Came in a fake black box. Stay away. 100% FAKES...",1,0,14
"Be cautious. Ordered men’s US 10 1/2 and while the shoes themselves are labeled 10 1/2, they are actually like a US 12 1/2 or 13. Had to Return. Probably a simple manufacturing mistake.",1,0,14
Watch out. We definitely received a knock off pair.,1,0,14
I’ve been wearing Superstar’s for decades. I thought these would have a similar feel. They don’t feel nearly as good. They are much narrower and overall not as comfortable. I won’t be buying them again.,3,0,14
I actually purchased this shoe as a gift. She wears an 8.5 in women so I thought this size would fit fine. The issue with this shoe is that it didn't fit true to size. It was small to be a 6.5 Men size. The inseam at the top of the foot is narrow and she said it cinched the back of her foot even with thin socks on (this was after she walked around in them for about 10 minutes). I haven't had any problems with adidas so I tried them on and she wasn't lying. As far as appearance you're definitely getting your classic Samaba!(this shoe has the long tongue also and I did'nt notice that when I purchased them).,3,0,14
"The one star is for Amazon not Adidas.
I love my Sambas and order them regularly until Amazon’s last joke was to ship me some hobo’s old stinky shoes. Not funny. Partly good news is that a replacement is coming fast.",1,0,14
"Just wanted a pair to replace my old faithful Sambas. Price was right, shoe was BS.

Just received my fakes today and the lack of quality in these *new* shoes is blaring.",1,0,14
The image provided via Amazon page shows the sole being a brown color. The one that was delivered to me is all black… not a fan.,1,0,14
"When they arrived, the shoes looked great and seemed to fit just like my previous pair. However, after wearing them once, i began having pain in my arch on the right foot. I examined the show and it appears that the right side shoe is defective as the arch area rises higher than normal and higher than the left show which fits fine. I was unable to wear the shoes again as they hurt my right foot and I was unable to return it as I didn't test them out outside until a month later.",1,0,14
I accidentally bought these shoes instead of the other adidas shoe that looks like these ones. You can definitely tell the difference. These ones are lower quality and the back of the shoe is uncomfortable and annoying when you’re trying to take the shoes off.,2,0,14
Buy half size bigger. Adidas and Puma run small. I made this mistake with this purchase ugh. Too late to return these. Is it? Oh well....,2,0,14
The shoes weren't the best fit but it's wasn't anything too extreme that I had to return them. I did receive the shoes NOT in the original packaging which is never a good thing. They had minor scuffs and scratches I exclusively use them for soccer so it wasn't a big deal but just be warned.,3,0,14
"Good shoes, but to be perfectly honest I have noticed a decline in quality coming from adidas over the last ten years. This is my fourth pair of Sambas and I can tell that they have taken longer to wear in simply because they are uncomfortable enough that I take them off when I get home instead of wearing them all throughout the day like I did with my previous pairs. I can't really say I've ever found a good alternative to the Sambas from other companies. The like-modeled Pumas I had fell apart rather quick and although stiff, these shoes do last a bit longer than other brands.",3,0,14
Too small and uncomfortable. First thing to do is rip out the arch supports. Break them in and maybe you can tolerate wearing them all day. Great for mowing the lawn and abusing in general. I hose them off and leave them outside to dry. That extra long tongue makes me feel invincible to blades of grass that may brush my ankle. All the girls go crazy over them at school so I guess that's cool.,2,0,14
"The young is not stitched leather. It’s some sort of melted foam plastic stuff, and it’s really long. Like freakishly long. I would not mind the length if it was made out of a material that I could have cut and sowed.",3,0,14
Way too narrow in the front. Great looking shoe wish they came in wide.,2,0,14
I love sambas. I have owned several pairs over the years and I like switching back and forth between the mostly black version and this mostly white version. This version of the shoe has not broken in at all over the last year or more that I've owned it. Very disappointing. These shoes usually break in pretty quickly and are very comfortable. This version is not comfortable and squishes my feet (width too narrow). Not sure what changed but I hope I can find the older style for my next pair that I order,3,0,14
"Tongue of shoe rubs up against ankle, and shin area. Even with socks on, it was not pleasant. Returned item.",1,0,14
"The gum is really dark brown, almost black. Not what I ordered or what’s pictured. Real adidas are supposed to come with extra laces, these had none. Definitely knockoffs",1,0,14
"This product was definitely used before. The shipment box the box was damaged, but I think it was used and resold at regular price $50 and the lettering was even wiped away.",1,0,14
Me quedó pequeño porque cometí un error en mi talla en realidad debía pedir talla US 8.5 pero en esta horma soy talla US 8.5,2,0,14
"Second order from Amazon of these. First pair was PERFECT! This second pair was DOA, arch on the right shoe had been bent upward so it stuck into your heel, where the left show was fine. Roll the dice getting these here I'd say.",3,0,14
"The shoes are really big, they do not correspond to the size marked by Adidas.",2,0,14
"It wasn’t a bad shoe, but the first pair I got didn’t fit at all. I returned it and got the exchange almost immediately which was great! But the exchange wasn’t much bigger either, so I returned those as well. I might suggest a size up from usual maybe? But it is a VERY slender shoe.",3,0,14
"Finally wore out my old pair. Thought that a half size bigger would be better on my old feet. Too big. Great free return, but suggestion to swap for next smaller size didn't go through - BECAUSE THE PRICE WAS $10 ABOVE INITIAL PURCHASE. Nope, not doing that. Indoor season nearing end, I'll wait for a sale somewhere else in need be.",2,0,14
these shoes hurt. Not like any Adidas I've ever owned,1,0,14
The pictures are a bit deceptive. There are pictures mixed in with the blue tongue that looks standard. What I received is the long tongue that’s straight black.,2,0,14
"Id return these if I could, they are super narrow! They just sit on my shoe rack and are worthless. Id like my money back as I really dislike these!!!!",1,0,14
"I have had sambar before. There's something ""off"" about this pair.",1,0,14
"This samba classic was ok. however, there is this bulge in the inside of the show that makes my feet uncomfortable. After a couple of hours it could be extremely painful. If you know that, then you'll get what you expected. if you didn't, you will think there was something odd about the shoe. i think that is how they made it. didn't like though.",3,0,14
"I have been wearing sambas for the past 10 years or more. I know what size I wear and I always get these exact same ""samba classic soccer"" shoes. The shoes that arrived were way too large, even though I ordered the same size that I had been wearing. Not sure how or why that happened. Don't order shoes on amazon.",1,0,14
These shows look made from cheap materials,1,0,14
You need to pull out the pad inside the shoe and remove a white foam insert. For some reason Adidas is adding these now and it really makes the shoes uncomfortable. Remove that and the shoe is insanely comfortable,3,0,14
"So like so other reviews, this is my first pair of sambas and they are a little snug. I've always been told I have a narrow foot so it seems strange these fit tight. The length of the shoe is good so I don't want to increase the size and I plan to give these a few weeks to break in and see how they feel. I'm not sure if I can post a follow up review, but if I can I will in a few weeks.",3,0,14
"Purchased as a Christmas gift for my Boyfriend; his usual size(11) was too large but otherwise perfect. I returned those and ordered a half size smaller- at a significant increase in price, no less. We just received the more expensive replacement pair and they had not only obviously been worn but were literally dirty- there were scuffs and dirty marks in several places on both shoes! The first thing I saw when opening the box was the sole of the left shoe, heavily encrusted with what I sincerely hope was mud but may very well have been dog poop!! The fact that the correct size was fifteen bucks more was bad enough but receiving dirty, used shoes- which are badly needed for an indoor soccer game tonight- is just insulting!!!! I have requested a return and will have to wait even longer for a THIRD pair of shoes. And they had BETTER COME AT A DISCOUNT!!!",1,0,14
I have used this style of shoe forany years. I always clean my shoes and when I used some shoe cleaner the name that was written in gold on the sides of the shoe faded so much it's almost unrecognizable.,2,0,14
"I have lots of adidas, these are my least favorite to date. The toe box is narrow and the arch support is too high and stiff. The rubber compound of the soles makes them downright dangerous on wet pavement. Because they are flat, firm and slick, hydro planing is a constant worry. Good luck not hurting yourself in them, somewhat stylish though.",2,0,14
"The only reason I don't like these shoes is b/c I have extremely flat feet. I had no idea there's such a high arch in these. It's almost like I'm standing on a bubble or a small ball. Very uncomfortable. Disappointed b/c I have wanted a pair of these for some time. The size is true, the width is somewhat narrow, and the color and quality is nice.",2,0,14
Uncomfortable shoe. I have an older pair that I love and fit wonderfully. I bought a larger size because it was uncomfortable. My socks are always sliding down in this shoe from the way the heel fits. Awful.,1,0,14
What the heck Adidas? My six year old beaten up Sambas are much more comfortable than a pair that I purchased this month! Why make the toe box smaller?! The shoe was absolutely perfect before but now they are uncomfortable to wear. The fabric by the toe bends into a sharp point and it is kind of painful. I am pretty disappointed actually. I am not the only one who has these complaints either! Plenty of people have been experiencing the same distress. Adidas listen to your customers for goodness sake!,3,0,14
Shoes ran very small for the sizes stated. I normally wear a size 9.5 and I doubt a size 10. would have fit either so I didn't exchange them for a larger size or I would have. The shoes look great. The service from Amazon was again top notch. It's no wonder Amazon leads the E- Commerce industry. Keep up the great work!!!,2,0,14
"Definitely knock offs. Can't tell from the outside. Inside?

"Reddit /r/buyitforlife/ suggests these are some tough shoes that will last for a long time. Mine started to wear and break on the inside, the inside material clearly feels cheap and unreliable. I just used them to go to the office and back, no intense use. So I conclude that I got a pair of fakes - waste of money. I suggest you buy them from a reliable shop, this adidas shop on amazon sells fakes (or maybe you are luckier).",3,0,14
"They really don't make these like they used to. For those unaware, Sambas used to come in leather and kangaroo leather (Samba K). They later started making these, the Samba Classic, as an affordable option (same looks but nowhere near as durable). I'm not sure when the quality Sambas quit getting made, but the K was finally discontinued in 2012, leaving only this Classic/economy version. I really regret not keeping my Samba K's from 20 years ago and re-soling them, because I think those shoes could outlive me. The cheap ones that are the only ones available since 2012? Not so much. Adidas really should have kept the quality shoes an option, but planned obsolescence is the name of the game these days.

As for what I mean about quality, I wore holes clean through to my socks in both shoes exactly where the ball of my foot lands in less than 20 hours of play on AstroTurf. In fact, the entire sole wore down very quickly.

Still, they're good ol' Sambas: they fit great, are very comfortable and easy to break in, and points for not changing the style in forty years.",3,0,14
"I received these shoes April 30th and as of July 3rd the bottem of the shoe for my right foot is ripped and torn, not because of improper use either.

There were totally laced up and tied as if someone had been wearing them and slipped them off without untying. There was no stuffing in the shoes, which you would normally find with brand new shoes. And the outer part of the shoes definitely had some wear to them. They appear to be shoes that have been tried on and possibly worn around more than once.

"Ordered once - I have worn size 12 for 30 years. They were wayyyyyy too tight. I sent them back, got a 12 1/2 - still wayyyy too tight. Discovered it's not so much the length, although they are too short. It's more so the incredible lack of room for your toes. Unless your big toe is crazy flat, the top of the shoe with squeeze your toes into the soles. I managed to cram my feet into the shoes when I greatly loosened the laces but still couldn't take more than a few steps before they were too painful to keep on. Even if I got a size 13 or 14 I believe these shoes would still crush my toes. Horrible design.

This is it for me and buying shoes online from Amazon.",1,0,14
"*BUYER BEWARE* The photos showing the black shoe with white adidas strips are very misleading. The top photo (Blk/Wht) shows the leather material version and the rest of the photos show the cloth/canvas material. However, the other color option (blk/wht/wht) shows the canvas version for the picture and a picture of the leather one as another picture of the product. I inteded to get the leather material ones but instead received the cloth/canvas ones. However, I do like these shoes and they fit great I just think that the seller should show pictures of the actual product not a hodgepodge of intermixed versions of the same shoe. I hope this makes sense.",3,0,14
"Went up half a size and still fits like a surgical glove from toe to arch. But loose at the ankles, so they feel like extremely tight sandals.
I guess these would work well as compression shoes, because I feel like my blood flow is cut, my feet too hot, and the plantar fascitis working its way in.

How many men have feet this flat and narrow for the design to be so appealing? If your feet are wide (at all), or your arches are anything more than horizontal, then pick a different style.

They look good though.",2,0,14
"*Dec 2016: Six months after having the shoes they are already ripping apart. My husband only wears these once maybe 2 times a week if he is lucky. These are his ""nice"" shoes that he only wears when going out somewhere that needs a nicer shoe. He really loves the way they feel, but I did the math and he has only worn these between 35-40 times. Not worth it if they are going to rip that easy.
*Review shortly after getting the shoes in June 2019:
I bought these for my husband. Right away he told me they fit so we'll. He didn't have to break them in at all. They just fit like a glove right away. They also look really nice and seem really durable. Very happy with this purchase.",1,0,14

Not happy AT all but I don't have time to send them back bc I need the shoes now. Grrrrr.",1,0,14
"So this is actually my second pair of Adidas that are totally unwearable despite being the correct size. I wore their sneakers as a teenager and they were wonderful and comfortable, but I guess this just isn’t a good brand anymore. Initially I had the same issue many have mentioned here with the shoes fitting size wise but the toebox area feeling really tight even though they’re not too small lengthwise at all.

So I noticed that the “cushion” insole was in there really loose and I wondered if it would be better if I just took it out, so tried that. Ok, instantly much more normal shoe fit. The insert is far too thick and crushes your feet from the bottom, it’s not a width issue.

Unfortunately even after that made it a somewhat workable shoe, they just will not break in and are very uncomfortable. They are stiff as all hell and I mean I gave them a month of daily use because I like how they look. But yeah, I will not be purchasing this brand again, total waste of money.",1,0,14
"To preface I am used to sketchers, to be more specific the Skechers Men's Classic Fit-Delson-Camden Sneaker which you can grab for about the same price. I would way recommend these as ive worn them for about 2 years and while the sole has worn out and they are stinky if you have multiple pairs of shoes (and you buy the right size) these shoes will last and feel great. The are flexible light weight and extremely comfortable, if they didnt stink I would wear them every wear because they make the ground feel soft when its not. Good for tennis as well tight enough to bend to your command.

Now to the review these shoes, they are stiff as a board, and the back is as well. I walked around campus for about 20-30m (not all at once) taking 50m breaks because I was in class. After about 10m of this I at a scrape on the back of my left foot. Tbf I was wearing low socks but whats done was done and I could not take back that scrape. Due to this I am letting my foot heal and I cannot break in these shoes. The look nice and have good inner-soles but I wouldnt buy again id rather buy more sketchers.",3,0,14
"I ordered the Bart ones for my brother, but got the normal ones. Cant return cause I live outsode the US and returning it will cost me more than just ordering another pair. The quality is ok, but not as good as any of my adidas shoes, so there might be something off with these. I will try to update in a couple of months, however I'm very dissappointed.

I guess that if you live in the US, you could just buy them, see if you get the ones you wanted and return them if not. If you live outside, dont risk it unless you're ok wearing any of the other ones.",2,0,14
"Way too small for a size 12 foot unfortunately. It's weird I never had this issue with any other pair of Adidas I've worn, but this one was too tight and squeezed my feet to being completely unwearable. I would avoid this if you're a 12 like me, especially if you have wide feet.",1,0,14

Disappointed that this is falsely advertised. I did receive the same shoe and correct size however there’s no sign of a Simpson’s theme on the shoes at all which is what we wanted. My son needed these shoes and to have them picked up and sent back just to wait on another pair is a huge inconvenience so we will be keeping them only because I did pay a good price but again it’s disappointing and people should be aware before purchasing these under false advertisement.,2,0,14

These used to be great shoes all I ever bought for a long time. They just don`t seem like as good a quality anymore. Also i wish Adidas would make these in a wider width.

"Do NOT buy these sneakers. They are made of a lower grade fabric than previous Adidas sneakers I have purchased and within two-half months they have developed a good-sized hole near the toe area on one shoe only. Amazon said it was beyond their return window, provided a $5 courtesy credit, and told me to follow up with Adidas. Adidas told me to file a claim including the original receipt and photos of the defect. They would review it within 6-10 business days. Within one business day, they wrote back saying they don't cover normal wear and tear and my claim was therefore being denied. Full disclosure: my son has two other pairs of sneakers that he wears and interchanged with wearing these so they were not worn daily. I get that these are the lower end of Adidas' line of shoes but still one would not expect them to give out so soon. The rubber toe area needs to be extended to give it more protection if the fabric is going to fray that easily. Again, I highly caution against buying these sneakers.",1,0,14

"Ordered these based on how much I loved my Ultraboost 20, size W8.5. The 20 had a cool piece of stuff near the heel that broke up it up a bit and this new style does not. It has the giant, white platform looking heel. The ones I have are the most comfortable shoes ever so I thought I'd just get over the appearance. These showed up and were very bulky. More like a men's shoe than a women's, even in my converted size. My toe knuckle stuck up through the mesh too so they just seemed awkward all the way around. Received great, and they returned easily. No problem with shipper. Wish I'd have bought 3 pairs when I fell in love with last year's version.",3,0,14
"The quality/design of these shoes has changed. I'm a distance runner and I've been a religious Boost fan since about 2015. I've purchased at least a dozen pairs of different models over the years through here and other retailers and have loved them.

This past March I purchased 2 pairs of adidas mens Ultraboost 21 Running Shoes from Amazon.com and they are absolutely terrible. I rarely ever have blisters on my feet however, with the new design of these shoes I get blisters in every run over 5-6 miles so I cannot use them for longer runs.

Terrible. Absolutely terrible.

I've tried them over and over again but the issue repeats. $360 down the drain.

The previous versions of boost were fantastic...if you can find the older versions purchase those instead...you will likely be very disappointed with these...

"I have mixed feelings for these sneakers. On the one hand, they ARE comfortable and they ARE a decent pair of sneakers. However, they are a lot less comfortable than my ultraboost 4.0s or any ultraboosts of that time. They are bulky and heavy in comparison and are extremely snug (size between 0.5 to 1 size bigger!) While the shoes are decent, I find it quite difficult to justify the $180 price tag on a pair of sneakers that are, pretty much in every way, inferior to their predecessors. Although, it has ""more"" boost, it does not translate to any increased comfort. Overall, a decent shoe experience if they were named other than the successor in the Ultraboost line-up; but as an ""Ultraboost"" shoe, I am afraid they come up short.",3,0,14
 The shoes fit like a glove and were very snug. All my sports shoes are Adidas. Unfortunately on these shoes both of my big toes would snag on the part of the shoe where the sock fabric changes to a harder part of the toe area. You can see in the motion of my video how this occurs. I'm returning these shoes for this reason.,1,0,14
"Ordered both 10.5 and 11. Both were extremely tight around toes and side of feet. The back of the shoe has virtually no ankle support with inside padding jabbing right below your ankle. Loved my 2019 ultra boost and it’s a shame they finally wore out these are a very poor redesign. Also, the heel tread is super white and really obnoxious looking",1,0,14
"I really wanted to like these...but I didn't. The shoe felt too narrow and too shallow in the toes box. I did a 3-mile run/walk mix in them and had blisters on 3 toes. I usually wear a 12 in all my other shoes including multiple pair of Adidas. Also, when striking the ground I didn't notice much cushion. My Asics Gel Cumulus 21s are FAR superior to these in both comfort and cushion. Even my Adidas Pulseboost HDs were way better than these. I know individuals have different feet that fit better to different shoes but these were a let-down for me. (6'2"" 220)",2,0,14
"I don't think these shoes are worth the price. They tend to fit smaller than usual size, I believe they're 1/2 size smaller than they should be, so take that in mind.
Then there's the fit on the side of the shoes, it's just too tight on the sides and the border of the shoe rubs and inserts below the ankle, so for me it's way too annoying for running.
I had to insert a wedge everyday before using them, to widen the shoe up a bit more so they wouldn't rub against my ankles while running. Wanted to like them, but just hate these shoes.",2,0,14
"I discovered ultraboost 20s last year and needed a new pair of sneakers. I love my 20s, so I bought a pair of 21s despite not being crazy about their appearance.

Not only are they significantly heavier, they are subjectively less attractive, and they don’t fit the same for me. There is too much support by the ankle bone that rubbed me the wrong way and the toe box is much tighter size for size. I would’ve needed to go up half a size for a shoe that fit. Needless to say I returned them and am now looking toward the DNA line.",2,0,14

I have been running in them for a couple months now and it is the same. Seems to be what they are.

"I'm usually a huge fan of Adidas products. Most pairs I've had last me for a year or more. These (the most expensive Adidas I've bought), on the other hand, started breaking down within a week. For context, I'm a budtender. Most of the time I'm on my feet, but it's never intense activity. I bought these for the standing comfort - and my goodness are they amazing. However, only 5 or so days later, the sole started peeling! I have no idea what could have caused it aside from faulty adhesive or something. I really do love Adidas and the shoe is comfortable, but I'm really disappointed at how quickly they started coming apart.

"I decided to try Addidas running shoes for the first time after many years wearing Hoka One One. I have been running for over 10 yrs and run half marathon distances.

Two issues:
These shoes are very snug and feel like a compression sock. I have narrow feet so I would assume they would be uncomfortable for those with wide feet.

After my second run, the insole on my right foot started sliding backwards. After my third and final run, they were almost coming out of the shoe. I have since initiated a return on these shoes.

Addidas needs to improve their shoes if they want to compete with the bigger names in running shoes. After experiencing the issue with the insole, I found that many people complained about the same thing.",2,0,14

I was concerned about the thin bottom when I was researching them but bought them anyway. I run about 25 miles per week. Almost exclusively on pavement but sometimes off pavement. Never on trails. Not exactly sure how long they have been like this but just noticed today. I've had them for three months. This is not an inexpensive shoe.

The box was left in the pouring rain for once. I’m not sure why a box wasn’t used rather than plastic. The box also looked opened.

"Well made, nice looking sneaker that hurts both sides of my feet for the first 15 or 20 minutes after putting them on. Its aggravating.

After awhile it goes away, but still, it shouldn't be like that......",3,0,14
"I want to start off by first saying that I have been a big fan of the Ultraboost by Adidas. With that being said, I am extremely disappointed by the quality and built of Ultraboost 21. After wearing it for a few weeks in the gym, the side of the sneaker began to fall apart and the left shoe insole started slipping backward during my workout. The situation has gotten progressively worst over time and now the insole would start shifting even on light walk. This has never happened with my past sneakers and I am not sure if these two issues are tied specifically to the material or design. To remedy the insole slippage, I have decided to put in new Dr Scholl's Sports insoles.",2,0,14
This my 5th pair of Ultraboost running shoes starting with the 19. Loved them all until the 21. I believe there is a design flaw with the 21 model. The ankle is cut straight across with no contour or soft material and tends to cut into the bottom of the ankle when running. My wife is experiencing the same discomfort with hers so definitely not a single pair defect.,1,0,14
I expected more from Adidas. This shoe has lots of BOOST. Big deal. It looks like a clown shoe. The sock type upper feels cheap. Don’t believe the hype on this sneaker. The price of $168 dollars is horrible. Plenty of better sneakers out there for half the price. Unreal.,2,0,14

"Ocean plastics waste is an increasingly visible problem. Not only the problem, however, but also a few solutions to reduce the amount of plastics are popular for environmentally conscious customers. While it would be best to eliminate the plastic from ever entering the ocean, what's already there poses a thread to wildlife for a long time aside from simply looking bad.

Adidas is providing some publicity to the ocean cleanup by using the materials in portions of these running shoes. That certainly is also a way to wash that corporate conscience. It is not completely clear which material is from the ocean, but there is likely plenty new material, too. (My guess would be the neon yellow/green hard plastic frame.) Adidas: ""This product is made with Primeblue, a high-performance recycled material made in part with Parley Ocean Plastic. 50% of the upper is textile, 92% of the textile is Primeblue yarn. No virgin polyester."" So I guess it's part of the upper (only?), actually, that's sourced from ocean plastic. (The massive sole being fully new materials.?)

Anyway, the upper is a stretchy fabric that's more like a sock. The ties are to secure the shoe better, but there is no traditional tongue. What's traditional though is the use of laces. In fact, the sock part of the upper is fairly tight that the laces almost seem unnecessary. I got my size, and typically shoes half a size smaller still fit comfortable. These sneakers not so much, and although I understand that they should be intimate with your feet, they almost feel I should have gotten half a size bigger. The sole is unique in only the very tip being flexible and the rest fairly stiff. The heel is likely a result of the boost function to add a bit more spring to your step. (There isn't an actual spring, of course.)

The sole's heel is oddly shaped and although functional not exactly attractive. It's different though, and that's sometimes all that matters. There are a few different sections that are of a different color/material. Continental is embossed in the toe section, indicating also the use of that company's material. (Not of the recycling kind)

The white design is not the best to hold up to daily wear and tear, or mostly dirt, but it's a popular decision for running shoes. They don't glow in the dark, but with enough imagination, they might especially with that squeaky clean conscience. ;-)

Of course, the shoes sport the trademark three stripes, albeit that section is unexpectedly stiff. The placement does not make it a problem for comfort though. The upper material is soft and stretchy. Aside from being hard to put on, the material tends to be itchy when I decided to wear them bare foot.",3,0,14
"Adidas' Ultraboost 21 running shoes have a lot going for them. The cushioning, particularly in the heel, is excellent. The shoes absorb the impact on my heel and the Ultraboost midsole gives me plenty of arch support and comfort. The mesh sock upper is extremely breathable but it is also very awkward. It forms around my foot like a sock and the sizing is a bit off, resulting in a flat toebox that flops whenever I run or walk. The hard plastic lacing structure sticks in my foot a bit as well.

I've used a number of running shoes over the years including an excellent pair of Mizuno Wave Enigma 5's that I've had for a few years now and they are still going strong. I don't get the long-lasting vibe from these Ultraboost 21's. I have a feeling that the mesh upper will wear out quickly.

While I love Adidas, I don't love these particular shoes. If you're looking for longevity and a decent fit (or don't like the sock like feel of these shoes), look elsewhere.",3,0,14
"I'm an avid runner and always turn to the Adidas Ultraboost line for my daily trainer since 2018. I've definitely seen the show improve year after year, with the Ultraboost 20 being my favorite. I got the Ultraboost 21 when my previous pair wore out and something is off here. 20-mins into my treadmill run I noticed a sharp pain in my left foot coming from something hard and pointy from the side of the sole. When I took the shoe off I couldn't feel anything with my hand but I had a painful blister on my foot. I still have no idea what in the shoe caused the blister but when I put it on again I immediately felt it. Needless to say I returned it straight away. Going back to my Ultraboost 20 until I find a replacement.",1,0,14
"This shoes used to be the most comfortable a daily training/casual lifestyle.
Now is non of the about!
Too heavy and because al the stiff hard plastic on the sole of the shoes it is ridiculous Loud to run on them.
From the lifestyle point of view this shoes are very stiff so they put a lot tension and pressure on the plantafacia.
They also added 20% more Boost in the heel, at a ridiculous 30 mm high stack, but becouse is very compressed it a actually feels harder than the Ultraboost 20s.
Stay away from 21 and stick with the Ultraboost 20s.",1,0,14
"firstly these aren’t the clouds you’re used to walking in the OG Ultraboosts. the boost in the heel is polarizing due to it’s supersized nature and they make your feet like a whole size longer. they’re comfortable enough but not for $180. these were $129 on Amazon

there’s a hard hidden cuff i circled in the picture that digs into your ankles. i have to return em because of this! i don’t think my ankles are particularly large so just be weary",3,0,14
"A big disappointment. Not nearly as good as previous versions (20 and 19) of Ultraboosts. The reason for purchasing Ultraboost would be for the wonderful cushioning under the whole foot. But this version (21) has only a good cushioning under the heel and not the forefoot.
Before going on a run I always test my shoes at work by walking in them and these were the most uncomfortable running shoes yet. This could be just an individual thing as everyones for is different but I can't believe how different and much worse the 21 version is compared to 20 or even 19. Stay away from this version!",1,0,14
The top of the sneaker at the toes is too tight. I have skinny feet and can see my toes popping out the top of the shoe. Toes were killing me after wearing for half hour,1,0,14
The orange part in the pictures almost looks like orange sherbet colored but in person it is a very bold orange neon. The shoes are nice but we definitely prefer the Ultra Boost 20 (and even 19) much better than the 21 (sorry adidas),3,0,14
"Después de un poco más de 1 mes de comprados y unos días de uso con estos zapatos no me siento satisfecho trotando con ellos, pues son muy rígidos y no son cómodos pues el rebote en cada zancada es muy fuerte y produce mucho cansancio. Compré por la misma fecha otros zapatos de la marca Asics con mucho mejor performance por lo cual me gustaría devolver los Adidas Ultraboost y recibir a cambio otro par de esta marca Asics.",2,0,14
"I’ve ordered this from the seller ANZA on October 2021. But I received a fake shoe from them. You can see the pictures, as you can see the show I received had glue marks, imperfect stitches. As a person a who own a ultraboost 21, I can clearly tell this is a fake one. Also I checked the ART number inside the shoe, the number the shoe had is for a different color, which clearly shows this is a fake item.",1,0,14
Best ultraboost so far. The uppernit fits perfect and comfortable. You'll forget you're even wearing ir after some time. Lot of boost. Great lifestyle and running shoes. A but pricey but worth it. Love the look and feel of it.,1,0,14
"Item came used. The box looked like it was put through a wood chipper. The shoes were very dirty, scuffed, and had rocks in the bottom. The text on the insole was falling apart. Super unhappy with this order and returned right away.",1,0,14
"I have purchased athletic shoes for a multitude of uses over the years, Biking, golf, running, hiking, tennis etc. I have never purchased a product which is so tight/small for the size listed. Additionally, I didi not see that I could even return the item which was very disappointing. I purchase another pair in a larger size and am very satisfied. Please be sure to order a wider, or 1/2 size larger than you would ordinarily purchase.",1,0,14
"Uncomfortable and they are not waterproof. I thought they were.

I play golf using a golf cart early in the morning when there is some dew on the grass. No rain and no puddles and minimal contact with damp grass, yet my socks are wett after 18 holes.

Why would Adidas make a golf shoe that is not waterproof or, at least, water resistant?",1,0,14
"I had tried on size 13s in a store but they were too narrow, so I ordered a pair in ""13 wide"" from Amazon. When I tried them on, they felt exactly the same as the 13s. The box said ""13 wide,"" but the tag and the tongue did not. Since there are dozens of other reviews and questions referring to the same problem, it seems that this is a systemic issue and Amazon is shipping regular-width shoes in boxes that say ""wide."" I am returning these shoes and will not try again.",1,0,14
"I need a wide show, and the listing for this shoe said it was side. Looking at it however, it looked very narrow, and fit the same. My feet were hurting within minutes of wearing them. I tried twice walking around to see if they would break in, but they didn't. Also I've learned that many shoes in the label put a E if the shoe is side. There was not such indication in label size of this shoe. I think it would be a good shoe, if it fit me.",3,0,14
"Ordered 12W. As others have noted / asked, the product really is not WIDE. The box says 12 WIDE, but the tag indicates 12D, which is medium in US nomenclature. The shoe's length is fine - just as I expect for a 12 in US sizing. But the width is a bit narrow mid-foot, and is exceptionally TIGHT in the toebox. (Admittedly, I have a wide toe-box. Love the old Reebok CF Nanos with their wide box.) Also, it's rather tight over the top of my mid-foot. (Admittedly, I have a very high instep (?), such that I need a wide AND tall toebox.) I do believe the shoe will stretch a bit and will be much more comfortable over my foot. Much more concerned about pinching in the toebox. So I will continue wearing at home in an attempt to stretch it out.

On the plus side, the shoe is exceptionally light, and the sole has good gripping power, albeit this is dry / summer weather, so less critical. If the shoe stretches out, it will be comfortable with THIN socks (no way can I wear it at the moment with thick socks).",3,0,14
"The picture does not do it justice. Nor, do many of the reviews. Only found one that said the shoe runs narrow and has a narrow style.
So, I ordered them a size larger than I normally wear. It is a good thing.
They are long for my foot, but fit tight on the width.
If I returned them, I would not buy this shoe again, as the style does not fit my feet.
By design, they are long, skinny golf shoes.",1,0,14
I have always worn a size 10 1/2 wide shoe. According to Adidas size chart I decided to purchase the extra wide golf shoe in size 10 1/2 after comparing their measurments to my actual feet measurements. The shoes seem snug at first and after playing 1 round of golf I removed the shoe and found my sock a bloody mess. Their shoe are at least 1/2 size smaller than advertised and not near an extra wide as advertised. Ended up giving them to my grandson who normally wears a size 10 normal width. He said they fit perfect. I will never by shoes online again unless I'm sure the size advertized is accurate. Extremely disappointed in a brand name shoe. I'll stick with Footjoys.,2,0,14
Reviews are good for this shoe and apparently its the #1 selling golf shoe on Amazon however I've played 6 rounds in the spike less version and had my feet slip a couple of times costing me strokes. I would return them but threw the box out when I opened them. Ill just use them as walking shoes but I definitely wanted to warn others not to go this route unless you don't require traction. There is a reason Pros still use metal spikes after all and its not so they have less grip to the ground.,1,0,14
"The shoes look pretty good and feel comfortable while walking and wearing. My problem was that they were very difficult to put on. I had a hard time getting them opened up enough and the back was so flexible there was nothing to help me pull them on. I usually wear a 10 1/2 size and these shoes are size 11, so one would think they would go on easier than they did for me. It was difficult to spread the laces open far enough so that I could slide my foot inside. I had to physically pull the laces, one by one back down the lace channel a long way in order to manage the task. I think they might be a bit easier if I carried a shoe horn with me.",3,0,14
"I have wide feet and these fit great, but they do not keep your feet dry with wet grass from morning dew. These are also a lot of trouble to clean the wet grass from the bottoms. Due to these 2 issues, I'm going back to wearing running shoes; they don't keep my feet any drier, but are a lot easier to clean. Would not recommend these unless you play on dry courses. I removed the cleats and started wearing them again, but now the fabric has stained yellow. Looks awful and will not come clean. Save your money and buy something else.",1,0,14
Shoes tore at sole within 6 months of use. Amazon wont entertain any requests since the order is over 6 months old. Adidas says i have to go back to amazon. so i'm stuck. be careful.,1,0,14
"I was hoping to get more than one season (of summer golf) from these shoes. But that didn't happen. While comfortable, they were not the least water resistant given the porous material above the molded sole. The fact they were not water resistant wasn't a surprised or the reason I don't like these shoes. It was when the molded sole separated from the upper shoe portion that prompted my low rating of these shoes.

If you want a sturdy sneaker-style golf shoe, don't buy these. My suggestion is to purchase anything made by New Balance and you will not have wasted your money.",1,0,14
"honestly these are great but... one of those ""dangerous to buy online"" situations. keeping them as they work great but the heel design is the ""two pronged"" version that i should have noticed. be prepared to band-aid up at the start at least. then tend to run a tad thin to boot imho (i have never ordered or worn a ""wide"" for any shoe but these feel like i should have. both issues are solved to some degree by lacing up very loosely and with high backed socks. honestly it's a good show but know the above before you buy :)",3,0,14
"I saw other reviews that sizing was identical to sneakers. For me, as soon as I saw these I knew they looked small. I wear a 10.5 - 11 so I bought 11. I could not even get my foot into them fully unlaced! I thought maybe they were womens, but it says ON THE SHOE, they were 11 Men US. I figure I will need a 12 to get into them but that size jumps in price. Returning to buy a different shoe.",3,0,14
I like the look of these shoes and had originally ordered the Medium width which was too tight. Normally I wear a 9.5 Medium. I returned those and ordered these Wide width and could barely tell the difference. I have never tried on a Wide shoe that felt tight as usually they feel to loose. These probably won't fit most feet comfortably. Too bad because I like the shoe and it looks nice.,2,0,14
"I've worn these for about 5 rounds now and the more walking I have to do the more my feet hurt. They're simply just not comfortable to me. I'll be spending a bit more next time and getting a better quality shoe.
Last round was cart path only and holy cow... My feet were toasted afterwards... I'd just assume wear my everyday tennis shoes than these at this point....",3,0,14
"I ordered this golf shoe in 11 wide. They are still way too narrow for my feet. I played 9 holes in them one day and then 18 the next hoping they would get more comfortable. They hurt the side of both feet where my little toe starts. Just not wide. I suggest anyone definitely needing a wide golf shoe do not get these.
I find a sneaker shape shoe in wide is better for my feet. I thought I would try these for the price and and the reviews. I even got a 1/2 longer than usual and wide but just not wide enough. I probably will just end up giving to someone.. Do not order these if you require WIDE shoes.",1,0,14
"I have a pair of Adicross Classics in 9.5m that I have been wearing for a few years. I found the sole and insole to be completely flat and it was causing issues after walking a full 18. I ordered the Tech Responses in a 9m figuring they would be a little more snug and have a better arch. Not only is the insole super flat but the toe box is much narrower at the outside edge so it pinched my pinky toe in. I didn't wear them for a round as I knew after a test fit they wouldn't work, but if you have a normal to wide foot these may not be for you.",3,0,14
"I wear an 11.5 in all my athletic shoes and I buy them often. So I got these in an 11.5 wore them for a 9 hole half round and my right toes were killing me. Probably too late to ask for a return since I wore them and they are sort of useless now. I'd call it a defect as the left shoe feels fine, but how do I prove that. Amazon if you screen these, what should I do? They really are garbage and that is where I'm going to put them if there is no return value. They clearly are not sized to a true 11.5 and the build of these shoes is very cheap.",1,0,14
"Have several adidas and these fit, length wise, perfect. I thought they would be more like sneakers and not require a break in period. Wore them to walk 9 holes and got blisters on the ankles. The ankle support area is very rigid. They will probably break in eventually but be warned. Wear high socks when breaking these in and stick to carts only until you know they won't hurt your feet.",3,0,14
"I have 11B foot size when measured in a shoe store. I have 11N foot joys that fit perfectly. I read reviews by others that say this shoe runs on the narrow side. I have a narrow foot. I figured an 11 would be fine. My big toe has about a 1/2"" room which is perfect but the front is a bit pointed so my little toes are getting cramped. The front of the shoe should have been more rounded versus pointed.
The shoe is light and comfortable for 9 holes. After that my little toes start to scream.",3,0,14
"I have owned several pairs of these shoes and in the past have recommended them highly for value and comfort. However, something has changed in the quality of the product. The photos above show the shoes after only 6 months of use, mind you, only being used a day to two a week. They are literally falling apart and are an embarrassment to wear any longer. Adidas thinks this is just fine and what I should expect apparently, as they refuse to acknowledge that there is a problem and just cite their ""policy"" for standing behind their products. I cannot in good conscience recommend anything except staying away from this product.",1,0,14
A comfortable shoe overall. I am hoping that wearing them in may stretch them a bit. I ordered wide and they are very tight. I'm hopeful that in time they will be as comfortable as they look. At the price you will be hard pressed find anything better. Just order 1/2 a size larger and a full size wider than you usually have,3,0,14
"Looks great. They' aren't water proof, but I wasn't expecting that anyway. I've had a lot of great Adidas golf shoes (like the AdiBoost). Almost didn't keep these. But added a pair of Dr. Scholl's padded insoles and they'll be fine for walking 9 holes.",3,0,14
"I've had these golf shoes for a little less than one year. The good points are they fit well and are pretty comfortable. The bad points are they are not water resistant at all and they are falling apart. I know they were not claimed to be waterproof but I thought they would be somewhat resistant at least to morning dew...not at all! Also, as you can see from the photo, they are starting to fall apart. Not clear from the photo, but the sole is also starting to separate from the top. I also bought a gray pair a month after these and they are also deteriorating. Sorry I cannot recommend these shoes.",2,0,14
"I originally orded this golf shoe in the spikeless style. When I received it (it was spikeless), it was too small so I sent it back while the Co. offered to send the corrected length. The 2nd shoe that I received was the correct size BUT not the same shoe, as this one came with spikes. I decided just to keep the shoes, too much hassel playing golf-shoe tag.",3,0,14
"Ordered wide width and should have noted all the concerns about whether the wide width shoes are ""wide"". They are not. The very narrow/pointed toe is a problem.

Will wear them some more, and continue looking for the golf shoe for walking that I am looking for. This isn't it.

Three stars for the price",3,0,14
"Immediately tried on shoes when I got them, only to be disappointed! Ordered a wide width and they were still to tight, seem to run narrow. I couldn’t even tighten them, plus the shoe tongue didn’t cover up my sock, lol. It was like the shoe tongue was too small so I returned them immediately! Glad I did try on before you buy because the next day they were at UPS! Disappointed because I have Addidas golf shoes right now and they fit great! They are the same price range too.",1,0,14
"The shoes were purchased as 12.5 W. The box they came in was marked as 12.5 W, but the shoes were not wide and were individually marked as 12.5 D. Unfortunately, I tried them on just past the 30 day return window. With the cold weather in Northern Ohio, didn't think to try them on earlier.",1,0,14
"My ordinary shoe size is U.S. 8 E (wide). Knowing that Adidas tend to be narrow, I ordered ""wide"" size 81/2 just to be sure that they would not be too small. After playing 18 holes, my feet were ruined and I could barely walk. The shoes squashed my toes and were terribly uncomfortable. I have to return them. These are not the shoes for a person with wide feet. I have no issues with the overall design or quality, which seem good.",2,0,14
"The shoe is narrow and is not comfortable in the heel, lacks cushion and arch support. I wore it for nine holes and doubt will wear again. Perhaps for practice, but doubt it. Definitely, a low end performance shoe, there are better shoes out there, especially for Adidas. Not sure why Adidas chose to manufacture this product other then for the price point.",2,0,14
I ordered 9 wide and the first box I received was marked as 9 wide but the shoes were just size 9. Amazon replaced them with a second pair but again the box was marked as 9 wide but the shoes themselves were just size 9. I returned them all and bought another brand from Amazon. Not Amazon's fault.,1,0,14
"You get what you pay for- at $50, these shoes were affordable, but they are also very flimsy and lightweight. They provide very little support or stability. It feels like there is nothing to them. That's good in that they are very lightweight, but bad in that they don't support your feet at all. I can feel the spikes right through the soles. Would not purchase these again.",2,0,14
These shoes were great for the first couple of months then they started to come apart on the toe. I played a lot of golf this season (over 40 rounds) and these shoes really got dirty and stained. Yes I know they are white but still I have to scrub them after almost every round of golf.,2,0,14
"The shoes look good enough but are very uncomfortable after about seven holes walking the course. The fit is good but there isn’t enough cushion in the sole and heel. I’ve worn Adidas tennis shoes since high school, fifty years ago, so I was pretty disappointed with these golf shoes.",3,0,14
"These feel fine at first, but after 4 full walking rounds my feet have REALLY hurt after each 18. I thought they'd break in and they are just painful. Additionally, they are NOT water proof at all. They don't claim to be, but they are definitely a summer shoe. Only good thing about these was the price...",3,0,14
"I was surprised by these for being adidas shoes, typically they're high quality. The seam on the outside right toe of the right shoe started failing within the first 2 months of wear. Albeit I was playing 2 rounds of golf per week, but <10 rounds of golf with the shoes before they failed?!?!? I would expect that from a bargain brand, but not from adidas. Overall they were fairly comfortable shoes but not what I expected in terms of quality.",2,0,14
"I did select a wide size 9 which is what I wear normally. I did receive a wide size 9, it indicated it was a wide shoe on the box and it was a mens version. The shoe was too narrow. My feet ( toe area) were killing me after just walking 9 holes.",2,0,14
I have already returned them. I bought them under the impression that they were a mesh shoe. I play in AZ and it’s very hot. I was looking for a full mesh upper to help with airflow. They are designed to appear as mesh but it’s just for show,3,0,14
"The moment I put these on I though, ""Not super comfortable, but they'll break in."" After 2 rounds (cart path only), I can't take it. SUPER uncomfortable! Not worth your time or money. Do not buy these. I will be contacting Adidas to voice my complaint.",1,0,14
Do not buy this shoe! Never have I had a golf shoes give me such blisters on the heel by hole # 2! All my golf shoes that I have had have the back support more or less vertical perhaps at 85-90 degrees. These shoes slant far more forward and cannot help but rub and cause serious blisters ! I have gone through many dozens of golf shoes and never have had such blisters !,1,0,14
"I own other styles of Adidas golf shoes so I was expecting a good fit. Unfortunately these were extremely narrow for me in the toe box, which is the exact opposite of what I was hoping. My toes felt like they were jammed together. Longth was fine, toe width not so much. Too bad, I think they are great shoes otherwise.",3,0,14
"All my golf shoes are 10-1/2 Wide, and fit very well. These shoes didn’t even come close to fitting, yet the were marked as 10-1/2 Wide. I noticed they were made in Vietnam, so perhaps they have different sizes there. I returned them.",1,0,14
I love the shoes except they developed a tear near the seam from normal use. Would have hoped to get more than a year out of the shoes. Very comfortable but disappointed. Not sure if this is the norm or perhaps a defect in the particular pair I received.,2,0,14
"The Adidas Men's Tech Response 4.0 Golf Shoe is a good value. Very comfortable and true to size. Shoes actually broke at the arch after just 8 months. My son bought the same shoe, and it broke down as well after just six months.",3,0,14
"These are fairly narrow, and I have a narrow foot. They do tend to stretch and are quite lite, so they still initially feel comfortable anyway, and they look great. I'm not a fan of pointy shoes like these, but I think after playing a couple rounds they will be very comfortable, and I was looking for a lite shoe. Seems to me that if you have even a little bit wide foot, you will need the W.",3,0,14

I ordered a 10 1/2 wide and they were too short. I returned and replaced with an 11. It actually hurt to put my foot in the shoe. If you really want these, order up a size and go wide. I will not be trying a 3rd pair.",1,0,14
"It feels tight around the toes. The box is labeled wide but the label under the tongue is normal size in several other countries. If you like this shoe in wide, you may want to bump up a 1/2 size.",1,0,14

"Fits well, lightweight, comfortable at first---- but after a couple of months wearing them, my feet hurt by the time I'm done 9 holes. Lace these up and my foot still feels like it's moving around. The inside pad feels lumpy to my feet. Can't feel it with my fingers bu8t put some weight on it and it hurts. Now I'm a big guy (240lbs) but they just feel worn out.",2,0,14
Played one season in them. Like the fit. Like the grip. They are falling apart in the outside of the toes where the shoes seam is. Not good if you play a lot and swing hard. The motion rips them apart. One season and they are going in the garbage.,3,0,14

Any other 8.5w I've purchased for without issue. Other than that the shoe itself is nice, light weight, with good plastic replaceable golf spikes. Sadly I will have to return this pair.",3,0,14
Ordered a wide but it’s bottom sole is still made for narrow. Doesn’t support wide feet on sole. No cushion and support in outer areas of feet to speak of so my son complains of achy feet after an hour.,2,0,14
Shoes seemed to fit right but after playing regularly for a few weeks I got severest pain on my left 4th toes. Upon checking I noticed a very sturdy inner surface was rubbing against my toes on the follow through. No give whatsoever. Had to stop golfing for a few weeks for a while until my toe healed. I cannot wear these shoes again. Need a softer shoe.,2,0,14
"Great price for these shoes, purchased for a trip. Overall, fit is good, however the lack of waterproofing ruins the experience.

Hoping they would have worked out, but will be looking for better alternative.",1,0,14
Shoes felt good but within 2 months of wearing the sole is separating from the shoe and I can no longer wear them. You feel the rubber flop around and occasionally it causes me to trip.,2,0,14
"I ordered these shoes in Feb 2019 and started using them an average of once a week. I ordered 10 W but received an 11 reg. I used them anyway, the fit was not perfect just O.K. I do not walk when playing golf so the shoes haven't received tough use. I just noticed on Monday (6-22-20) when I was cleaning them after playing golf that the sole was separating on my left shoe, bummer! I wear them an average of less than once a week and they are a little over one year old. I should think that they should last longer than that. So, buyer beware.",3,0,14
"These fit terrible. The length is fine but the area around the laces is way too low, I guess they’re are designed for the flat footed. There is absolutely no cushion inside, it’s like standing on concrete. The tie area is also a strange shape.",1,0,14
"Ordered a size 10, same as current shoes. Way too small and narrow. Could not wear same cushion socks I normally do. Good looking shoe, looks as though it would be light and airy.",2,0,14
My only negative is these can not be worn in grass that has morning dew or grass that was recently watered or your feet will be soaked. Other then that they are very comfortable and have amazing traction I will keep as my dry weather golf shoes and buy a waterproof pare as well.,3,0,14
"Wore these for 2 hours around the home before going out to golf and I’m so glad I did. Both feet had a gouge pattern and red marks all over the top of my feet.

Do not buy unless you have small feet.",2,0,14
"Had to return. Shoe looked great, light weight, but ordered a 9 1/2 wide and it wasn’t near that. If I had read more reviews I would have realized others thought the same. If you wear a medium width it’s probably a great golf shoe .",2,0,14
"I wore these golf shoes about 6 times (that's approximately 30 hours of wear) expecting them to loosen up a little. They were snug when I first put them on and expected they would conform to my feet enough to make them comfortable. They did not. I would suggest anyone ordering them to go at least one half size bigger. I re-ordered another pair one half size bigger because they were a handsome shoe, the price was right and had they fit properly they would be quite comfortable. We'll see.",3,0,14
"Nice shoe, little on heavy side, but solid construction. Soles are dangerous in my opinion, like walking on ice when concrete wet or slight incline on driveway. Why did they put cylindrical plastic inserts between sole patterns? Like the quality and construction, too dangerous to wear on concrete or when wet out!",2,0,14
"While the shoes seem very well made and were generally comfortable, they were far smaller than my other shoes of the same size. I had to send them back because they were too tight.",3,0,14
Overall its a good golf shoe but it's only good at $69 anymore and I wouldn't rate it this high.,3,0,14
Bought this shoe about one year ago for golf. Only play about once per week so I have worn these shoes maybe 40 times. The rubber cleats on the bottom are still not worn out. Today while playing golf the freakin bottom of the shoe fell off! These shoes are a joke. I guess you get what you pay for. I take care of my gear. These shoes have not been abused.,1,0,14
I am not sure if it is water resistant since I returned it. It’s a good looking and seems to be well made but not fitting as a golf shoes.,3,0,14
Ordered and received shoes labelled 9 1/2 US Men's but could barely get my feet into them. They were AT LEAST one full size too small. Both box and shoes labels said 9 1/2 Medium. They looked great but I had to return them.,3,0,14
very difficul to get shoes on,1,0,14
This is a lightweight and comfortable shoe. It is not waterproof so you will need to do that with Scotchguard or something like that. The inside of the heel wore out and and fell apart in about 6-8 months.,3,0,14
"Box said wide, shoe did not. These are quite narrow. There is no top down view offered...the toe on the size 11 ordered was very pointed, like a women’s shoe or fancy dress shoes...looked quite odd for an athletic shoe! The toe of my foot joy saddle shoes were way more rounded than these!",3,0,14
"Bought these for my Hubby. Happy to find him a wide shoe. The box says wide, but if you look at the tag on the shoe it clearly says ""D"". So... tried another pair to find the same problem: box says wide - shoe says ""D""! Returning them both. Don't buy if you really need a wide shoe!!!!!",1,0,14
I ordered the size that every shoe I wear is and these are way too tight. I can barely get them on with socks. I don’t like them.,3,0,14
"Yes these wear small. I found them to narrow to wear, length was consistent with my running shoes however. otherwise they would have been great.",3,0,14
Nice shoes but way too narrow if you have a wide foot. I ordered in wide width but no way are these a typical wide shoe.,1,0,14
"I was excited to purchase these for my husband at a great price as it can be hard to find decent looking wide shoes at such a low cost. We received the shoes, the order said wide, the box said wide but the shoes were normal width as that’s what their label stated and my husband’s foot proved. Not sure how it happened but feeling duped. Ended up having to purchase some Nike golf shoes that were actually wide fit and a bit more costly.",3,0,14
Product it's not water resistant for when I play golf if I encounter any water on Golf Course,3,0,14
these shoes were purchased assuming the 9 1/2 wide size would work. They are not as wide as I would have hoped and I have some toe pinching. Hopefully they will stretch a bit so I can wear them for 18 holes instead on 9 holes which is the limit without too much toe pain due to the narrow width.,3,0,14
"Shoe looks good.
Soles are comfortable.
I don't have wide feet but went with the wide size based on other reviewers (Thank you).
Wore it for the first time today and backs of both ankles are blistered.
Breaking in is going to be a painful process.",3,0,14
Shoes aren’t bad for the price but are very stiff and the high back digs into the back of my ankle. Not terrible for a round but def could be more comfortable. Grips well,3,0,14
Dont get the white. It literally is ruined the first outing. The mesh cannot be cleaned properly and gets really dirty looking. Black is a great shoe.,1,0,14
Most painful shoe I've ever worn. I have a blister on each foot form a short round on a 9 hole course. When you first try them on they feel great. It was about 45 mins into my round that it started. I could barely walk. They rub the back of my foot with every step. The worst thing is I bought them right before they closed all the courses so now that I have had a chance to use them its too late to return them. Bummer.,1,0,14
Shoe is light and breaths but mesh looks very dirty after a few trips to the sand trap. Cant really get them clean. My buddy has the same shoe and it looks bad too. Im embarrased to wear them after 1 season so tossing them in the trash.,2,0,14

"I ordered the 12W and they are snug and do not seem to be a true 'Wide'
Still wearable and somewhat comfy wearing them around the house to break them in some.

I think the Adidas BOA are a better shoe / better price and run true to sizing",3,0,14
the shoe fits well and is nice for dry weather. The back of it extends up fairly high and will take a couple wearing to break in. If you don't wear tall enough socks it will rub a blister on the back of your heel.,3,0,14

Great shoes but the way they are manufactured creates a cleaning problem. The mesh material on top of the shoe is overlayed on a material that stains and cannot be cleaned. There is a brown stain on both shoes that cannot be removed. I would not recommend buying these shoes and if there were a way to return them or get a refund that would be great since they are not wearable. Rricci@charter.net.,1,0,14
In my option the shoe photographs fine but it has a Very narrow toe box when I wore them. I had to spend the extra money and get the True Brand golf shoe.,2,0,14
Bought 1/2 size larger and fit ok but noticed shoes have a much narrower than my foot joys. Feet do get wet even in heavy dew. All in all shoes are ok for the money but don't think they will last as long as foot joys.,3,0,14
I ordered size 12 which normally fits loosely but was uncomfortably tight in the toes with this shoe.,3,0,14
"I purchased these Addidas golf shoes to replace a pair that had given me several years of good service and fit perfectly. Unfortunately, although I purchased the same size and model these are too small.

"Bought these because the price was right and looked like the running shoes I normally wear when golfing. Normally wear an 11 and since most reviews said the size was ok, I ordered an 11. The fit is a little tight in the forefoot and a little stiff, but hopefully they'll stretch out as I wear them more. Not as comfortable as my running shoes but since I got these on sale $60, the price was right.",3,0,14

I have purchased multiple pairs of Adidas shoes most of them through Amazon and other sites and typically the shoes fit according to size and of good quality. This particular pair was way too tight and too small. Although the shoe appears to look very nice upon close review of the faux leather it doesn't seem like it will last very long. It's not a comfortable shoe. Especially for a golfer. My recommendation is don't buy this shoe.,1,0,14
"My shoe size usually runs 10 - 10.5 depending on the shoe, I went with 10.5 for these. I use these shoes for running 2 miles a day and for work as housekeeping at airbnb's. Upon first putting them on they felt too snug, too narrow, and even the length seemed to be a little short in the big toe area. I figured maybe they just needed to be worn in a bit. It's been a couple months of very regular use and I just can't take the discomfort anymore. They make my feet cramp, my toes hurt and they leave painful red skin on the top of my foot where the laces are, are too tight. Also I noticed the heel part of the shoe is deformed. I tried slipping them on once and I crunched it down and I haven't been able to get it back to its regular shape yet, so it's just soft material in that spot with no real support. It's my fault for not finding a pair to try on before ordering them, but I can say I won't be purchasing any more shoes of this brand.",2,0,14
"Shoes lost their form after only a month of use. Low quality outside material developed tears and holes. Shoes became uncomfortable after usage cannot run too long with them on, my feet hurt. Overall very low value for an Adidas shoe, do not buy, not recommended.",1,0,14
Adidas seems to be lowering their minimum standards for shoe quality. The front top trim and around the shoe laces are made out of cheap felt that will easily show dirt because it is white for my shoe. The shoe fits well. That's why I usually buy Adidas. The shoe would be a 5 star shoe if it cost $40.,3,0,14
Horrible show. The stripes and the front stripping began to peel off within a week of wearing them. Poor construction. Normally I’m a fan of Addidas but this show was made poorly.,1,0,14
I bought these thinking that they had the same adidas tech as my last pair of duramo 7’s. I was in for a big disappointment as these new duramo sl’s had a stiff and non responsive midsole compared to the comfy and bouncy adiprene midsole of the old duramo 7’s I used to know and love.,1,0,14

"Just received the shoes and tried them on in the house just to get a feel for it. Will update later down the road but these are my first impressions:

1) I used to own the AX2 in size 9 and they fit perfectly. I purchased these in size 9 and they also fit, which is a plus that there’s hardly any deviation in size.
2) Like other folks are saying, the heel feels kinda loose no matter how tight you tie your shoes. This is concerning, so I’ll have to see how well it holds by the next update.
3) There’s hardly much for cushioning or arch support. If I recall correctly, my AX2 shoes were comfy to wear regarding arch and cushioning. These however you will have to buy different insoles to match your arch unless you have flat feet, but even then you may need to buy new insoles to deal with the fact the factory insole doesn’t have much in means of cushioning.
4) For those coming from Salomon shoes (I wear men’s size 8.5 for Salomons) I would recommend getting a half size larger, hence why I bought size 9 for adidas.

Compared to the Salomon Speedcross 4 which is the pair of shoes I’m replacing, I like the fact they fit my wide feet without a break-in period and the treads actually feel like they have good traction. However I don’t like the lack of arch support or cushioning which the Salomon speedcross has.
Hopefully I’ll remember to update",3,0,14
"I was so excited to get these. I love Adidas as a company and their sneakers fit great. This style, however, fits poorly at best. It's not just snug, it's uncomfortable. Some folks buy hiking shoes up a size and I feel like Adidas should take fit into account when they calibrate for size. I'm also peeved at the seller because I paid almost $10 for delivery and will have to pay more then $5 to return them. Also -- I'm pretty sure they're not new since they came with a receipt from Dick's Sporting Goods in the box -- OOPS -- as well as a fishing license holder and the receipt for that as well.
Scandalous, I know. An Amazon seller running a game.",1,0,14
"These shoes look nice. Unfortunately the heel cap feels pretty wide and loose with my foot, I find myself getting hot spots after about 3mi or a couple of hours on my feet in them. The do breathe well and quality of construction seems pretty good but time will tell. Overall just okay.",3,0,14
"A modern looking shoe with what seems like a funny fit, and seems to need considerable breaking in.

I picked a 10.5 (my athletic shoe size), and found the the fit...odd. The toe is pointed rather than rounded, so there's extra space at the tip, but my big toe hits the front. Odd design, since feet don't have a point in the center... Even cinched tightly, my heel slips a little (but doesn't come out). I'd need to use a spacer or wear heavy socks. The fit is okay at best.

The sole is pretty rigid for a lightweight shoe, like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a trail runner or a hiking shoe.

I may be spoiled by other brands that are ""ready to wear"", or may not be used to Adidas' design choices. But I don't want to spend the time breaking this shoe in hoping the fit is better once it's well-worn. It's going back.",3,0,14
"I bought theses based off of reviews, boy was I wrong. I couldn’t even walk around the house without my feet hurting. These shoes run extremely narrow in the front and are lose in the back. Every step I took my front side of the foot rubbed, as for my heels, they would lift off from the shoes. Maybe I got a faulty pair but I haven’t had a lot of luck with shoes on Amazon.

I’m not even sure how to rate how the fit is for these shoes. If I had to rate them, it would be goofy.",1,0,14
"Runs a little small, so ordering a half a size up may be advisable for some people. Shoes have great traction, but aren't the most comfortable.
Also, it's hardly even water resistant, my socks get wet regularly when handling hoses on the job. So if that's important for you then this isn't the one for you.",3,0,14
"I usually wear a mens 12-13. I ordered these in a 13. Turns out they are so narrow that I dont think they would have been wide enough, had I ordered them in a 15.

Completely unwearable...and i apparently missed the return window by 1 day.",1,0,14
"Negative: These shoes, as others have described, are not very comfortable. Stiff sole. Tight toe box. I would say I possibly needed to size up, but the heel slipped a little as well.
Positives: They do have good grip and seemed to be holding up well over aprox 50 miles of off road use.
I bought these because they were inexpensive but every time i wore them i got blisters.
I gave them away and bought something else.",3,0,14
"I thought i had scored a great deal on these sturdy trail runners. For the most part they met expectations. They provide firm support, the tread is dependable and they are comfortable for long hikes in the terrain I frequent. But quality control was poor. The cloth lining around the opening of the shoe was shoddy material and is already worn through from normal use. I am extremely disappointed and discouraged with ADIDAS brand right now. I have worn nothing but their footwear for the past 5 years. This is my first encounter with shoddy material and workmanship.",3,0,14
"I love my Adidas AX2 but they’re wearing out. Figured I’d get these AX3s as a replacement. My US11.5 AX2s fit like they were custom made - and lasted forever! But the AX3s in US11.5 are easily 1/2 size small - look at them side-by-side and the difference is quite obvious. My AX2s were made in China and the AX3s are made in Vietnam; I have no idea if this has anything to do with the sizing mismatch.

I’m not sure what’s up with Adidas these days. Part of what I like about the brand beside durability is the true-to-size attribute throughout their line. A US11.5 Adidas shoe has ALWAYS been my size, back to when I played tennis in my trusty Adidas Barricades. Lately, you’ll see many comments about how they now run small.",1,0,14
"I am not sure what shape feet these shoes are supposed to fit, but it isn't mine. My feel feels like it is sitting more on top of the shoe than in the shoe if that makes sense. Like how it would feel if you put TWO insoles in your shoes.
The construction and material seem good, I like the way they look, I just wish they were not a strange shape causing excess heel lift. Will be returning.",2,0,14
"These shoes are very stiff, do not conform well to my feet, and wearing them occasionally for less than 2 months has worn out the material of the inner heel and tears up the heels of all my socks. They haven’t broken in, they’ve just broken down. Wouldn’t recommend.",1,0,14
"Bought these Adidas hiking shoes in July after having several pairs of Merrills over the years that lasted very well. These seemed good, but came home after walk today 7 months later with a blister on my right heel.

"Felt great at home. Then I got them on the trail. Wore them on day two. ""Didn't have time to pull them out of the bottom of my hiking pack for day 1"" Took them off after a couple hours on day 2. Never put them back on.

MAYBE it's my toes, but I put my steel toe boots back on for the remainder of the trip and my feet feel fine. If I had kept these on I am 100% sure my toes would be in tatters.

I had really high hopes for these because they felt great the day I tried them out for work.",2,0,14
"I tried these one and while they seem good overall, the toe box is way too small. I tried my regular size and a half size up. For me the toe box was a deal breaker. Even the slightest movement of the toes was restricting.

I don't have large toes or anything. This design just wasn't for me. I ended up getting the Adidas Terrex Tracerocker instead.",3,0,14
"This product is advertised as a hiking shoe, would expect that to mean high quality durable materials. In less than two months the linning has began to fall apart.

"Whoever said these are waterproof or even water resistant definitely never tried it to be true. Just a casual walk thru a park on wet grass from rain showers the night before my socks where very wet maybe 10 mins in. No puddles no small running water just very wet grass will ruin your day with these shoes. They fit great, feel grippy which is great but I was expecting some water resistance at the very least.",3,0,14
"Worn these shoes for about 5 months as work shoes through the summer. I both love and hate them. I love them because they have great support, were extremely comfortable, and I just like the look of them too.
Now the downsides... in only 5 month, as a work shoe, not hiking, the soles are almost entirely worn smooth, I dont even have to walk a whole lot, im an autoglass technician, so its just climbing all over cars and semi trucks.
The heel supports are now wearing through the inside of the heel, starting to dig into my achilles.
The price when I bought these was also $79usd and had prime delivery. And now that I need another pair, they have gone up 20 bucks plus 10 dollar shipping.

They are great shoes, for a short period of time. I've had worse made shoes for sure. But these still aren't made too well. Very good for one season though.",3,0,14
"This is the 9th different pair of shoes I have ordered and they have all been the same. Too narrow, no padding, uncomfortable. Very disappointed.

"For the most part it was a good shoe with good traction, good fit, but I went on my first hike and it was a normal trail without any obstacle about 4 miles loop, and the left shoe ripped near the ankle area. Like seriously I paid 80 dollars for these, I expect it to last a little longer than one hike and little more than 4 miles before it freaking rips! At first I was like whatever’s and take it on my second hike a few days later, about 5miles loop straightforward trail, and the other side ripped as well. Like wtf?! So disappointed at what they send out.... where is your quality support ! If this shoe can’t handle normal straightforward short hikes, how can you call this a hiking shoes? Come on adidas you are better than this! Waste my money..... hiked 9miles before it ripped...don’t buy just go for an actual reputable hiking outdoor brands",1,0,14

Roomie but painful. Had to return.",1,0,14

"The shoes arrived and looked really nice upon inspection. I should have listened to other reviewers when they stated the heel was loose. After trying them on, my feet fit in them like a normal shoe, but the heel was surprisingly wide. When you walked, it felt as if your foot was going to come out of the shoe. The house shows I bought from Walmart literally for better than these lol

While they did look nice, and felt comfy while standing, they were just too loose on the heel. Not sure an average size persons foot could fill them out.

Amazon refunded them promptly and I decided to order some ASICS trail shoes and they fit perfectly.",2,0,14

Bought this as my second pair of AX 3 hiking shoes. I bout the blue pair from a different seller and they fit perfect. Ordered these in the same size and the toe is extremely tight. My feet are always warm so I like room for them to breath. The blue pair is great this pair not so much.

"This was the second pair I tried to buy. First pair featured a half size too small fit. This pair was the correct sizing. Both pairs however, go figure, the left foot board, sole, whatever you call it, sloped to the left ! The sole of the left shoe allowed the ankle to bend. Never seen or felt anything like it. Some sort of manufacturing defect. Other wise the shoe was of fine quality, liked the styling, color and the cleat like soles as I planned on golfing in them.",2,0,14
"What others have said about the heel is true, your foot just doesn’t seem snug back there. Just did a 7.2 mile hike with them and It’s not a bad shoe but it wasn’t an all that comfortable ride. Sturdy sole but there’s a lack of cushioning where it counts. Spend more money and get something that’ll keep your feet happier",3,0,14
A little disappointed as they are not waterproof as advertised. The moment I stepped into a puddle that went over the bottom of the shoe water seeped into the mesh. They are comfortable and the look i wanted but you would be better off getting full leather boots for true waterproof protection.,3,0,14
Any water that comes down from above (e.g. rain) will go right through the top mesh. The reviews on this site are totally misleading and incorrect. The shoes fit great. They grip great. They look good. They are not waterproof though. I don't often write reviews.,3,0,14
"It was stated that these shoes are water resistant, but they are far from it. I got juice on them a day after they arrived, and went to spray them off quickly, and the half second they got water on toes, it soaked in inside of shoe. Definitely wouldn’t take them hiking if any chance of getting wet.",2,0,14
I’m usually an 11.5-12 but with a 12 these are too small. Order 1/2 size up if you want them. For a 12.5 the price jumps from 59.00-120$ so no dice returned them.,1,0,14
"Adidas were always the shoe that fit best, but this has a strange problem--the shoe presses my big toes in.

My son tried them and found they tilted his foot oddly.",2,0,14
My usual size was completely unwearable because of how narrow the toe box is. Crushed my big toe sideways. The shape of the sole is like a pointy dress shoe.,2,0,14
Still trying to break them in. They really seem to fatigue my feet on a normal 10000 step day. Not sure how they will hold up backpacking and on trails and rocks. Don’t like them as much as my Walk DMX. Hoping they do fine when I get the broken in a little better. Not my favorite right out of the box,3,0,14
This show is not waterproof. The webbed part that covers the top of your foot leaks like crazy. I got caught in a rainstorm and my feet and socks were soaked,1,0,14
It was so hard felt like a brick.... And the size is bigger! Disappointed by the description and the material.,1,0,14
Wearing these shoes really hurt my arches. Not satisfied with how they feel.,1,0,14
I got these shoes for light outside activities. After wearing them for 2 days the back of the shoe is coming off! I have not been tough on them at all! Would hoping they were going to last at least a little longer than 2 days but I guess not.,2,0,14
First pair of shoes I purchased on Amazon that absolutely didn't fit. I went a half-size larger and still way too small. And I could tell the shoe would be uncomfortable even if they did fit. Very firm - no cushion.,2,0,14
"I have a pair of the AX2s, which were wonderful. I ordered the exact same size and these were waaaaaaay smaller. Like at least a whole size smaller. How about some consistently Adidas???",1,0,14
Very poor quality after 3 months of mild use the shoes are coming apart at the seem. Very poor quality upper but the grip is amazing.,1,0,14
Wanted to like them but they are too tight in the toe area. Seem to be well made otherwise. I like how they look too which is why I bought them but I don’t wear uncomfortable shoes.,3,0,14
"I was hopeful that these shoes would last me at least a year. Alas, almost a month to the day later, the sole is already beginning to separate. Thoroughly disappointed. I hadn't even put many miles on it yet, primarily wearing it to work where I have spent a majority of my time in the office.",1,0,14
The sole is too hard and inflexible and the heel cup is loose. No bueno!,2,0,14
"Shoes couldn't have been much worse the cushion under the foot itself is incredibly thin, the toe box is incredibly stiff so my toes just smash against the sides they dont feel like the shoes support my feet. my feet feel like they are insie a hard box. To put it simply im incredibly disappointed that even after a week of wearing them im still regretting my purchase... never again, you have been warned",1,0,14
"Comfortable, but won't last cheap materials and poor craftsmanship. Durability is 1 star.",3,0,14
"If you have narrow a narrow toe box, these are too narrow for you. Weird... I know...",1,0,14
"At first I loved the shoes. But after a week or so they hurt like crazy! The toe end is so squished together. I got blisters on both feet. They also are not very ""water resistant."" Stopped wearing them already. Sad.",2,0,14
Well they are awesome shoes only if we received and left and a right shoe. We received 2 right shoes,3,0,14
the soles of these shoes slant or slouch to the outside not allowing me to stand or walk in a neutral position. soles are thick on the inside and slant down to the outside. feels like im walking on my 5th metatarsal.,2,0,14
"On a smaller side, hard/stiff, weird fit especially when standing on flat and even surface. Very uncomfortable.
Cannot recommend.",1,0,14
20+ year Adidas wearer and have been a size 12 for 90% of this time. Always fit. I also only buy Adidas for the more relaxed fit through the shoe. This pair were SO tight in the width behind the toes. My feet hurt for hours after wearing them. Returned.,1,0,14
"I bought this pair of shoes for trekking and walking. This shoe is the most uncomfortable I have ever owned! I tried it on a few times hoping to break in these shoes, but my feet would hurt, and I had to stop wearing them for fear of injury to my feet. Bad purchase - very disappointed",1,0,14
"These seemed great at first, but the price they did not last. After about 3 months of normal wear they are coming apart at the soles. Will likely not purchase another adidas product.",2,0,14
"Disappointed. Looks like amazing tread , with good grip. Unfortunately, I'd like Adidas to make them with a little bit more of a wiggle room for those who wear wool or different types of hiking socks. With regular ""thin"" socks they fit just fine.",2,0,14
"I received used shoes. The tips of the shoes show scratches, the inner heel cushioning is broken, and the soles are worn. I cannot return these items because they were shipped internationally from my mailbox in Miami.",1,0,14
"was hoping for a little more cushion for hiking shoe, not bad.",3,0,14
Horrible fit. Something inside the shoes kept rubbing and digging into my foot.,1,0,14
Fell apart in 3 months,1,0,14
"The shoes look good, and felt pretty good except for the area by the heel. For whatever reason, on both shoes, the area where your inner heel rests has a hard piece of insole or something that causes blisters after wearing the shoes for a short time.",2,0,14
"It felt like I was walking out of the shoe with every step. I customize my lacing patterns, but it didn't seem to matter.",1,0,14
It is not comfortable.,1,0,14
too small 8.5 u.s is my size but these don't fit. walk ins are always better you don't have to deal with this returning crap,2,0,14
"Don't waste your time. These shoes have zero arch support and the sole feels like you're walking on concrete. They look cool, but that's about it.",2,0,14
"They are comfortable, light, But not really water resistant. Took me a week or two to discover that. Disappointing.",3,0,14
It’s tough to buy “fitted” items online but when you follow the size chart and order a larger size and still the product is too small? Lame. The bonus is I have to pay for the return despite following the size chart? Two thumbs down.,1,0,14
I'd like to know how I can stretch one of the shoes wider? I should get a refund due to the mis-representation,2,0,14
"Very good but much lower quality than terrex swift r2 and you you a half size more. I always wear size 13 even other terrex shoe, with this one 13 feel little tight.",3,0,14
"I'm curious what the life expectancy of these shoes is. I've had them for about a month (35 days), and the soles are already junk. Different treads on each shoe are now completely flat. I know these are inexpensive, but I'm floored at how cheap the soles are. These will be useless after 6 weeks of use. Pathetic.",2,0,14
"On wet ground, they are extremely slippery!! Would not purchase again.",2,0,14
