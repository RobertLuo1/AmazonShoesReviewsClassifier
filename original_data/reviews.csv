"When they arrived, they looked larger than the normal 11 mids that I usually get. I checked the label inside and it shows the US size as 11-12. As I am more like size 10-3/4, I was concerned as I hate loose sneakers. Turns out that they are only slightly larger than a standard size 11 and were the perfect size for a gel insert to be added. They are light and comfortable and since I put inserts in about half of the sneakers that I buy, for this price, I find these a good deal for the money. The air soles on these actually work to reduce shock to the heel. No durability info as yet but I would recommend these for an inexpensive everyday walking around sneaker. Folks that run a lot probably wouldn't be looking in this price-point anyway, so I would not recommend for folks that heap serious abuse on their running shoes. For the average Joe, I would recommend these.",4,1,8
I have purchased three pairs of these shoes in a couple of colors and am totally satisfied. They look good and I find them to be really comfortable. I use them daily for my five-mile walk. I’ve also worn them on the tennis court. The first pair held up for six months before I thought they were too worn down in the heel. (The rest of the shoe was still in great shape). I thought that was pretty good for an inexpensive shoe.,5,1,8
"I felt totally tricked by Amazon ,I searched for Nike air shoes and they advertised these as Nike,they are not! And the quality and fit are not the same, the shoe felt like a flat tire . I was really dissapointed and offended until I found out it would cost 6.00 just to return them. Now I'm pissed",1,0,8
"I have purchased some unbranded sneakers from Amazon before with comparable price and they not even close when it comes to the thoughtful design and good quality. They are little bit tight and I have to remove the sole padding and replaced them with sole T75 heel and arch support. I have multiple foot issues, notably, burning sensation on the sole once I put on a pair of shoes, and this pair reduced the pain a little bit, and so elated to welcome the little improvement. Another thing is it’s an attentions getter. My coworkers noticed them and I got a lot of nice compliments. I recommend thede shoes!",4,1,8
Love em!,4,1,8
Just know you are buying a knock off,1,0,8
 These shoes fit my son perfect. They look so much like another name brand. He loves them and i loves the cost. These shoes are very stylish and easy to keep clean. With the speed his feet grow i love the value i got from these.they fit true to size and he really likes the look of them.,5,1,8
Great sport running shoes for my husband. They are so comfortable and so soft. He is in love with running every morning and sport. So this pair of shoes are great for him. He will buy for sure one more pair (another color). High quality for a perfect affordable price. Highly recommend,5,1,8
"The Shoes have terrible cushion. After using them 3 to 4 times for a slow jog and mostly walking it feels like the heels have as much cushion as a pair of $.99 cheap flip fop sandals . Totally disappointed, as they look good but they are not for exercise use.
And now I am stuck with 2 pairs, since I missed the return period by 6 days",1,0,8
"WTH... I searched Nike.. was looking for Nike. Had a shoe that cost the same as this.... THAT WAS NIKE yet somehow I failed to notice because of the CHEATING BRAND STEALING KNOCK-OFFS.. is that how China is planing on betting the west?

"These shoes I ordered were 1 of 4 different pairs / brands. With that being said they were the only off brand I bought. So these shoes are WORTH the low price. They are VERY comfortable, and also true to size. I wear these shoes almost daily and so far ( I've had them for about 2 weeks now) there my favorite. I live in Alaska and wear these on nice sunny days with a red & or Black sweat suit. I definitely recommend getting a pair. Also they come in a really little cool shoes bag that makes them different than the regular shoe box. This brand / style is the only one I've bought from this company, but I will definitely be buying shoes from them again. I wear size 12 and these fit perfect.",5,1,8
Mi hijo los ordenó y dice que le quedaron bien y que le gustan los zapatos y son cómodo para caminar y correr,4,1,8
"It is a comfortable shoe don""t expect too much though you get what you pay for. They are lightweight and been using them at the time I'm writing this about a month and i cant complain w i where them always everywhere. The only gripe I have is the shoestrings not long enough and that if you're a runner you might to break these in before you do any serious running including lacing the shoes.",5,1,8
"Very comfortable shoes to walk, run, jog, or to work in...I've already ordered 3 different pairs!! I use a pair for my Treadmill, a pair to do my chores in , and a pair to go out on the day in. I Love thst the shoes come with a string pull bag to carry around with you!! Nice!!",5,1,8
"I didn't realize until they arrived in a bag that they weren't from the major shoe company I thought they were produced by. Who knew that ""AIR' isn't trademarked by a certain large company? ;) My mistake, but they do seem comfy enough and will do the trick for the limited amount of wear I plan to put on them. Not bad for the price.",4,1,8
I love the look of this shoe. feels nice on the foot. the soles feel like plastic instead of rubber so they don't offer great traction. I feel as though I am about to slip when I'm wearing them. And I do use these for work. other than that the shoe is great,3,0,8
"Very comfortable but soles don’t last long. I got these in May and wore them a lot but only to work and the store. I’m in IT so I do a mix of sitting, standing, and walking around the office. I never did yard work, exercise, or anything else but the basics. The soles are already splitting on both pairs. It’s a shame, these are really comfortable albeit a slight bit tight. If you still get some of these and you teeter between 10.5/11 go with the 11 IMO, it was a bit tight for me but not painful.",2,0,8
Comfortable and nice fit. A little heavy by today's standards but I really couldn't complain UNTIL 5 months of 3-5 days a week wear and the bottoms of BOTH shoes spilt. Wear wasn't even that bad on either tread. They just split!! Very disappointing,2,0,8
I really liked the look of these shoes. They fit well but the bottoms were very cheap looking. It seemed to be a foam rubber with a plastic coating instead of a solid color rubber. I looked at a few reviews and saw photos of how quickly the bottoms of these shoes break down. Too bad because they looked nice otherwise. I actually returned these quickly and went to the Nike outlet store.,1,0,8
"Hey, for cheap shoes, these aren't bad! A little narrow, but they stretch a lil bit. But honestly, they're comfy and they look great. A lot like airmax at a quick glance. I wear airmax 17 daily and I needed some tennis shoes for work so I bought these; not much of a difference! These fit the bill perfectly. I'll be back with a one month review December 7th.",4,1,8
"These shoes are absolutely amazing. They're super comfortable and also very cheap. They feel very flexible. The shoes aren't too tight and not too loose either. They feel super comfy and natural. I tried them both for jogging and playing tennis and couldn't see any difference with the other branded shoes.. Amazing shoes, would definitely recommend.",5,1,8
" The shoes were comfortable but the air bubble in shoes was flat. I would not buy these shoes again.
You can tell that the plastic will not last during workouts.",2,0,8
I seached mens NIKE shoes..these pooped up...i got fooled ...these shoes are piece of crap off brand...very poor quality....did not think i would get something like this from Amazon....More like something that would come from Wish from China...But it was my fault .I got $10 shoes for $40.lol...,1,0,8
"Decent shoe, but the fit is a bit larger than true to size. Shoe is also heavy, especially in the heel. The sole seems to wear quickly and doesn’t have much tread. Even though ad says shoes work for tennis and running, that is not true. It’s not a good shoe for tennis or running.",2,0,8
"The shoes arrived as described. I loved the color and style, but were a little smaller than the 10.5 size that I wear. Probably would order a half size up for better comfort. I wore them to work, and half way through my shift I could feel my large toe rubbing against the inside.",3,0,8
"The view from Amazon shows Nike air max,
they are anything but, poorly made product that has not refunded me yet",1,0,8
when standing in these starting middle to the tip of the toes it is extremely soft. Good for around the house and walking but I would not run in these and surely wouldnt do squats. But over all it is a good value for the money spent. Does fit about a half size larger than Nike.,5,1,8
"I have bought this product for gifting to my nephew he loves it. Quote ""makes you feel like walking more super cushion underneath. Can't wait to play basketball this weekend. "" We love because it came with a black laced bag to place shoes inside looks super luxurious i love it feel super strong. No funky smell fast shipping. If you are looking for some new kicks with a bit of style guys this is it fits perfectly on feet for an affordable price. I definitely recommend I bought 2 different style pairs i don't regret it at all my nephew loves his new kicks. #SportsShoes #Perfectfit",5,1,8
Te hacen creer que es un producto de la marca Nike y simplemente llega una réplica,1,0,8
"Too small so I'm returning. I looked at the shoe to verify that it was the size I ordered but the American size isn't even printed on the shoe, just the EU and CH sizes but apparently it was supposed to be size 9.",1,0,8
Shoe fits well - seems well made - and it was very comfortable even on its first wearing (some new shoes can be stiff). I highly recommend.,5,1,8
"This is a case of you get what you pay for. They fit OK, but the soles are slippery when you walk, no support. Will not buy again.",1,0,8
"fit well and look good. i am using for tennis and although they might be great for walking we will see how they
hold up to a tennis court. to be determined?",4,1,8
"Nice lightweight, very comfortable, great work for working out. I bought them for my husband and he loves them, he said they are his most comfortable shoes he's had for working out in. I'd recommend.",4,1,8
I did not know what to expect on these shoes but I’m surprised that it looks great and wears very well. I’m over 200 lbs and looking at buying a new pair new color.,5,1,8
"Can't say I dislike anything, we'll see how they hold up.
shoes fit as expected, I wear a sz 10 & these fit good, you'll need some time for break-in, a day or two..
I wear them every day..",5,1,8
Muy lindo diseño y le resultaron muy prácticas y cómodas a mi sobrino que fue a quien se las regale !! Le encantaron y las usa para todo ocasión . Fácil de lavar,5,1,8
Its not name brand but its fits my budget. This Chinese Nike knockoff brand is lightweight and comfortable but dont know about the longjevity of the shoe.,4,1,8
"Not what I expected at all. When I seen the word air on the shoes I immediately expected Nike. Don't fool yourself, these are not Nike brand at all. The feel of the shoes is an immediate turn off. I returned these first chance.",1,0,8
Esthetically looks good. Lightweight but not structurally balanced. Material attached to sole allows to much tolerance which makes shoe list inwards. I am speaking from a runners perspective. Good price however.,2,0,8
"These were returned due to misleading categorization and my error in catching that. I specifically searched for ""Nike"" shoes and these were among the choices. I quickly glanced and saw ""Air"" and wrongly assumed by my search and familiar shoe markings, that I was buying what I intended. They arrived in an unfamiliar bag. That's when I realized there wasn't a Nike swoosh to be found. I then noticed the stitching was crooked. Thankfully I was able to return them at a nearby Kohl's store.",1,0,8
"The shoes are way too big. 3-4 size bigger than one will expect. Lost of money, or one has to wait for 2-3 years to wear them. Very frustrating…",1,0,8
This are very comfortable walking shoes. I walk a lot for my job and they feel very good on my feet. I'm just hoping they last long and continue feeling good.,5,1,8
"These are some everyday essentials for that comfort and to run around on errand day. They are light weight, fashionable and breathable. Great knock off version and material.",5,1,8
"The fit, look and comfort are great. I'm a big 300+lbs guy and I got them for walking and the gym. I am hard on shoes. So far, so good. Theyre comfortsble and the price is great too.",4,1,8
Purchased for a young one and could not really use the shoe. Fortunately the kid likes the look but complains about how stiff and uncomfortable for fast walking or running on a regular 400m track. Shoe feels cheap; now wonder if should have gone to a brand name outlet to spend $10 more and get a more decent shoe.,2,0,8
Thought these were Nike but was pleasantly surprised when I tried them on. Very comfortable and they look great!! I would buy this brand again.,5,1,8
"Great shoes at a great price. I use these at the gym and run with them occasionally, but also wear them out. Very comfortable. I am normally a size 11 and they fit true to size, for me. They are a little slick on the bottom, but that hasn't bothered me.",5,1,8
They look great they feel great just don't wear them. Very poor durability,2,0,8
"Estaba buscando unos tenis que fueran comodos para trabajar, encontre estos pero no estaba seguro si comprarlos, y me arriesgue. Cuando lo recibi quede sorprendido, se ven super bonitos, ligeros y los mas importante super comodos. No tiendo a comprar zapatos en linea porque soy un poco complicado pero puedo decir que estos me quedaron perfectos.",5,1,8
"Son muy bonitos pero pensé que se lo iba a sentir super suave, tal vez porque son nuevos. Lo compré para trotar",5,1,8
"I did not know this until I ware this but heel lift is too high enough to feel uncomfortable.
This may not be fit for running.

"Horrible running shoes don't buy .
After 2 month using
I Have now issues with foot . Need to remove from Amazon asap",1,0,8
Not as expected....Heavier than expected....Hard sole giving no cushioning effect....Left foot toes started hurting badly after wearing these shoes for only a day...Being a veteran I feel no difference in wearing the military boots and this so called running pair of shoes.,3,0,8
"Really a very comfortable athletic shoe/sneaker for the money. Using them for work outs. Walking, etc. Can't beat the price. So tired of spending a couple hundred plus for a nice pair of sneakers.
We'll see how long they last but for the price I'll get my money's worth. To bad they're made in China. Couldn't ignore the price. So far, satisfied with this purchase.",4,1,8
"My boyfriend got these thinking they were Nike’s for some reason, he was a little disappointed.

But they seem like fine shoes! No problems except he didn’t read the listing lol",4,1,8
"I put the sneakers on they were light weight, comfortable and fit good. I will purchase another pair",5,1,8
"It’s comfortable for walking🚶‍♀️ .jogging.🏃‍♂️ But If it was a brand or name of the shoe, it would have been better.
this important",4,1,8
"I am not a big fan of buying shoes online because of the size issues but these shoes fit me exactly, I am a 9.5 and they are just right. For the money these shoes are great, comfortable out of the box, no need to break them in. I walk a lot at my job on hard floors and these are pretty nice shoes for that. Worth the money and they have a good look to them, I am a happy customer, thanks.",4,1,8
These are not mikes pay attention and don't go by the air on the side of the shoes,1,0,8
"These are supposed to be running shoes. They’re not. Stiff, narrow, very plasticy. I thought I’d give it a try because of the price but man, not worth it. I gave em away even afterwards. Plus is, they don’t look bad while they’re on.",2,0,8
"The bottom looks and feels cheap, bottom may not last a year? The outer shoe looks fantastic....",3,0,8
Omg these are trash,1,0,8
"Very narrow and slightly short! I wear a 10D and this barely fit. I tried to tie them tight enough to push my heel back, but it didn't help much. The sole appeared to wear on my first walk, so I returned them!
THANK YOU AMAZON FOR YOUR GREAT RETURN POLICY!!",1,0,8
"I really like the style and feel of the shoe, but I don't feel like these shoes are good for tennis. They're super comfortable and has a lot of cushion, but when you need to move laterally, the extra cushion makes it feel like you're going to roll your ankles. Great Great running, not for tennis.",2,0,8
I bought these as an extra pair of shoes to use for walking. The shoes are very comfortable to wear.,5,1,8
Both times I ordered size 9 W and both times they were delivered as narrow or regular. I use them for working out and they are very lightweight,3,0,8
The bubble popped in the left shoe so I sound like a dog's squeaky toy wherever I go. My feet hurt although I bought improved insoles. I walk a lot at work and I get blisters every night. I wish there was a readily available product for someone who walks 12-15 miles a day on concrete.,3,0,8
"This shoe is really comfortable but the problem I had with the shoes was that they were delivered in a bag instead of a box like most shoes are delivered in. I believe because they were in a bag, it cause the shoes to be smashed in at the large toe on both and it's a permanent dip in the shoes. I hope they start using boxes and protect to shoes soon.",2,0,8
Thought I was buying Nike air. Nope. Chinese junk low in comfort. look good though.,2,0,8
These are very comfortable to wear for working out. Walking. Very affordable.,5,1,8
These are junk. Last about 2 months so there's that. I wouldn't recommend anyone who wants to work or walk in these!!,1,0,8
I bought these for my son and not only are they very narrow the soles came came out the 2nd day. 3 weeks in and the entire bottom of the shoe tore open,2,0,8
"I was totally misled by this product and I’m disappointed with Amazon for allowing them to false advertise. I thought I was buying Nikes, to be very clear THESE ARE NOT NIKE’S!!!! I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried them and they are uncomfortable and my feet were sore. I am returning them as they are complete garbage.",1,0,8
"I got these as a gift for my boyfriend he loves them as soon as he opened them he put them on right away he was patiently waiting for them looking out the door every 5 minutes and once he got him he was happy
. Finally he looks good lol",5,1,8
Hubby says this shoe was smaller than true size but is comfortable and nice looking.,4,1,8
I ordered these thinking I was getting a big discount on some actual authentic Nike Air Max shoes and realized my mistake almost immediately. I was going to return them upon receipt but when I saw how good they looked I decided to try them on and they were VERY comfortable. I'm considering purchasing some more in other colors.,4,1,8
Super comfortable these shoes. totally recommend it,5,1,8
Terrible. No support! Look nice but not a good shoe,1,0,8

I normally wear a shoe size 12 to 13. I got these shoes in a size 12 and they fit like a size 11 1/2. Just too small. The shoe is good quality for the price. I would consider buying them again if they had a 13. but since they do not I will go elsewhere.,4,1,8
I really like this walking shoe very comfortable good look for the price. I am very satisfied with them. The only thing I don't like is the tongue is to long. I am just wearing this shoe around the house and everyday use. I would buy them again.,4,1,8

Very nice sneakers comfortable,5,1,8
"The shoes look nice but they're huge! I currently wear size 11 Nike shoes and these new ones have more than an inch of space at the toe. I look at the tag and the size is 11-12. That was not disclosed in the ad.

Bought these for my 11 year old. They are comfortable but the fabric is thick and heavy. They take forever to dry when he gets in wet grass. They stunk horribly within the first week.,3,0,8
Love the look and how it feels on my feet,5,1,8
Very comfortable and not too expensive!,5,1,8
Could have used a little more width,5,1,8
So far they're good shoes.. very comfortable. They're comparable to the $90 Nike Tourch shoes that I got. I use them mostly for work because I am walking/standing on solid concrete all day and my feet hurt. These help with that tremendously,4,1,8
Very comfortable,5,1,8

Ordered these for my brother. He said these are not true Nikes. He said they fit too small and that the material is not of Nike quality. He believes they are knockoffs. I do not recommend getting these shoes. Hoping he can get them back to me in time to send them back for a refund.,1,0,8
"I have normal 10.5 size feet, these cross trainers were so tight they actually hurt my feet, no amount of wearing them in would have stretched them to where I needed them to be comfortable, I will not be ordering Nike products online again and it took 2 weeks to be delivered, not happy!",1,0,8
"Pretty good workout shoe. Low profile light weight. Firm sole..
The 'Wide' is still rather tight.",4,1,8
My girlfriend bough these as a gift for me and they were super comfy and not as narrow as other Nike shoes I’ve worn. Would definitely recommend these if you like wider shoes.,5,1,8
"My husband loves these shoes, he said "" these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had"" They are great and look good too. The grey color goes with everything.",5,1,8

excelente Recomendado,5,1,8
"I ordered these shoes in 9 extra wide (4E), but there were too tight. I have a pair of Nike Revolution 4 in the same size that fit perfect. I’m not sure why these run so small, but there should be consistency across Nike’s different models.",3,0,8
My Grandson loves them.,5,1,8
The size 4E is more like 2E. I compared it to my other Nike. The bottom of the shoes are the same width but the top material of this shoe is narrower and tight on top of the toes.,2,0,8
Very comfortable shoe.,5,1,8
Bueno,5,1,8

These shoes look great and fit great as well. I am very happy with my purchase. This is my first time buying shoes online as I normally want to try them on in person. I took a chance buying these and I'm so glad I did.,5,1,8
"I needed new shoes desperately so I spent some $$ ($82 to be exact) on some nice, comfortable looking “nikes” but when I got them, they were the wrong color first off. Second, they’re complete knock offs. I compared them to my other pair of nikes and the swoosh, every bit of material is different and low quality. I didn’t expect knockoffs especially ones for $80!! So I returned them immediately and went on nike.com. They had sales on all their footwear so moral of the story, if you want brand name, go to the website 👏🏽",1,0,8
arrived on time. my order was just what l order. will buy again,5,1,8
"These shoes are comfortable when walking and standing, for long periods of time.",5,1,8
They look great and feel very comfortable!,5,1,8
Super cómodos,5,1,8
"The back of these shoes will dig in to your heel and make you bleed also the inside sole is oddly shaped and never conforms to your feet. Worst shoe I've ever bought. It's as if someone looked at a perfectly good shoe and thought ""how could we make these unwearable and as uncomfortable as possible...I know! Let's make it feel like there is a knife scraping your heel!"" Its too late to return these for me so instead of donating then to some homeless guy and making their life worse I'm just going to throw them out and leave this review to warn anyone else. DONT BUY THIS SHOE!!!",1,0,8
I've been wearing black Nikes for 5 years now. They are a simple comfortable shoe that has quality laces and sturdy design. Very lightweight and ergonomic. I'll buy another pair in about a year.,5,1,8
"Nothing to dislike, killer style and super comfort. Highly recommended",5,1,8
They snd me a copied version of that shoe,1,0,8
Simply loving the Design and Comfort beautiful piece.....,5,1,8

I bought these shoes thinking they would make my feet look invisible at night but when my brother said he liked my new shoes at like 10:00 I got really upset and sunk another 50 bucks on invisible spray paint that didn’t work either,4,1,8
"as a lifelong Nike fan, I have had dozens of their shoes. This is definitely the most comfortable for walking or easy jogging. Very versatile and I like them a lot. Assuming they continue making them I will buy another pair before long.",5,1,8
I used the Nike Free RN new and straight out of the box and did two miles on the treadmill at a 15-minute mike pace. It was basically a very slow jog and the soles are so flimsy that the wear looks like I’ve run on them for a month. Your can actually see layers peeling off. Save your money. The shoes have style but zero substance.,1,0,8
Comfortable! Easily the Best shoe I have ever owned. You won’t regret buying this shoe. Anyone who gives it a negative review must have been paid.,5,1,8
"Not a comfortable sneakers. If I wear them all day my feet and legs hurt. The cushion is really flat and you feel the concrete under your feet.
Too much money to spend for not such a great sneaker",2,0,8
I bought these shoes for my 17 y/o son. He usually wears them 2-3 a week. He said they are very comfortable!,3,0,8
"This particular issue is amazingly comfortable and has really helped to ease the foot pain I have been having because of the excellent sole flexibility and cushioning. This shoe is very light and comfortable and can actually be slipped on and off because it is slightly elastic in the upper, which makes it feel a bit snug but overall one of the best athletic shoes I have ever purchased",5,1,8
"Somethings off about these shoes, also the size is way smaller then a size 13 men’s would be. They seem lower quality then the other pair I owned in 2018.",1,0,8
i am satisfied with the fit and comfort,5,1,8
"Not sure why this is the only 2018 RN on Amazon right now, but they fit perfectly, are super comfortable (like the previous 5 5.0's that I've had). They do look quite a bit different than older styles...way better in my opinion!...lots of new details. The delivery was super-fast!! May get another style...",5,1,8
The color was the reason I picked this shoes... very frickin disappointed. I'm thinking of returning them. False advertising.,1,0,8

This a very comfortable shoe-but the sole makes a lot of noise.,3,0,8
Shoe fit right awesome product,5,1,8
I have these same exact shoes and I ordered the same size as my tag shows and the shoes that came are HUGE. Tag shows the size I ordered but definitely not accurate. Extremely disappointed.,1,0,8

Just a bit snug. But otherwise great.,4,1,8
Love this product.,5,1,8
"First off, I am an avid runner and have been running exclusively on Nike Free’s for over a decade. These shoes are comfortable, but they are moving backwards in design. Rocks and debris stick in the tread more than ever. The shoes are hotter, so my feet expand and my toes bruise more (I live in South Florida and it’s July). The back “lip” doesn’t let your runners socks cover and causes blisters. This is not the best Nike Free, but it’s better than your traditional Nike runner. i run everyday with a long run once a week and my toes are bruised and nails black. This hasn’t happened since I stopped wearing cotton socks. Nike go back to your previous design...much better! I love the design to natural motion as it creates a basis for less injury and will still run in these shoes, but there’s been better before this one.",2,0,8
"So, I like these running shoes so much and find them so comfortable that I ordered a new pair, but I thought I'd share a comparison of the old and new shoes so you can see how the shoes wore (with me); and their pebble collecting feature is unbeatable.

Why I like them: I have flat feet and can't tolerate any arch support whatsoever. If there's the teenist amount of arch support, the pain is intense. These provide none. They're like wearing super cushy moccasins, which is the reason I initially bought them; and am eternally grateful to have them.

Your pebble collection: The design of the soles are genius for collecting stones of all kinds. You won't notice them while running, but I keep a little screwdriver handy to pick away at the stones from time to time (not while I'm running but once I'm home). It's actually kinda meditative. I also have a pair for walking, and only walking, and while strolling in Potsdam, at Sanssouci, where King Frederick's paths are paved with pebbles, they must have lost at least a third of their pebbles to my shoes. Never noticed though.

I'm a light runner. I might do two miles a day, 10 to 12 miles a week. I've had the blue shoes for 5 years now? Only about a third of my running is on pavement. Most of it is on paths and dirt roads (also excellent areas for pebble collectors).

They will not keep your feet dry. But they also don't soak up water. I've run in the rain with them and they dry out overnight.

The fit is tricky. I bought a leather version (for walking) of these shoes and had to buy a half size up from the (nylon?) mesh versions.

I was tempted to give them four stars, but the unrivaled pebble collecting feature easily bumped the shoes to five.",5,1,8
"I found a pair of these at my local Nike Factory store (size 10.5, black/anthracite color). They are VERY comfortable out of the box - the sole is soft and the feeling when putting on the shoe is similar to that of putting on an extra sock (it is snug, stretchy, and yet not too tight). The high heel tab (that supports your Achilles heel) is very soft and makes the shoe even more comfortable. Also, the shoe is very bendable/stretchable. In terms of fit, I normally wear size 10 dress shoes and size 10.5 athletic shoes. I tried both the 10 and 10.5 and felt better with the 10.5. So I would say - go with your usual athletic shoes size or go 1/2 size larger than your dress shoe size.",5,1,8
"The design of these shoes causes them to squeak with each and every step. It doesn't discriminate what surface you walk on, it squeaks regardless.",2,0,8
After a few months of wear I put on the shoes and as I tried to lace them up the lace holes ripped open. No way to fix them. Who knows? Maybe they're not even legit Nikes.,1,0,8
"Comfortable...check! Stylish...check! My basketball shooting skills have increased 23.45%...check! I now run more like a gazelle than a rhinoceros...check! While it may be impossible to quantify the true impact these shoes have on my life, what I do know is that when you’re shoes are comfortable and you feel light footed and confident in your overall presentation...anything is possible. When you’re a 43 year old guy like me and you put these shoes on, I feel like I’m 23.",5,1,8
"it appeared to me that these particular shoes have ""made the rounds"" so to speak. box was damaged, and I would bet good money that more than one person has returned this particular pair of shoes.

I did like the styling, bought another pair from a different source and ended up saving $16.",1,0,8
"I purchased these sneakers to wear during our trip to Universal Studios Orlando. I know that we will be walking around a lot and I want something comfortable and stylish to wear. These kicks fit the bill.

Style

They are extremely good looking. Much more so than I thought when I saw them online. I love the detail in the design and I have been wearing them whenever I can since I purchased them.

Comfort

The shoes are also very comfortable. The air cushioning and padding in the shoes keeps my footsies feeling great all day long. These are now one of my go to comfy shoes.

Recommendation

If you are looking for shoes that look great and are as comfortable as a cloud of air you need to pick these up.",5,1,8
"My husband has been on this particular shoe style for roughly 6 years now, and because he refuses to try a different style - I was relieved that Amazon saved my behind and had these. He loves them, they are the perfect fit and comfortable. He is on his feet for no less than 15 hours a day and I never hear complaints.",5,1,8
Fast shipping. Shoe look like floor model; one worn and one not. Very wide. Too wide. Tried to send back but UPS didnt pick up; then they refused the label and wanted to charge me so I went home and tried to get a new one. It generated the same old ticket. Wrote to Amazon but no reply > guess big bucks doesn't have time for those who put bread on his table.,3,0,8
"I dont usually buy sneakers for more than $50, but with arthritis in my knees, I needed to spend the extra for support. Not only did they help with walking but in a world of neons and fancy colors the black and silver gets noticed when I wear them out. Great sneakers",5,1,8
"I'm giving this two stars because they are uncomfortable. I work a part time job at Lowes 3 or 4 nights week. They only 4 he shifts, by the 3rd hour my feet are killing me and I cant wait to get them off. Other than that, they seem to be well made and are holding up, they are just uncomfortable.",2,0,8
"I was able to remove the insoles without much trouble so that I could put in insoles with good arch support. The tread is really nice. Sneakers seem to run smaller than regular shoes so I had to order a half size larger than I normally wear in my regular shoes. This is the third try on sneakers, three different brands but I ordered these a half size bigger.",5,1,8
This is the 2nd pair of these shoes purchased for my son. He has a wide foot and high arch so he needs the room at the top of the shoe to tie comfortably. He loves the shoe,5,1,8

Fractured foot years ago and has given me issues ever since. Have to be particular about my shoes and these are great.,5,1,8
Have worn this Nike style for several years. Always purchased from a local store. This is my first pair from Amazon. Felt small but thought they just needed to be broken in. They still are the same feel after a couple months. No way these are the size indicated. Would return but outside return period.,1,0,8
"Though all details imply a good show, it was just too small for me. And I have other Nike's so would think the sizes run similar but not even close. Much too small.",3,0,8

"Nike Sizing Info:
Ladies, if you want to wear this shoe...I'm a 9 in Women's Nike which is equal to 26cm. This shoe's Men's size equalling 26cm is an 8. If you have your favorite perfect fitting Nike shoe, they print the size on centimeters on the tag under the tongue of the shoe.

I like the color styling for the men's version of this shoe better than the dull black looking women's version. Also...this shoe is currently $70 at Academy sports website and their sizes are all available. Finding this shoe in my size on Amazon has been a butt pain. They're wider than the usual Nike design which is exactly what I need.

I received the shoes from this merchant in a semi-beat up Nike shoe box held together with a giant rubberband but the quality of the shoe was perfect. I just had to return due me getting the size wrong.",5,1,8

Great fit very light on feet definitely pleased with my choice,4,1,8
"Lo compré y menqiedo como lo esperaba, un zapato comodobinito y que combina con todo.",5,1,8
Great fit and super comfortable,5,1,8
"Mi esposo quedó encantado lo recomiendo
Compren su talla normal 🥰",5,1,8
Good product,5,1,8
"Shoe is very hot. My feet don’t sweat a lot but for some reason, this shoe just retains heat and moisture. Not well ventilated. After a few workouts, they began to smell.",2,0,8
These shoes were tight and uncomfortable. I wore to work for a week in a restaurant environment and boy did my back and feet hurt. Shhhhizzzle I was in pain. Will not buy again!!!,2,0,8
My husband wears 9.5-10 and he bought a 10. The 10 fits perfectly.,5,1,8
Fractured foot years ago and has given me issues ever since. Have to be particular about my shoes and these are great.,5,1,8
Have worn this Nike style for several years. Always purchased from a local store. This is my first pair from Amazon. Felt small but thought they just needed to be broken in. They still are the same feel after a couple months. No way these are the size indicated. Would return but outside return period.,1,0,8
"Though all details imply a good show, it was just too small for me. And I have other Nike's so would think the sizes run similar but not even close. Much too small.",3,0,8
Ok,5,1,8
Great sneaker fits great!,5,1,8
They are ok for that kind of money,4,1,8
"Great shoe, look sharp and are super comfortable. They do feel a little slick on water though, but overall great shoe.",5,1,8
I really liked these sneakers. They looked really good on me but I ordered them a half size too small. I have to compliment the seller on a speedy delivery and a no hassle return.,4,1,8
"Gran producto, excelente vendedor, lo recomiendo",5,1,8
"I really like this shoe. It fits perfectly and wears well. I stand all day at work, and this shoe is very comfortable!",5,1,8
Too narrow. But my foot runs wide. No pun intended.,4,1,8
My fiancee loves the comfort and fashionable look,5,1,8
"The shoe is good, but the price is much higher than what I paid for the same shoe 5 yyears ago. It arrived when expected.",4,1,8
Nice running shoes. Look great and good quality you expect from Nike.,5,1,8
"Cumfy, durable, light weight, ""fashion"". I like em.",5,1,8
Needed wide width,1,0,8
Hubby likes & enjoys wearing. Comfortable shoe,5,1,8
"After a few initial days wearing them, l decided to spent another $50 on new insoles. Even with the new insoles they are extremely uncomfortable. A waste of money. Adidas shoes are more comfortable. Last pair of Nike I buy.",1,0,8
Bought for a friend he loves them and the fact that they aren't all clothe like other nikes,4,1,8
Great tennis...i love it,5,1,8

"Nike Sizing Info:
Ladies, if you want to wear this shoe...I'm a 9 in Women's Nike which is equal to 26cm. This shoe's Men's size equalling 26cm is an 8. If you have your favorite perfect fitting Nike shoe, they print the size on centimeters on the tag under the tongue of the shoe.

I like the color styling for the men's version of this shoe better than the dull black looking women's version. Also...this shoe is currently $70 at Academy sports website and their sizes are all available. Finding this shoe in my size on Amazon has been a butt pain. They're wider than the usual Nike design which is exactly what I need.

I received the shoes from this merchant in a semi-beat up Nike shoe box held together with a giant rubberband but the quality of the shoe was perfect. I just had to return due me getting the size wrong.",5,1,8
One of the shoe is small and one fits perfectly,3,0,8

"the absolute BEST shoes I've EVER worn.
these shoes have lasted me for 3 years now, and they're still comfortable as hell, despite the normal wear on the sole. they are extremely durable, super comfortable, look awesome, and the fact I still wear them and love them after 3 years speaks volumes on the quality you get from Nike...the best shoes, the best company...hands down!",5,1,8
These are junk. Completely dead in 6 months. Paid $80 for these to start falling apart in just a few months.... Nike is junk. Havent paid for nikes since buying these.,2,0,8
No sé qué pasó con esta compra pues pedí un size 9.5 de hombre y me mandaron un size 12! No podía creerlo cuando mi esposo muy emocionado abrió la caja (era su regalo de cumpleaños) y se encontró unos tenis enormes!,1,0,8
These are about the only shoes I have found that that are great for my high arches. I wear them for an average of 1 1/2 - 2 years and I run 3-4 times a week. The main reason I replace them is because I also wear them for everyday shoes including yard work.,5,1,8
"Way too small in the width. I ordered the 14 in black. ALL other shoes, in that size, fit perfectly, but these. Stinks! Really love the look of this one!",2,0,8
"Very attractive and comfortable shoe I bought from a well known sporting goods store much less than amazon and it's sponsors, I highly recommend.

I had these same exact shoes i brought from shoe carnival in 2018 for $80 in black. They are good fit and wore them for work for almost a year. I would get them again but not for over $100 up here.,5,1,8
I've had this shoe for around 2 years or so. Great shoe and would buy again but I originally bought them for $64 and now they are $93 for my size. Not a chance lol,3,0,8
Like the colors,4,1,8
"Typically, I try not to spend more than $50 for a tennis shoes, but my sciatica has become more difficult to walk, as well as, stand at work or even trying to exercise. I’ve put on so much weight not being able to walk and exercise because of the pain in my leg and foot. Now I’ve arrived at the point that my health is more important so I spent the money 💵 and VERY PLEASED with the support that this shoe provides and going to purchase another pair today.",5,1,8

"Ordered Nike Air max Torch 4 on Amazon and was surprised to get fake Nike’s. I’m hoping to get a full refund. I’m surprised a reputable company like Amazon would sell fake items. It’s illegal to advertise products as originals if they are not. I had asked if they were originals prior to buying them, I was told they were. The material is cheap, does not hug your feet, it’s like walking with bricks on my feet. I quite disappointed with this product. I own numerous pairs of Nike Airs and did research on these shoe, they are definitely fake! Do not buy these shoes.",1,0,8
"Shoes are awesome but had to return them.

Very tide...and the quality is poor,3,0,8
Very good product,5,1,8
Good,5,1,8
Great pair of shoes. I have had them for some time now and I love them. I can't seem to find these in the stores at all so definitely a good find on Amazon.,5,1,8
Shoes are poor quality. I have worn them approximately 10 times and the front of the shoe has frayed and the white Nike symbol had fallen off.,1,0,8
"The Air Max Torch 3 is the Hummer of athletic shoes: it looks large and imposing on the outside, but is tiny and cramped on the inside. I don't know how shoes that look this wide could be so narrow on the inside. The toe box is also tight, and the length of the shoes runs one-half to a full size too small. The shoes I was sent appeared to have used, or at least taken out of the box, before--the shoe box looked like it had been mauled by a cat, see attached picture. Unless you are looking for used shoes that are chunky and painful to wear, look elsewhere. I will try to wear them, but only because I wasted 90 dollars on them.",2,0,8
I have been wearing this shoe for last six months and liked the shoe and decided to order another pair. I believe these are all defect shoes on Amazon for this brand and style. There is a nub that sticks out inside the shoe. It is right next to your big toe and it is EXTREMELY irritating. I ordered the shoe and had the issue then reordered it again and was surprised to see the exact same issue on the next pair. I returned both without any issues.,1,0,8
"These run about 1/2 size small. I wear a women's 9.5-10, and a men's 8.5. The 8.5 is too small. Not sure who says they run true to size, they must like their shoes right up against their toes!! I reordered a 9. If they are good, I will update my review!",4,1,8
Tried them on and walked around the living room. Very stiff and uncomfortable. Knew they weren’t for me. Ended up going to a local DSW and trying on a pair of ASICS that felt comfortable immediately so I got those . I liked the look of the Nikes better but I had to go for comfort because that is the main deal Right? ...Not what some celebrity wears . I have What would be considered a small narrow foot and they were still too tight and cramped feeling.,2,0,8
"I don't really know what it is, but Nike shoes always fit me best. When I originally found the Air Max Torch shoes I really felt like they fit me better than any shoe. They are actually energizing in how they fit so well and how lightweight they are. I am probably on my 5th or 6th pair of Torch 3s and have also invested in a set of Torch 4s because I like them so much!",5,1,8
"Ordered a second pair. I have narrow feet and these fit perfectly. They are true to my size (12D) and although not super padding like some of my Brooks and Hokas, these fit so well that my feet are happier during and after each run. They are the best shoes I have worn in a long time. Wish Nike would keep the 3s around. I will order one more pair before you can't buy them any longer.",5,1,8
"Mine showed up in two days, brand new and never worn. I see a lot of reviews regarding size issues. Get whatever size you wear in Nike shoes and they’ll fit fine. Seems every shoe company’s sizes vary. I wear an 11 in Nike, bought a size 11, and these fit perfect. For those with wider feet, the toes are a little tight at first, but they loosen up after a day or so of wearing them and they’re really comfortable after that.",5,1,8
"My last Air Nike shoes which I had purchased, fell apart within two days of use. Well, the bubbles on the bottom popped and then afterwards, the soles detached. So I was a little worried about these shoes and put them to even heavier use than the previous ones to see what would happen, and they stood up to the wear and tear. They were initially a little tight at first, but after some use, they fit my feet just fine and did not fall apart at all. I'm glad to wear these comfortable shoes for the long-term future.",5,1,8
"I’d bought the model after this and enjoyed them until they had holes in the mesh. I went to the store to find out that they had newer models so I purchased them thinking they would fit just as good. But they didn’t, this model provides the classic arch support while also having a stylish Nike logo.

The only downside is that you might have trouble fitting in your true size, order a half size up if you have big toes. Also look for a possible defect on the inside of the shoe near the tip to make sure it doesn’t bruise.

Overall a 9/10.",5,1,8
Feel and look great to me. Wife already milked me cause of them That's an opinion and others may dislike them but to give them a garbage review cause your fat hooves don't fit is scary dumb.,5,1,8
Falling apart at the seams Literally,1,0,8
I was worried that these would be knockoff fake nikes. However I already have a pair of these and I compared every aspect of them. If they are fakes then they used every material and stitch that nike uses. These look legit. My last pair has lasted me a year and a half and are still going strong. I bought these because I know how they fit already and because the new nike designs aren’t my style.,5,1,8
"Been a Nike fan for years and now that I'm able to get a decent pair that catch my attention, I had to have these! My mom bought me the Nike Air Max Torch 4 Blues for my birthday a couple of years ago and I love them! Saw the Torch 3's and it was a must have for me. Fit comfortable and look great!",5,1,8
Someone else made a comment about how narrow the shoes are but I disregarded it because I don’t have clodhoppers. I probably should’ve listened but they’re comfortable enough.,3,0,8
I love the Torch the first day was tight once I broke them in they are perfect. Feel real good walking around in them especially the type of job I do.. I have no dislike. Love the tie box width and especially the arch support…,5,1,8
"1st experience with NIKE
Loved the color & how it looked!
Not sure if Original or not, as detailing & materials are a bit undergraded
Size was a bit tight, as I used to wear Adidas 11.5, that is not available on NIKE (at least on Amazon). But am sure they will be ok very soon
Durability, will comment on it after a while since I've had em, lol",3,0,8
Fourth pair of air max sneakers in about 6 years. Sizing has been consistent and these are no different. Liking them after a week of solid use.,5,1,8
"It’s a poor design. Don’t buy it. I am getting pain in the ankle. I had been getting the pain since the day 1. I thought it’s my ankle and I checked with orthopedic and he confirmed that’s it due to poor alignment of the feet during running or walking. So, I switched to another shoe and I have issues. Now I can’t return it. @Amazon could you do something about it?",1,0,8
I loved very good service and a good product,5,1,8
The quality of the shoe was terrible I would never buy it again not even for $20 it also looked like it was worn and resold which is against the law,1,0,8
"My husband has commented at least five times,that he loves these sneakers as being the most comfortable he'd ever had. He said the heel is so cushioned when you step. A+",5,1,8
"I've never spent much money on shoes but my new job is so hard on my feet I figured it's worth a try and ya know what I don't mind work now. Comfy, Solid and Easy on the wide toes",5,1,8
Weird fabric. Black sides of shoe get scuffed easily. Makes shoe look old quickly. And it’s thick/clunky looking. The back side it’s nice the from and top look like clunky cheap shoes.,2,0,8
"First time wearing them out after ten minutes I had to take them off.
Shoe fits hard. Toe box smaller than depicted. A new shoe is supposed to be somewhat of a relief, a relief which I never got .",1,0,8
"I'm a huge airmax fan and these fit great, look great you can't go wrong for the price. They feel and look just as nice as the airmax I've paid over $200 for this is my 15th pair of airmax shoes big big fan of the airmax!",5,1,8
"Perfecto lo recomiendo al 100 % una aclaración siempre pidan medio número más
Pero buen material y duradero",5,1,8
"The shoes themselves are very good. The sizes are awful (hence the 3 stars). I checked the size to another nike shoes that I had and fit right, so I ordered that size. It did not fit at all, so I had to return the first one and go 2 sizes bigger. Even after that, they are a bit tight. It is really hard to figure out which to order.
These have a thicker build to them, and the sizing seemed to be measured on the outside. So the inside of the shoe is smaller and won't fit right.
If the shoe fits though, it's comfortable and looks nice, so I don't feel like I wasted my money.",3,0,8
Well this shoe is one of my favorite to (walk) around with.I would NOT recomend this shoe for running not even 1 mile.Better stick with a asics.I tried running on these shoes and by mile 2 my feet HURT.on my ASICS I can go 5 miles no problems.BUT this shoe is very nice looking and I can (walk )all day on them,4,1,8
I bought these for my son. They look great and he tells me they fit well. He runs frequently and needs quality shoes.,5,1,8
"I run about 6 to 10 miles per week in one or two runs, so average 4 to 8 miles per run. I tried NIKE’s minimalist shoe and, while great for walks and shorter runs, I need the arch support that this model provides. As a running buddy put it, I have a “NIKE foot.”",5,1,8
"Estan super 👍🏻👍🏻!! Muy padres muy satisfecho con estos tenis, super comodos ! Recomendados!! Solo la caja en la que son enviados tambn viene dañada, como en otros tenis que ya habia encargado, pero fuera de eso los tenis llegaron en buen estado. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",5,1,8
Bought mine at famous footwear couple years ago..i take care of my stuff (ex. Clean after each wear) got a tennis shoe fetis..and still look brand new 79$,5,1,8
"These shoes fit great and little snug in the toe box but with the right socks, feels awesome!!!!",5,1,8
"Calidad y diseño de acuerdo a los estándares, precio Justo
Recomendado",5,1,8
My husband loves this shoe! He has very flat and wide feet. He has Never talked about a shoe like this before!! This is the second pair for him! Loves them. They also have held up very well. I always water proof our shoes when we get them to increase their lifespan!,5,1,8
"This sneaker was fine but overall it felt heavy and chunky. If you like that feeling then that's fine but with all the really good sneakers out there with tough and lightweight materials, this one feels heavy. I just replaced them with a pair of ""On-Cloud's"" and its like night and day.",3,0,8
"tengo un Nike Vomero10 de tañaño US 11,5 y lo tomé como referencia para pedir éste en la misma medida. Me quedó chico y no me fue posible usarlo. Es vital una mayor información y mayor presición de talles y medidas reales por cada modelo.",1,0,8
Fantastic running shoe. It fits really well and looks fantastic! Great quality.,5,1,8
"The shoe is made of highly durable materials but is very narrow. So I returned it right after trying it on. The arch support is there, in my opinion but my toes got squished and the side of my feet hurt just putting them on.",3,0,8
Don’t buy if you have a narrow foot. The front is very tight. I bought my usual Nike size but this was too uncomfortable. The shoes look great and are well padded though some of the seams looked slightly frayed. Amazon accepted the return without any trouble.,3,0,8
I was shopping for running shoes disappointed,2,0,8
"They came in excellent condition, fit to size, no toe tag as some reviews say. I love the support and feel. Great buy, will buy from this seller again!",5,1,8
Nice shoe but if you have wide feet you need to order two sizes larger,4,1,8
"Real Nike sneakers are not made in Venezuela!! All Amazon sneakers are from whatever company are knockoffs!!
Never again for any sort of footwear",1,0,8
It's a good fitting shoe. Just as expected from the brand,5,1,8
"Very nice! Super comfortable! I had a great experience with this seller, super quick delivery. They came 4 days early.",5,1,8
Great shows. I take out the insoles these Nike shoes come with and put in New Balance insoles so I cannot answer the arch support as the shoes come. With the New Balance insoles arch support is great,5,1,8
Purchased for going on long walk with the dogs. Very comfortable over all.,5,1,8
I got the package delivered today. Once I opened it the shoe looks like its worn. Underneath the shoe was dirty. I am not satisfied. I will return and reorder it. It was my husband's birthday gift. I am not happy with the product or where its shipped from.,5,1,8
I found a shoe that supports my frame properly. That should be easy you would think but I have tried some other brand shoes like sketcher and Merrell which are good shoes but they make my feet and joints hurt by the end of the day,5,1,8
"A little tight for the first few times of wearing, but after breaking them in, their really a comfortable shoe. Had mine for about a year now and they still look and fit great. No holes or tears.",5,1,8
"Great shoes and quick delivery. When you order these shoes, make sure that the shoe size is correct in the order cart. The size in the order cart is the one that you will receive. The shoes that I received were exactly what I wanted.",5,1,8
Love them I walk a lot and these shoes are so comfortable.,5,1,8
The width of the sneaker is narrower/tighter than I expected. Other than that I love the feel when you walk on it and I love the look.,5,1,8
Product came with ok packaging. Size was true-to-fit. Good style of sneaker. Firm and supportive support.,5,1,8
Nice shoes. They are very comfortable and fit as expected. I would purchase these again.,5,1,8
Nice looking shoes. Except one was defeated. And too tight for me.. had to reorder larger once’s,3,0,8
Just didn’t fit me. Can be a great shoe for someone with smaller feet,1,0,8
My husband loves them. He is extremely picky so this was a good buy!,5,1,8
"The chart was set up for a EE wide foot and matched with this shoe. The shoe isn’t a wide with, other than that I liked the shoe. Barring the front of my foot being squeezed to the point of discomfort.",1,0,8
the shoes were extremly tight width wise. This particular shoe model was a big disappointment in all aspects. I would strongly recommend not purchasing it.,1,0,8
Shoes hurt my feet after about 20 mins of wear. The arch support feels stiff which cramps and and irritates your feet. Waste of money. Looks elsewhere,2,0,8
"This is a very good shoe. I don't run in them but they are great fitting shoe and feel really good on. I love the style. I'm a 9 1/2 so that's what I ordered, they fit perfectly.",5,1,8
I had some trepidation ordering shoes without trying them on but they fit perfectly.,5,1,8
I stand for 12 hours a day at work and have a hard time finding a decent shoe to not cramp my feet. These definitely have no issue with support. I would recommend to anyone!,5,1,8
Shoes fit well and is my second pair of these type. They are not as wide as I might need but I like how they fit and lace up. As good traction as well.,4,1,8
love them and I am a female who is on her feet numerous hours a day,5,1,8

"These are some very nice shoes, they fit as expected and didn’t let me down.",5,1,8

"I have been buying the Nike downshifters for years and have loved them. They are cushioned and flexible and great for my sensitive feet. I decided to try the tourch 3, and have had issues with feet from the start. They provide cushion, but they are not flexible. Obviously everyone’s feet are different, but if you buy these and they don’t feel quite right, ditch them immediately or make sure you get your ice packs ready.",1,0,8
At first I thought the shoe was defective ; there was something along the inside of the shoe el that was etching my toe; I fix it .,4,1,8

Cant be a real nike shoe. I have nike shoes from years ago that didnt wear out as fast as these shoes did. The inside sole is almost worn out and the structure of the shoes is showing. I would recommend or purchase again.,2,0,8

"Length and width are as expected for Nike, but fit is unusually tight on the topside of the foot where the shoe's tongue starts, and the laces widen towards the top. Seller says it can't be stretched to fit, but has offered to refund or replace if not worn outside. It's possible that these shoes will break in with use, but it would be a painful process.",2,0,8

Luce excelente. De longitud es justo la medida que dice ser. En cuanto al anchura es un poco justo. Recomendaría pedir medio número más para que sea perfecto.,5,1,8
Shoes are irregular. One shoe is cut different from the other. Now I see why I never buy clothes and shoes online. I took a chance and not to satisfied.,2,0,8

Very comfortable shoe ordered the same size like I’ve worn for years but it was one size too small order one size bigger fit great.,5,1,8
Muy buen articulo,5,1,8
I played basketball in these shoes and my shins were tight and super sore no more than an hour after I stopped. They don't seem to have a very soft sole.,2,0,8
This shoe is very comfortable i love them and only gave them a four star in comparison to other Air max shoes I’ve had but still an awesome buy! Thanks,4,1,8

It is really fit and my husband really loves it,5,1,8
Shoes fit perfectly,5,1,8
Great shoes fast shipping,5,1,8
Great pair of shoes. I have had them for some time now and I love them. I can't seem to find these in the stores at all so definitely a good find on Amazon.,5,1,8
Shoes are poor quality. I have worn them approximately 10 times and the front of the shoe has frayed and the white Nike symbol had fallen off.,1,0,8
"The Air Max Torch 3 is the Hummer of athletic shoes: it looks large and imposing on the outside, but is tiny and cramped on the inside. I don't know how shoes that look this wide could be so narrow on the inside. The toe box is also tight, and the length of the shoes runs one-half to a full size too small. The shoes I was sent appeared to have used, or at least taken out of the box, before--the shoe box looked like it had been mauled by a cat, see attached picture. Unless you are looking for used shoes that are chunky and painful to wear, look elsewhere. I will try to wear them, but only because I wasted 90 dollars on them.",2,0,8
I have been wearing this shoe for last six months and liked the shoe and decided to order another pair. I believe these are all defect shoes on Amazon for this brand and style. There is a nub that sticks out inside the shoe. It is right next to your big toe and it is EXTREMELY irritating. I ordered the shoe and had the issue then reordered it again and was surprised to see the exact same issue on the next pair. I returned both without any issues.,1,0,8
"These run about 1/2 size small. I wear a women's 9.5-10, and a men's 8.5. The 8.5 is too small. Not sure who says they run true to size, they must like their shoes right up against their toes!! I reordered a 9. If they are good, I will update my review!",4,1,8
Tried them on and walked around the living room. Very stiff and uncomfortable. Knew they weren’t for me. Ended up going to a local DSW and trying on a pair of ASICS that felt comfortable immediately so I got those . I liked the look of the Nikes better but I had to go for comfort because that is the main deal Right? ...Not what some celebrity wears . I have What would be considered a small narrow foot and they were still too tight and cramped feeling.,2,0,8
"I don't really know what it is, but Nike shoes always fit me best. When I originally found the Air Max Torch shoes I really felt like they fit me better than any shoe. They are actually energizing in how they fit so well and how lightweight they are. I am probably on my 5th or 6th pair of Torch 3s and have also invested in a set of Torch 4s because I like them so much!",5,1,8
"Ordered a second pair. I have narrow feet and these fit perfectly. They are true to my size (12D) and although not super padding like some of my Brooks and Hokas, these fit so well that my feet are happier during and after each run. They are the best shoes I have worn in a long time. Wish Nike would keep the 3s around. I will order one more pair before you can't buy them any longer.",5,1,8
"Mine showed up in two days, brand new and never worn. I see a lot of reviews regarding size issues. Get whatever size you wear in Nike shoes and they’ll fit fine. Seems every shoe company’s sizes vary. I wear an 11 in Nike, bought a size 11, and these fit perfect. For those with wider feet, the toes are a little tight at first, but they loosen up after a day or so of wearing them and they’re really comfortable after that.",5,1,8
"My last Air Nike shoes which I had purchased, fell apart within two days of use. Well, the bubbles on the bottom popped and then afterwards, the soles detached. So I was a little worried about these shoes and put them to even heavier use than the previous ones to see what would happen, and they stood up to the wear and tear. They were initially a little tight at first, but after some use, they fit my feet just fine and did not fall apart at all. I'm glad to wear these comfortable shoes for the long-term future.",5,1,8
"I’d bought the model after this and enjoyed them until they had holes in the mesh. I went to the store to find out that they had newer models so I purchased them thinking they would fit just as good. But they didn’t, this model provides the classic arch support while also having a stylish Nike logo.

The only downside is that you might have trouble fitting in your true size, order a half size up if you have big toes. Also look for a possible defect on the inside of the shoe near the tip to make sure it doesn’t bruise.

Overall a 9/10.",5,1,8
Feel and look great to me. Wife already milked me cause of them That's an opinion and others may dislike them but to give them a garbage review cause your fat hooves don't fit is scary dumb.,5,1,8
Falling apart at the seams Literally,1,0,8
I was worried that these would be knockoff fake nikes. However I already have a pair of these and I compared every aspect of them. If they are fakes then they used every material and stitch that nike uses. These look legit. My last pair has lasted me a year and a half and are still going strong. I bought these because I know how they fit already and because the new nike designs aren’t my style.,5,1,8
"Been a Nike fan for years and now that I'm able to get a decent pair that catch my attention, I had to have these! My mom bought me the Nike Air Max Torch 4 Blues for my birthday a couple of years ago and I love them! Saw the Torch 3's and it was a must have for me. Fit comfortable and look great!",5,1,8
Someone else made a comment about how narrow the shoes are but I disregarded it because I don’t have clodhoppers. I probably should’ve listened but they’re comfortable enough.,3,0,8
I love the Torch the first day was tight once I broke them in they are perfect. Feel real good walking around in them especially the type of job I do.. I have no dislike. Love the tie box width and especially the arch support…,5,1,8
"1st experience with NIKE
Loved the color & how it looked!
Not sure if Original or not, as detailing & materials are a bit undergraded
Size was a bit tight, as I used to wear Adidas 11.5, that is not available on NIKE (at least on Amazon). But am sure they will be ok very soon
Durability, will comment on it after a while since I've had em, lol",3,0,8
Fourth pair of air max sneakers in about 6 years. Sizing has been consistent and these are no different. Liking them after a week of solid use.,5,1,8
"It’s a poor design. Don’t buy it. I am getting pain in the ankle. I had been getting the pain since the day 1. I thought it’s my ankle and I checked with orthopedic and he confirmed that’s it due to poor alignment of the feet during running or walking. So, I switched to another shoe and I have issues. Now I can’t return it. @Amazon could you do something about it?",1,0,8
I loved very good service and a good product,5,1,8
The quality of the shoe was terrible I would never buy it again not even for $20 it also looked like it was worn and resold which is against the law,1,0,8
"My husband has commented at least five times,that he loves these sneakers as being the most comfortable he'd ever had. He said the heel is so cushioned when you step. A+",5,1,8
"I've never spent much money on shoes but my new job is so hard on my feet I figured it's worth a try and ya know what I don't mind work now. Comfy, Solid and Easy on the wide toes",5,1,8
Weird fabric. Black sides of shoe get scuffed easily. Makes shoe look old quickly. And it’s thick/clunky looking. The back side it’s nice the from and top look like clunky cheap shoes.,2,0,8
"First time wearing them out after ten minutes I had to take them off.
Shoe fits hard. Toe box smaller than depicted. A new shoe is supposed to be somewhat of a relief, a relief which I never got .",1,0,8
"I'm a huge airmax fan and these fit great, look great you can't go wrong for the price. They feel and look just as nice as the airmax I've paid over $200 for this is my 15th pair of airmax shoes big big fan of the airmax!",5,1,8
"Perfecto lo recomiendo al 100 % una aclaración siempre pidan medio número más
Pero buen material y duradero",5,1,8
"The shoes themselves are very good. The sizes are awful (hence the 3 stars). I checked the size to another nike shoes that I had and fit right, so I ordered that size. It did not fit at all, so I had to return the first one and go 2 sizes bigger. Even after that, they are a bit tight. It is really hard to figure out which to order.
These have a thicker build to them, and the sizing seemed to be measured on the outside. So the inside of the shoe is smaller and won't fit right.
If the shoe fits though, it's comfortable and looks nice, so I don't feel like I wasted my money.",3,0,8
Well this shoe is one of my favorite to (walk) around with.I would NOT recomend this shoe for running not even 1 mile.Better stick with a asics.I tried running on these shoes and by mile 2 my feet HURT.on my ASICS I can go 5 miles no problems.BUT this shoe is very nice looking and I can (walk )all day on them,4,1,8
I bought these for my son. They look great and he tells me they fit well. He runs frequently and needs quality shoes.,5,1,8
"I run about 6 to 10 miles per week in one or two runs, so average 4 to 8 miles per run. I tried NIKE’s minimalist shoe and, while great for walks and shorter runs, I need the arch support that this model provides. As a running buddy put it, I have a “NIKE foot.”",5,1,8
"Estan super 👍🏻👍🏻!! Muy padres muy satisfecho con estos tenis, super comodos ! Recomendados!! Solo la caja en la que son enviados tambn viene dañada, como en otros tenis que ya habia encargado, pero fuera de eso los tenis llegaron en buen estado. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",5,1,8
Bought mine at famous footwear couple years ago..i take care of my stuff (ex. Clean after each wear) got a tennis shoe fetis..and still look brand new 79$,5,1,8
"These shoes fit great and little snug in the toe box but with the right socks, feels awesome!!!!",5,1,8
"Calidad y diseño de acuerdo a los estándares, precio Justo
Recomendado",5,1,8
My husband loves this shoe! He has very flat and wide feet. He has Never talked about a shoe like this before!! This is the second pair for him! Loves them. They also have held up very well. I always water proof our shoes when we get them to increase their lifespan!,5,1,8
"This sneaker was fine but overall it felt heavy and chunky. If you like that feeling then that's fine but with all the really good sneakers out there with tough and lightweight materials, this one feels heavy. I just replaced them with a pair of ""On-Cloud's"" and its like night and day.",3,0,8
"tengo un Nike Vomero10 de tañaño US 11,5 y lo tomé como referencia para pedir éste en la misma medida. Me quedó chico y no me fue posible usarlo. Es vital una mayor información y mayor presición de talles y medidas reales por cada modelo.",1,0,8
Fantastic running shoe. It fits really well and looks fantastic! Great quality.,5,1,8
"The shoe is made of highly durable materials but is very narrow. So I returned it right after trying it on. The arch support is there, in my opinion but my toes got squished and the side of my feet hurt just putting them on.",3,0,8
Don’t buy if you have a narrow foot. The front is very tight. I bought my usual Nike size but this was too uncomfortable. The shoes look great and are well padded though some of the seams looked slightly frayed. Amazon accepted the return without any trouble.,3,0,8
I was shopping for running shoes disappointed,2,0,8
"They came in excellent condition, fit to size, no toe tag as some reviews say. I love the support and feel. Great buy, will buy from this seller again!",5,1,8
Nice shoe but if you have wide feet you need to order two sizes larger,4,1,8
"Real Nike sneakers are not made in Venezuela!! All Amazon sneakers are from whatever company are knockoffs!!
Never again for any sort of footwear",1,0,8
It's a good fitting shoe. Just as expected from the brand,5,1,8
"Very nice! Super comfortable! I had a great experience with this seller, super quick delivery. They came 4 days early.",5,1,8
Great shows. I take out the insoles these Nike shoes come with and put in New Balance insoles so I cannot answer the arch support as the shoes come. With the New Balance insoles arch support is great,5,1,8
Purchased for going on long walk with the dogs. Very comfortable over all.,5,1,8
I got the package delivered today. Once I opened it the shoe looks like its worn. Underneath the shoe was dirty. I am not satisfied. I will return and reorder it. It was my husband's birthday gift. I am not happy with the product or where its shipped from.,5,1,8
I found a shoe that supports my frame properly. That should be easy you would think but I have tried some other brand shoes like sketcher and Merrell which are good shoes but they make my feet and joints hurt by the end of the day,5,1,8
"A little tight for the first few times of wearing, but after breaking them in, their really a comfortable shoe. Had mine for about a year now and they still look and fit great. No holes or tears.",5,1,8
"Great shoes and quick delivery. When you order these shoes, make sure that the shoe size is correct in the order cart. The size in the order cart is the one that you will receive. The shoes that I received were exactly what I wanted.",5,1,8
Love them I walk a lot and these shoes are so comfortable.,5,1,8
The width of the sneaker is narrower/tighter than I expected. Other than that I love the feel when you walk on it and I love the look.,5,1,8
Product came with ok packaging. Size was true-to-fit. Good style of sneaker. Firm and supportive support.,5,1,8
Nice shoes. They are very comfortable and fit as expected. I would purchase these again.,5,1,8
Nice looking shoes. Except one was defeated. And too tight for me.. had to reorder larger once’s,3,0,8
Just didn’t fit me. Can be a great shoe for someone with smaller feet,1,0,8
My husband loves them. He is extremely picky so this was a good buy!,5,1,8
"The chart was set up for a EE wide foot and matched with this shoe. The shoe isn’t a wide with, other than that I liked the shoe. Barring the front of my foot being squeezed to the point of discomfort.",1,0,8
the shoes were extremly tight width wise. This particular shoe model was a big disappointment in all aspects. I would strongly recommend not purchasing it.,1,0,8
Shoes hurt my feet after about 20 mins of wear. The arch support feels stiff which cramps and and irritates your feet. Waste of money. Looks elsewhere,2,0,8
"This is a very good shoe. I don't run in them but they are great fitting shoe and feel really good on. I love the style. I'm a 9 1/2 so that's what I ordered, they fit perfectly.",5,1,8
I had some trepidation ordering shoes without trying them on but they fit perfectly.,5,1,8
I stand for 12 hours a day at work and have a hard time finding a decent shoe to not cramp my feet. These definitely have no issue with support. I would recommend to anyone!,5,1,8
Shoes fit well and is my second pair of these type. They are not as wide as I might need but I like how they fit and lace up. As good traction as well.,4,1,8
love them and I am a female who is on her feet numerous hours a day,5,1,8
shoe is good. just had to break in some,5,1,8
"On Nike shoes I am always side 12, I ordered this product with peace of mind but some how it will not fit right. They are too tight.",1,0,8

It’s a shoe. I liked it,5,1,8
I bought them for my brother-in-law. They fit well and have great support. He wears them to school almost everyday and they are still in great shape!,4,1,8
"Very nice shoes, fit pretty decent.",5,1,8
"Out of the box the shoes looked great, but once on my feet, the truth was painfully clear. The sneaker was too narrow for my foot, and I wasn't going to force it. I'm so disappointed!",3,0,8
Returned not happy,1,0,8
"I bought these for my husband, he loves them",5,1,8
Not even a week old. Stitching came out of the side! Very unhappy!!!!,1,0,8
WORK,5,1,8
This product is very uncomfortable to wear. It has defective sewing at the toes and makes blisters on your feet. Only wore them twice and now they sit in my closet,1,0,8
"These are some very nice shoes, they fit as expected and didn’t let me down.",5,1,8
Not sure how to describe this but the shoe is very tight on you even when we exchanged for right size so be careful buying,1,0,8
Works well and fit is perfect.,5,1,8
"There seems to be a defective plastic piece that sticks out and rubs on the large toe. I would rate higher if not for this because it's not comfortable, however I've figured out a way to improvise the shoe.",3,0,8
So small and bubble was low on air,1,0,8
ver good,5,1,8
excellente y muy practico,5,1,8
Great quality shoe. Fit is a size smaller than what you would expect. I normally wear a 11-1/2 and bound texaclt that. The show shows up feeling like a 10-1/2.,4,1,8
Normally my husband wears a 10.5 I got him a size 11. Way to to tight. Nice looking but to narrow. Had to return. Nice shipping,3,0,8
"I've used these shoes for a few years, ordered several pair. I order them oversized so air flows in and out of the shoe, they are stable, mesh top so it can flex comfortably with exercise. Highly recommend.",5,1,8
Looks good and comfortable,5,1,8
Good looking comfortable shoe,5,1,8
My husband loves these shoes. He is normally a 12.5 and I read the shoes run snug so we got a 13 fit comfortably for someone that has wide feet GO UP A SIZE.other than that the shoes a great buy 👍🏼,5,1,8
 I like them. Just went for run 3 mile and they were Amazing.,5,1,8
"I have been buying the Nike downshifters for years and have loved them. They are cushioned and flexible and great for my sensitive feet. I decided to try the tourch 3, and have had issues with feet from the start. They provide cushion, but they are not flexible. Obviously everyone’s feet are different, but if you buy these and they don’t feel quite right, ditch them immediately or make sure you get your ice packs ready.",1,0,8
At first I thought the shoe was defective ; there was something along the inside of the shoe el that was etching my toe; I fix it .,4,1,8
This is my fourth pair and as long as it is available will continue to buy.,5,1,8
I love this shoe. Very comfortable. I paid more than I wanted to but after wearing them I realize you get what you pay for. Very happy. I’m a Nike shoe guy,5,1,8
Great looking shoes - I've had several negative experiences with Nike soles falling apart after walking in the rain but no need to knock these ones over it. Look really nice,5,1,8
Great product,5,1,8
Cant be a real nike shoe. I have nike shoes from years ago that didnt wear out as fast as these shoes did. The inside sole is almost worn out and the structure of the shoes is showing. I would recommend or purchase again.,2,0,8
It fits very snug and because of that it doesn’t have much breathing room compared to other size 11 Nike sneakers I purchased before.,4,1,8
thanks,5,1,8
Really fits well and have been running in them for months. Very good run and support.,5,1,8
Great product worth money,5,1,8

I dont know was present for my son,5,1,8
"Length and width are as expected for Nike, but fit is unusually tight on the topside of the foot where the shoe's tongue starts, and the laces widen towards the top. Seller says it can't be stretched to fit, but has offered to refund or replace if not worn outside. It's possible that these shoes will break in with use, but it would be a painful process.",2,0,8

"Most un American junk I’ve ever purchased! Don’t forget, while nike doesn’t support “oppression” in the U.S., they’ll gladly pay a child in China or Southeast Asia, pennies an hour to make their shoes. Hypocrisy at its finest.",1,0,8

Great shoes fast shipping,5,1,8
Although none of my friends asked if I was fast when they saw them they did say I looked cool (may have just been because of the new bracelet my sister made me). My wife said I can’t wear them to work or church she did say I could wear them as long as it’s not muddy out and I’m really pumped about that!,5,1,8
Just what he wanted.,5,1,8
"Bad material, doesn’t look like the photo. For a $80 shoe even a $40 shoe would be better than this one.",1,0,8
"I have worn these shoes maybe a total of 10 times to break them in. I never even got a chance to run in them before they fell apart.

"Not the most comfortable shoes I own, but they look great and are holding up well.",5,1,8
Narrow shoe and runs longer than other Nikes.,3,0,8
Just the worst shoes. Within weeks the bottom tread was smooth as the asphalt beneath a 48th story window in a Guangzong Nike Factory. Hope you don't have to walk in the rain in these shoes (heaven forbid run). You will be slipping and sliding all over the place. I honestly don't know how these are Nikes.,1,0,8
Tight on the sides if you're flat-footed.,4,1,8
Bought these in place of Nike's Nike renewal since they don't make the original style anymore and these are nowhere near as comfortable,2,0,8
There is a white spot won’t come off really sad.,1,0,8
