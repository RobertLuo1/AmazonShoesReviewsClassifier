I ordered these in my normal shoe size but they ran much too large.,1,0,14.0
"VERY frustrating that after less than 5 months of extremely light wear, one of the straps broke and the shoe is now useless. We have been on distance learning since the pandemic began so we rarely leave the house. My son has BARELY worn these shoes and they are now useless to us. I cannot afford to replace my son's shoes every 5 months! Buying these was a huge mistake and a big disappointment.",1,0,14.0
"I tried these in a local shoe store and felt great in the 5min or so of trying them on there but couldn't get my size AND a decent color from them

1: I picked these because of the very soft/cushioned outer sole and insole, but the cushion seemed to have deflated / compacted after roughly only a month

2: the fake shoe laces (just a giant loop) don't have any way to lock them down even if you pull them tight
this means the foot moves inside the shoe and can cause blisters",2,0,14.0
"Its a great looking shoe. I saw it in the store and specifically looked for this shoe online because we liked it so much.
Bought it for my 12 yr old. SO disappointed in the quality though! Very thin fabric - that makes it breathable, but also means toes pop through in no time. The fabric is peeling away from the sole after less than a month of wear. If Im going to spend that much on a shoe, I will buy a brand that holds up better next time.",2,0,14.0
"They said size 10 US, but were 11. I have a lot of sneakers/shoes from many different brands and the size is always consistent. When I returned them at Kohls/Amazon drop off, I bought the same exact same pair in a 10 and they fit perfect. When applying for the return on Amazon, I noticed someone else had also commented they were a size too large. I'd recommend picking them up somewhere else to be safe and avoid having to return them.",1,0,14.0
"I ordered these for my son to have new school shoes. They lasted a mere 8 DAYS before the loops ripped out and now they are in-wearable! Total junk shoes DO NOT BUY. My son has a broken shoulder right now and cannot participate in gym class or recess so these were used for nothing more than walking within the school building. Adidas should be ashamed. Now - because they were purchased on Amazon and not my local retailer, returns will be extremely difficult if not impossible. What a waste.

Additionally- note that these are a very wide fitting shoe and run big overall. If you have a narrow foot beware - that is - if the thought of paying $65 for shoes that will be unwearable in a couple days doesn’t deter you from buying them in the first place.",1,0,14.0
"Came with silver painted numbers on the front toe where everyone can see them. Also not connected together and just sent loose in a bag and not a adidas box. Even after reading good reviews, I’m questioning if these are real adidas sneakers. I’ve seen $10 sneakers with better quality",1,0,14.0
"Received the pair in a beaten box. The paper inside each shoe looked re-wadded. I suspect I was given a used pair, which would explain why the lacing was all messed up on one of the shoes.

Disappointed that Amazon would even consider sending me this. I've owned a pair before and they were good, so I'll have to update my review if they can send me a working pair.",1,0,14.0
I bought a size 12 for my teenage son to use for running during his JROTC Raiders program. Buyer beware these are a slide on shoe and the shoelaces are just for looks. There is no way to tighten them. My son is very thin and has thin ankles and the shoe would fall off of his foot when he tried to even walk in them. I ended up having to cut those shoelaces off and that was very difficult because they were stitched into the bottom loop on the toe of the shoe. I had to pull it apart with tweezers which took me darn near an hour and then I had to go out and buy extra long shoelaces to then lace up the shoe and tie it tightly. If you are actually wearing these for walking or running I don't recommend buying them unless you want to have to do what I did. Otherwise they are a great looking shoe well made and very lightweight. But why would you sell a running shoe that cannot be adjusted for tightness. This was definitely fashion over function.,3,0,14.0
"Hole within the sneaker on toe. Will need replacement ASAP. If not will get credit from amazon prime member if not replaced prime as issues credit next day. Just got my credit
Horrible product worst customer service. Do I have say anymore.",1,0,14.0
"I bought these for my husband as a birthday gift. They look great on him, but he says they feel loose and his feet slide around in the shoe. I ordered his usual size he wears in adidas shoes. My family basically only wears adidas shoes because they are quality made and durable. I have 3 sons who go through shoes fairly quickly, but adidas holds up much longer.",3,0,14.0
"Perfect fit except for my heel, kept popping up and rubbing and ended up getting a blister. They squeak like crazy too, my coworkers started calling me squidward with the way my footsteps sound. Some of the loops that hold the laces popped out. Lacing system was... interesting. I love adidas sneakers but these were disappointing.",3,0,14.0
Ordered my husband a pair because he already has some and these are way too big he is an 11 ordered an 11 and too bigike two socks needed too big. May need to order a size down to keep away from the return process.,3,0,14.0
"These shoes fit great, very comfortable. I was looking for a lightweight shoes to take a daily 3 mile walk in the neighborhood. The issue I had is after a week the soles wore out. I thought it was just a defect so I returned the shoes and ordered a new pair. The same thing happened on the second pair and I had to return them as well.",2,0,14.0
"I really wanted to give these a better rating because of the support/comfort, but since the laces can’t be tightened my son can’t run (play basketball, certain exercises) or they about come off his feet. Unfortunately they aren’t as snug as they need to be to stay on. That’s really the only bad thing I can say about them, but for him that’s a pretty big problem.",3,0,14.0
I was so excited because of getting older and less flexible to find a sneaker that was slip-on and reasonably priced. The problem is these are not as easy to slip on as I was hoping. I still require 2 hands and have to bend low and struggle to get over my heel. My budget doesn't allow me to try some of the other brands.,3,0,14.0
My son liked that they were comfortable. Two days into him wearing them to school the little loops that holds the lace started to detach from the sneakers. Adidas? When did the quality go down? I don't think I will buy this brand again. Very disappointed. They are his only sneakers right now so how can I return them.,1,0,14.0
These shoes got dirty so fast !!! I mean right away! And then I just noticed the price dropped over $20 since I purchased them a few weeks ago! Do not buy these shoes if they are over $ 45 - which is what the price is now - I paid $65 and every piece of dirt sticks to them !! Do not purchase !unless you like dirty white shoes.,2,0,14.0
"You can't adjust these laces. I guess they are supposed to magically fit. For my son, the length of the sole was perfect, but the shoe expects a foot with much more volume, so it was just loose. THERE IS NO WAY TO ADJUST THE LACES. You can either take your chances and order or tell Adidas this is nonsense and don't buy them.",2,0,14.0
"After wearing the shoes a dozen times or so over a 4 month period - they’ve never even been washed - one of the “laces” pulled out. Amazon’s return window closes after 30 days, and I haven’t reached out to Adidas yet... disappointed.",1,0,14.0
"These shoes were
bought on 28 Mar 2021
and
delivered on 30 Mar 2021.

In less than
Sixty days of normal walking,
they Look like This.

Both the Left and Right shoe are tearing at the seams.

I Could never in good conscience recommend this shoe.",1,0,14.0
"I bought this because it is supposed to have cloud foam in it. My other shoes with cloudfoam feel like pillows on your feet, super comfortable. This pair had a very firm sole and it not comfortable at all. Also it does not have adjustable shoe laces so you are suck with what they give you.",2,0,14.0
"This shoe was great for the few months that the tread existed. I don't know if they used a softer material or something relative to other shoes, but its already developed several smooth spots on the sole. This has caused me to slip in damp conditions (after a very light rain).

They're probably great if you don't use them a lot, or only use them lightly. I run, lift, and go for long walks on unpaved trails, and that use tore smoothed them out pretty quick. Very easy to get on and off though!",3,0,14.0
"Color descriptions and pictures do not match up. I selected black shoes with a white sole (based on the pictures). I got the right shoe style, but the wrong color. The shoes I received were all black, including the soles. Super annoying, these are a gift so I will see if they are ok with this color otherwise I will return.",2,0,14.0
Completely wrong color shoes. Ordered all black. Recieved black white and green. Shoes fit about a size larger than what they're stated too even though it claims true to size.,1,0,14.0
"These looked great and fit great for a short time, however the soles aren’t durable. My son has worn them to walk sparingly over the last few weeks, and has run in them 3 times. Just 3! These seem more suited for someone who isn’t active, which is opposite to how they’re marketed.",3,0,14.0
They are cheaply made. The side of shoe split from sole within 30 days of purchase. Ordered a replacement pair think that first pair were a lemon. Second pair broke at same spot on new shoe within 20 days of receiving them. Save your money and buy something different.,1,0,14.0
"These shoes were purchased for my 14yr old son for tennis. He liked them because they were lightweight and comfortable. However, after 4 weeks of only being worn to tennis practice and matches, these shoes fell apart! Not what we would expect from Adidas.",1,0,14.0
"I was looking for a laceless running shoe and tried this since it was cheap. The shoe is comfortable but too loose on my narrow feet (I wear thirteens, cue Biggie). I feel like my feet may slip out during running on the treadmill. The outsole has also worn down significantly after one single 5k run on the treadmill. These may become gym shoes or house slippers :(",2,0,14.0
Got these for my 10yr old and the mesh had ripped within a week just with normal play. These shoes are good for walking but not any type of normal 10 year old playing.,3,0,14.0
"I ordered this shoe, and had to have it immediately replaced due to a broken shoelace. The shoe is very spongy and offers little in the way of support. I'd say it is OK for the gym only, not for long walks.",3,0,14.0
"These are nice for what I bought them for, COMFORT. I have sore feet issues, and these are comfortable.
They are not tight enough, or supportive enough to be used for running distances.",3,0,14.0
"Horrible customer service. When shoes were purchased it said on Amazon's website that it was ""Free returns"". I received the shoes and they were a .5 size too big, but when I went to return them I was told I would be charged to ship them back and that would be subtracted from the refund price. That is not a ""free return"". Tried contacting customer service of League Outfitters and was told that was Amazon's Policy and there was nothing they could do.",1,0,14.0
I work in a small carpeted department store which is were I wore these. I’ve had them maybe three months and they just fell apart. They look really cool but for the money I can’t recommend them unless maybe you are in a wheel chair and will never walk around in them. This isn’t much different from most products now tho everything cost the same but is made cheaper. Crap product crap brand.,1,0,14.0
I'm not an avid runner but I do run shorter distances (1-3 miles). I was in the middle of a workout that had running and lifting and realized this was the worst shoe for either of these. My foot moves around in the shoe while running and the sole is to soft for lifting. Maybe they would be ok if you never made a turn but if you run around the block you feel like your foot is going one way and the shoe is going another.,1,0,14.0
Love the lite racer series. However these have been worn for a month and the soles are worn almost all the way down. The last 3 pairs 8 bought lasted 6 to 7 months before replacing.,3,0,14.0

I bought them as a gift for my brother The shoes ripped thru the front while he was running on the third day he used them not great quality for a size 13 foot apparently,1,0,14.0
I don’t know if I’m the only one having this problem but it has an annoying bump by the left side of the shoe in the left shoe. It’s really annoying I tried wearing them for a couple days but it feels the same,1,0,14.0
Definitely needs quality control,1,0,14.0
"Unfortunately, after one day of wearing these shoes one of the straps across the top snapped loose and now it just hangs. Poor design. I really like the shoe, it fits great but now it just looks silly. Trying to fix it but not sure how to tie the tiny sting that holds the loop together.",1,0,14.0

"Love the shoe, and completely happy so far straight outta the box I have one complaint though. The color option was not what I picked. I asked for a pair of the black on white trim shoes. Instead I to my own disappointment received all black... I'd go through the return process but it's just a hassle.",2,0,14.0
"You cannot run in these shoes, they have no support. They cushy and better for lounging. Have fun jogging in these if you want an injury",2,0,14.0
This is my 3rd pair of the lite racer adapt 3 in size 13. My favorite shoe so far. First time purchasing off Amazon rather than adidas website. But this feels fake. Not comfortable/padded bottom. Tighter and more narrow than my other two pairs. Either they’re fake or they had a lapse in quality control. Looks real,2,0,14.0

They fit great & very comfortable. Unfortunately less then a month of having them the side broke and laces are all one piece so cannot be fixed. Very disappointed with them. Not cheap so should last more then a month.,2,0,14.0
"Runs very large! My son’s current Addidas were size 11. We ordered a 10 and they are still too big. Got a 9 and 9.5 and the 9.5 fits perfectly. Great shoe, sizing is way off.",3,0,14.0
"Pros: Comfortable shoe. The fit was larger than expected but I could put up with that.

Cons: Extremely fast color fade. My black shoes are now purple after two months. I just noticed this hole as well and since I bought two months ago I can’t return them. I’m not very happy. Might have to switch to Nike",1,0,14.0
Not even three weeks old and already falling apart. The bottom tread is almost warn flat. From an 11 yo boy to boot. Terrible shoe. I expected more from adidas.,1,0,14.0
Amazon denied my return request for some reason I’m not entirely sure but they said it was outside of the window which wasn’t the case because it was only one week when I first submitted for return do no recommend,1,0,14.0
There is not way to tighten the shoe and the opening comes down way too far. It feels like a slipper not a sneaker.,3,0,14.0

"The eyelet design is bad, I should've known but I wanted them to work. An eyelet ripped within a couple months of purchasing, so now I have a left shoe that is tight and the other is loose on the front left of my right foot. I would give a 5 star if they had designed the eyelets better. But without working laces it's not a running shoe anymore. The shoe is best meant for casual slip-on wear, no inclined or declined running/walking as it puts stress on the poor eyelet design.",1,0,14.0
Felt like the shoes were stretched out or a wide fit. They looked better in picture. Very lightweight and ran big for the size.,3,0,14.0

"The shoes were decently comfortable and light. I’m a waiter and bought them as work shoes. During about my 7th shift, I looked down and saw the lace dragging in the ground.

No, they were a little big. Nothing that does not solve thick socks, it is not as big as unwearable... not that much. But that was not expected ...",3,0,14.0
It's was a great shoe but only lasted a few walks. I liked the concept of these laces but they have a major flaw.

These shoes were really comfortable from first fit but the quality is poor. I received my pair in January and they are already shredding. They started a month in and now are almost too bad to wear.

"I've owned these shoes for 2 months, and they are really comfortable, but sadly after wearing them only about 8-10 times, they are already breaking down. There is a small hole forming on the interior, near the heel of the foot, which has caused me a minor blister, so I won't be wearing these for walking anymore. They are still fine for when riding a bike (since you aren't really moving the shoe much, as it remains flat on the pedal for the most part). Incidentally, this is the second problem I've had with blisters forming due to an Adidas gym shoe, so think I'll be switching brands.",2,0,14.0

I’m assuming that the black ones must be a fake Adidas product. These are going back!",1,0,14.0
I have ordered Adidas shoes from in-store and have been satisfied. Once I received these in the mail I knew right away that they were not actual Adidas shoes. They are cheaply made and just crappy.

I am disappointed that this stuff even exists in the marketplace. I hope to find some REAL Adidas shoes.,1,0,14.0
"These shoes are light and very comfortable for walking and light running. However, the bottom treads are not durable at all. The attached picture shows the significant wear that occurred after ~65 miles of outside walking over 35 days. The top portion has worn down enough that a shallow puddle will seep water into the shoe. These shoes will probably last longer if you do your walking on an indoor track or treadmill. However, pavement/asphalt/gravel, especially if warm, eats the soles up.",2,0,14.0
"The soles of these shoes are quite squishy. I am not sure how it happened, but the soles started to become permanently compressed on the inside heel. Soon the shoes started to wear unevenly in that direction. Before I knew it I would catch myself walking with my ankles collapsed in and started to feel Valgus knee pain. This was with a Dr. Shoals insert as well. I have never had this happen with any other shoes and I swapped these out with a pair of new balance with a harder rubber sole and the ankle collapse immediately went away. Also, there is no tongue to these shoes, and it was tight around the tops of my feet.

That said, I am 6'6"", about 275 pounds, and I workout a lot. Perhaps it was more my weight that caused the soles to compress and turn in more than it being a design flaw. But I would caution against these for anyone on the heavier side to avoid ankle and knee issues.",3,0,14.0
"I own a size 11 pair that I bought on the store. I bought this one exactly the same model and color, just to replace my worn out one.

The rubber sole was stiff and actually hurt my feet, far from the characteristics of an Cloudfoam sole that usually makes you feel you are stepping in marshmallow.

Not sure if it was just a defective unit, but be aware.",1,0,14.0
"These are really nice and stylish shoes. Very comfortable for casual wear and walking. Areas where I had trouble was the lack of arch support and impact support while running on pavement. I've been using normal arch support from most shoes and this one was pretty flat. Also, the padding/cushions on the soles did not absorb as much shock as other shoes I've had. Basically after a couple of runs trying out the shoes started to get shin splints because of the lack of cushioning and arch support. I still do really like the shoes for walking and casual wear, but won't be using these for running on pavement.",2,0,14.0

Because of the foam sole they are not good for cross training or weight training. As seen in the picture he back of the show has two tabs. One of the tabs projects about an inch from the shoe, which looks odd and not necessary. The body of the shoe is more of a sock, it fits very snug on the upper foot. One things I did not like was the laces. The laces don’t actually make the shoe any tighter. There is no tongue and the show is not cut down the middle. I wear these jogging without the laces. Better shoes out there.",2,0,14.0
Returned them! The tongue is sewed into the sides of the shoes making the entrance holes for a child’s sue size!

"These shoes are very comfortable and I love that they are slip on style type of shoe. The shoe though is a little tighter than I expected, they fit snug on me but if you have a wide or fat feet, these shoes may be too tight on you.

After they became broken in I realized how comfortable they were just to wear around the house. They slide on and off almost like a loafer. After one year I'm giving these 4.5 stars.",3,0,14.0
I have had these shoes for only two months and using them for only taking walks.

overall adidas tends to run large . these dont have true laces nor tongue so cannot make them snugger around feet if desired like a traditional sneaker. was difficult to see that on my phone when ordering. these should feel good on wider feet. have the great soft foam footbeds if you need cushion from hard floors or just long hours on your feet. i wont recommend for a narrow foot cuz if you try to tighten laces then fabric bunches up and doesnt look good.,3,0,14.0

"I am a huge fan of Sambas, and I have been wearing them for years. About two years ago, I ordered a pair from Amazon, and they were great - the same, true product I had been ordering from the corporate Adidas website. However, I was not as satisfied this time around. Immediately upon opening the box, I knew these weren't the same shoes I had previously ordered, even though the page indicated that I had ordered the same item previously.

Appearance: The glue around the sole that attaches it to the leather boot/sock of the shoe is sloppy, chunky, and visible. The sole itself is a totally different ""gum"" color than the previous pairs I own. I realize the color changes over time, but I have not ever owned a pair whose sole was very dark brown. Some of the eyelets for the shoelaces are not completely punctured, indicating poor factory quality. I would most likely need to stab a knife through the unpunctured eyelet to make way for the laces, but since I intended on returning them I did not do this. Finally, the leather looks incredibly cheap and plastic-y.

Fit/Feel: As soon as I tried the shoe on, I knew it was not the same shoe I have been wearing for years. I have broken in SO many pairs of Sambas, so I am aware that they fit a bit differently when they are new, but these ones felt like stiff, sharp, plastic socks. I have been wearing the same size, 8.5, for 20 years, and the arch on this shoe did not fit in the same spot on my foot as all of my other ones. Also, these ones felt narrower (mostly by the pinky toe) than my other pairs. I have pretty narrow lady feet (which is why I like this style of shoe), so it's rare when I find a shoe that is too narrow for me. These shoes definitely feel like a knock-off. I am just going to pay the extra money and order directly from Adidas.",2,0,14.0
"These are NOT AUTHENTIC Addidas! They arrived in an box that looked authentic, but the shoe inside definitely WAS NOT. My husband has authentic Addidas and I bought him the exact same shoe as a replacement, and these do not even come close to the real thing. The tongue is not leather but a weird foam, I assume because that's where the logo goes?? The gum sole was not correct either; completely different color and texture than the real thing. I do not recommend purchasing, especially when authentic Addidas are only around 10 bucks more.",1,0,14.0
Very disappointed. The sole of the shoe fell apart the third time I wore them. The circle tread on the bottom of the right shoe ripped out completely. I had Sambas before that lasted years. These lasted 2.5 indoor soccer games. I would like to return them but it's too late. I will not purchase another pair from Amazon. I will buy my next pair from a local shop in hopes that they will take a return if this is a problem with adidas manufacturing.,1,0,14.0
"Like others have noted here, the newer Sambas seem to have a problem with the circular part of the sole below the ball of the feet. I've worn Sambas for years without issues. I ordered a new pair and immediately noticed the rubber of the sole seemed darker and less pliable. When I wore them to the gym for the first time, at the very start of a cone sprint exercise I stepped on something rubbery. When I went back to look I realized it was a big chunk of my shoe. On my next turn, the other shoe blew out. I had worn these all of 10 minutes to that point.

My previous shoes, ordered about a year earlier had the same problem but it took a bit longer than a day to present itself.

I have ordered a replacement pair, but should these also fail it may be time to move on to another brand.

Update 12/11/2018: New shoes, same problem. I put another pair into use in August and by early December the sole on one of them had blown out in the same place they all blow out. I only use these for weightlifting and basic floor exercises, and as you can see from the pictures the rest of the rubber is barely worn. The rest of the shoe seems to be fine, but the circles are a definite weak spot that negate the otherwise fine quality. On to another shoe/brand for me...",1,0,14.0
"Once liked this model but as some have noted they appeared to have changed the leather, it feels more plastic.
The worse part is the rubber they use for the sole, it squeaks badly on tile and many other surfaces, this drove me nuts fast.
I wanted to love them again but I just can't.
Oh, the arches seem higher as well and they glue the insole to the bed so you practically need to tear the shoe apart if you want to replace it something else.",2,0,14.0
"I purchased these because my current Sambas are getting a little worn. And, wow, I'm extremely disappointed because I have a strong, strong hunch these are knock-offs. If they are real, Adidas have gone significantly downhill. I returned my pair after spending about 10 minutes with them.

* The leather isn't leather at all - it's 100% vinyl. Even the Samba Vegan model has a better look than the flat-looking, textureless vinyl on these.
* The outsole/bottom of the shoes I received wasn't the typical brown, but a dark gray, almost black.
* The tongue was hilariously long (going above my ankle when worn) and was made of some weird foam (instead of leather). None of Adidas' shoes (from their website) represent the same pattern or length.
* The arch was excessively, uncomfortably high. No pair of store-bought Adidas I have ever owned felt like this.
* Even the stitching on the outside of the shoe, while close, doesn't match the patterns on Adidas' website.

Buyer beware. This is not the Adidas I know and love.",1,0,14.0
"At first , I was excited to get these shoes again..upon receiving them, I immediatley noticed that they are not authentic. What gave it away was the shoe laces hole was double punched and the material was not leather. They didn't even make it on my feet from how obvious this was. I don't understand how Amazon lists this items and doesn't even notice that these are knock offs and not genuine. They should have a quality control department monitoring items as such since it is ""fufilled by Amazon."" Either way, I sprung for the $20 dollars and ordered the real ones.

"I used to buy Sambas & other Adidas sneakers in Paris every few years, visiting family, because my foot is a perfect 41 EU Size, which isn’t sold in the US. Hello Covid! No travel. No sneakers. For real no sneakers, not just no perfectly fitting sneakers. Because American Adidas? Are constructed of the WORST craptastic materials (a plastic tongue? Really??? Just…no. And why are pieces of this shoe glued together rather than stitched???.), and the quality control at whatever factory is being used is nonexistent. Lumpy, mismatched, substandard, pinching, loose, torn.. in the same pair! Much less line 3 pairs up together.. I’m shocked and appalled Adidas would put their name on this junk, much less stamp them as Sambas. I thought, perhaps, these were cheap knockoffs so I went to a local shoe store, and nope. These… things… are the “real” deal. At least as far as their American market.

Hard pass. I love Adidas Sambas too much to compromise. Real leather. Real gum sole. Real stitching, with real thread. I’ve seen cheap knockoffs that do a better job at mimicking Sambas than Adidas does with their American market shoe. Maybe Canada gets the real thing. It’s worth a 2 hour drive to find out!",1,0,14.0
"I tried really hard to make these shoes work. I first wore the size 7 in black (I typically wear a women's size 8.5-9)- purchased from Academy. I tried the 7.5 on in the store and my heel slipped in them no matter how tight I tied them, so I went with the 7. They felt okay walking around other than the high arch support and a tad bit tight in the toe box, but during my soccer game I lost both of my big toenails (I have no idea... I have never had this happen). So I attributed it to my shoes being too small, even though they didn't really feel all that small. Fast forward- I decided to give the size 7.5 another chance and purchased from this seller because they were cheaper than box stores. During my soccer game, my feet were constantly cramping up to the point that I had to come off the field and take them off for a second just to get some relief. Also, at one point, my left shoe slipped off in the middle of play. I tried breaking them in by walking on the treadmill at the gym with the same result- constant cramping. I removed the arch support as others stated on here... still uncomfortable. I even trimmed the insoles so that there is less of a ""hump"" aka Adidas idea of ""arch support,"" but my feet still cramped up after wearing them for just a few minutes. I also cut the tongues down because they drove me crazy (I used to tape them down, but for some reason it is uncomfortable on these shoes). Anyway, I performed 3 different surgeries on this shoe to no avail, so I have essentially wasted $130 on 2 pairs
of the most uncomfortable shoes in the history of all time.",1,0,14.0
"So, I bought these shoes to ride my mountain bike in as I wanted an alternative to mtb shoes which aren't that attractive. I've worn Sambas for yeeears.
They look great, fit well...Basically... Sambas but for some reason these ones have an incredibly chemical smell (Acrid like burning rubber) to them. I noticed it slightly when I first got them, even before I opened the box so I figured I'll just air them out. Seemed to improve. First time I wore them when we got to the halfway point of the trail and everyone took a breather someone asked what the hell was that smell and I realized it was the shoes. Let's just say I couldn't take them off when we got back to the truck.
This time when I got home I actually had to leave them outside. After a day they were still reeking so I figured my only option was to scrub and wash them as I had worn them so figured I couldn't return them(they were muddy...it's MTB)
After washing, drying and airing the smell was faint. I decided to take them for a short walk. By the time I got back they were stinking again and so were my feet. They're basically unwearable but have been worn and washed so I can't return them. I've owned over 10 pairs of Sambas and never had this issue. I even bought a white pair the same time as these and they're perfectly fine. It's bizarre. I plan to contact Amazon but I don't think they can do anything about it.
I'll update if they do",2,0,14.0
"I used to wear these during residency exclusively in the ER. Cool style and comfortable. The new darker soles are a change for the worse to me and need to go back to the gum rubber color sole. The long tongue has also become something I don’t want to deal with and it makes zero sense to have to pay $30 more or really any price more for the standard tongue. I also appreciate the adjustment suggestions but don’t want to go through the hassle of making my own cut and attach adjustments. So for now, I’m going with the Puma Super Liga, Solid alternative.

I use these for a little light soccer and juggling and walking around town. Would love to get back into them but I’ll need those changes mentioned above to go back.",3,0,14.0
"I have worn Samba's for years, and it was time to get a new pair. When I opened the package I was expecting to see the usual blue box with white stripes, but that was not meant to be. The shoes came in a gray box and said ""End Plastic Waste."" These were not the Sambas I was expecting.

After doing some searching I was left more confused than I was when I opened the box. The suede felt different than my others, but was that because these were new? The sole is a a darker shade than my other pairs as well.

After doing some internet research, I could not come to a conclusion on these shoes. Adidas has shoes on their website made of Vegan materials in their ""Made of Recycled Content"" line, but that has a gray suede front, and this pair says they are made of leather.

At this point, I have not tried them on, so I am reserving final judgement. I will be updating in the future when I know more about how they fit and feel. They are supposedly Sambas, so I am expecting the customary break in period before they are truly comfortable. Others have stated these do not last as long as well; I honestly couldn't tell you the last time I bought a pair. My current pair is at least three years old; hopefully the new pair lasts that long.",3,0,14.0
"I live in Japan. Father from United States bought me a amazon gift card. Unfortunately, I cannot use the USA amazon gift card here in Japan. Separate company.

Whatever. So, I ordered these shoes, have the same exact ones from 5 years ago. Old shoes fit perfect but I wanted new ones that weren’t falling apart. Same size. Same color. Same style.

I ordered these on USA amazon and the item is not as depicted. Too tight, stabbing pain in the sides. I even tried longer laces to loosen up the uncomfortable tightness. Still blisters.

Unfortunately, since I live in Japan... the return process is unfair. Amazon will only refund 15.00 $ usd to return the item back to the USA... it costs 9000¥ to ship the item back to the USA for some item that is defective.

"Being on a budget but looking for a good affordable shoe in the brand that I like, this one caught my eye. Not too pricey I decided to give it a shot.

My first impressions : I LOVE the look of the shoe, matches well with my style and the brand that I enjoy, price range good but you'll get what you pay for.

Comfort : Overall the shoe fits great, enough space although my only 2 gripes with this product are that it absolutely lacks sole, worn these for a week now and the bottom of my feet are hurting, not enough cushioning for my taste especially if you're up on your feet all day like I am. I'm already looking at replacing the sole and seeing if that will make a difference. Secondly I dont like the material the shoe tongue is made out of, it feels like a cheap foamy material that will most likely rip later after some wear and tear. I'll be sure to update later down the line, other than that maybe next time I'll just look for a shoe with a similar style and just pay the extra 15-20 dollars. Not bad if you need something stylish but willing to sacrifice a bit of comfort in the sole area.",3,0,14.0
"I’ve been wearing Sambas for 25 years. I buy a new pair every couple of years. The pair I received was nothing like what I remember. The gum soles are an odd color and the whole shoe just feels cheap. I went to Dicks Sporting Goods to look at their selection of Sambas. They looked just as bad as the pair I received from Amazon. It looks like after many decades of building a quality, inexpensive shoe Adidas has decided to cheapen this one. Time to look elsewhere.

I could easily wear a single pair everyday for a year without incident. Now I buy TWO pairs of these for $60 each, wearing them in alternation, and the inner backs of all four shoes have completely torn away into the cap/frame (see image). What happened???",1,0,14.0
"Arch support is too high and is very uncomfortable. The first day I wore them it was noticeable but not uncomfortable, but the second day they were really uncomfortable after being on them for about 5 hours. I stand all day, so I was hoping for comfortable shoes. If you're not on your feet all day they might be fine.
Someone on here said you could remove the insoles which helped but they're still a bit uncomfortable. I put flatter memory foam in but they still feel weird. With no insole they're ok. But because these are made to be light, there isn't a lot of cushion. Really disappointed in that regard.
That said, they're really cute and I'm still keeping them.",3,0,14.0
"I've been wearing Sambas my entire life, but these aren't the OG's. These showed up with black bottoms, and not the classic gum-bottom color, so that's a red flag. Upon a quick search or two on Adidas & soccer.com, it seems all the original Sambas are sold out right now (except for tiny sizes). Also, wearing them around the house, my heal slips with every step. It's not the classic fit, the material is almost slicker. I will always be a fan of the classic Sambas, but I did not receive the right pair.",3,0,14.0
"Although this is advertised for futsal I definitely do not suggest so. For whatever reason the cushion inside the shoe is lifted on the inside to support the arch but it's lifted so much it started to hurt right after a few changes of direction. I never before these had blisters on my arch, an unpleasant feeling I do not wish on any player. Adidas makes some nice shoes, these are not one of those.
I was going to return them but let too much time pass by. If you try them and feel pressure on your arch, return immediately",2,0,14.0
"***FAKE BEWARE***

These arrived in a non-descript box. Not an Adidas box. Tags that are on the shoes also don't reference Adidas anywhere (see attached picture) After trying them on, they were too large...which is odd because I've had the same size Samba's before and they fit great.

It's unfortunately past my due date to return, so they'll go to charity and I'll go directly through Adidas to purchase.",1,0,14.0
"Really not the same soft, comfortable fit. These are hard and stiff. I pulled off the ridiculous white stick-on arch support under the insole out and cut around the arch support in the insole.

A little dissappointed...they feel fine and i wear them but the pics of the show show the sole as brown and I thought that was interesting and thats the reason I purchased them. Sadly in real life when inspected closely they are brown...but such a dark brown they just seem black. I wouldn't have purchased them if I knew they looked the way they did. Other than that they seem to be a good comfortable shoe.,3,0,14.0
This is a complete misrepresentation of a Real adidas Samba. I've bought real leather Sambas. Amazon advertised REAL LEATHER. This shoe was 100% not leather. All man made material. I had to send it back. Come on Amazon you can do better.,1,0,14.0
"Sorry but everyone who purchased these sneakers have just paid $60 for a $15 knockoff. Just scroll through the pics that others have taken and compare for yourself. Inconsistencies in the font, the stitching, the sole material and the quality in the leather and suede. Totally inferior product. Go to Adidas.com and look at genuine sambas. Take a look at the font. These have a taller ""squished"" together looking font. Notice the stitching. The stitch that wraps around the stamped name is very rounded. The stitch on a real pair is nearly a 90 degree turn. The color and ""feel"" of the sole ""rubber"" is not right. Overall shape is off. Real Adidas would not have all these inconsistencies. Buy authentic Adidas directly from their website or at least know what to look for. Compare for yourself and make a educated purchase.",1,0,14.0
"For the price, I can't really complain. I've had this pair of Sambas for over a year and they've held up well, but there were a few things I'd caution potential buyers on:

1. The pair I received are not authentic Adidas Sambas and are cheap knock-offs
2. The first month or so wearing these shoes out of the box was pretty uncomfortable as the sole insert in the shoe felt super high and it took a while for it to mold to the actual shape of my foot
3. The shoes are not well ventilated / breathable and very soon after purchase, I noticed a horrendous smell coming out of these shoes. I've never had issues with foot odor before and these are the only pair of shoes I own where I have this issue. It's pungent to the point that people across the room would be able to smell it. I've tried multiple remedies, such as washing the shoes, using baking soda, etc. and didn't have any luck.

For the above reasons, I will be throwing these shoes away. I recommend spending the extra money to get a real pair of Adidas Sambas.",2,0,14.0
"Just got these - immediately noticed that the sole of the shoe is not the classic brown as shown in the product images but BLACK. I don't mind and will keep them, but odd and NOT what I ordered.
Quality and construction seems legit. For some reason the insoles have an extremely high arch which may end up hurting my flat feet. Will see as time goes on, I may have to replace the insoles which is annoying. I've had Sambas before and they were much flatter inside.
I'm a 10.5 typically but my last Sambas at 10.5 left me with a little room which wasn't ideal for playing soccer in. I got these at a half size down, so a 10, and they fit kind of perfectly snug. If I was just wearing casually I may opt for the 10.5 for some extra room and comfort, but these work for me.",3,0,14.0
"These are just not comfortable. The arch inside is very high which has no cushion, if that’s what you expect than you’ll like them. The other feature here is a very long tongue, they are almost like a shin guard, making it uncomfortable to wear pants. Again if that is what you want then you’ll love these. For me it was like wearing a really bad French Kiss on my ankles, way too much tongue for me. Instead I bought the originals directly from Adidas, with the blue label on the tongue, and those I love.",3,0,14.0

I've been buying Sambas for 35 years and whatever they did to it this time around I'm not impressed with at all. Hard to describe but I don't like the fit. I've had them for about 6 months now and they should be well broken in at this point but I get blisters on medium length walks. Still go to my old pair for long walks. After 35 years I'm probably going to need to check out other options.,2,0,14.0

"Indoor soccer shoes are the best for table tennis. I bought these because of the medium/low price tag. The tongue is huge and absolutely destroyed my ankle after 4 hours of play while I was wearing short socks, to the point where it completely scabbed up by the next morning. Hoping higher socks will take care of that problem. Probably a non issue for soccer players though. They look great. The fit is a little big which I had read in other reviews so I ordered a size 10 instead of 10-1/2, so go a half size down and you'll be fine. The grip is good as expected. My next show purchase will be something different.",3,0,14.0
"I have worn Sambas religiously since 1995. I LOVE them. My third pair is wearing thin in the sole after 8 years of constant wear, so I thought I'd order a replacement pair. These are horrendous. I'm pretty sure they're fake. I really hope they're fake because I can't believe Adidas would downgrade their classic shoe so drastically. They're made of some sort of plasticky faux leather, and the sizing is about a half size too big. I'm returning these and headed to a shoe store. More money, but at least they'll be leather.",1,0,14.0
"LOVE the look, but I can't find a pair wide enough for my (not particularly tall or wide!) feet. I'm happy to break in the leather, but this kind of side overhang is just ouch.

I have been wearing sambas for 30 years. Did Adidas decide to change the look of the shoe after all these years?

I am going to look elsewhere for what I expect.,1,0,14.0
"I'm a solid nike 11.5, converse chuck 11 and these adidas 11.5fit me well, but are on the bigger, loose fitting side. I wouldn't play soccer with the way they are now because they're not snug.
I wore them everyday for many hours standing a work, hoping they would break in and be comfortable, but the arch support and interior of the shoe feels low quality and they really hurt to stand in all day. It just feels lumpy as opposed to conformative or supportive.

I used to have adidas back in the day about 15 years ago and they were very comfortable, but these aren't the most comfortable, though I usually wear them all day anyway.",3,0,14.0

I’ve worn Sambas for over 35 years and these are not the same sneakers I grew up wearing. The arch support is ridiculous. Thanks to another reviewer I was able to remove them.

Tight fit bad for wider feet been painful these last few days don't think i can break these in either. Cheap soles cracked within 3months.

"I used to be regular user of Sambas, buying them time and again. After a few years' break, I decided to return because I had always liked the style and comfort. Unfortunately, the shoes have changed. Now, they are far too narrow at the front area around the toes. They are even rather narrow for using in indoor soccer, but for regular day-to-day wear, they are intolerably narrow and I had to return them. It's unfortunate, because the style remains great, but the sizing is just too bad. I'd also add that the arch is a bit excessively large, but that wasn't critical in my decision to return these to the seller.",2,0,14.0

Returned it and haven't bothered with ordering a size up. No reason, its a garbage quality.",1,0,14.0
"I got it because it was cheap and I had been going through 2-3 running shoes a year and didn't want to pay the stupid premium for ""women's shoes"". However, there is little in the way of padding, and as is typical for Adidas, they run on the narrow side. They're so thin, I can't add more padding to offset the problem.

I always order shoes based off of their EU size because they always fit.

Or they did. If only they were a bit wider and didn't leave me limping after 2km from lack of padding in the soles and rubbing my pinkie raw. Was the correct length however!

They seem okay wandering about the neighbourhood, though.

"So like so other reviews, this is my first pair of sambas and they are a little snug. I've always been told I have a narrow foot so it seems strange these fit tight.

"Purchased as a Christmas gift for my Boyfriend; his usual size(11) was too large but otherwise perfect. I returned those and ordered a half size smaller- at a significant increase in price, no less. We just received the more expensive replacement pair and they had not only obviously been worn but were literally dirty- there were scuffs and dirty marks in several places on both shoes! The first thing I saw when opening the box was the sole of the left shoe, heavily encrusted with what I sincerely hope was mud but may very well have been dog poop!! The fact that the correct size was fifteen bucks more was bad enough but receiving dirty, used shoes- which are badly needed for an indoor soccer game tonight- is just insulting!!!! I have requested a return and will have to wait even longer for a THIRD pair of shoes. And they had BETTER COME AT A DISCOUNT!!!",1,0,14.0

What the heck Adidas? My six year old beaten up Sambas are much more comfortable than a pair that I purchased this month! Why make the toe box smaller?! The shoe was absolutely perfect before but now they are uncomfortable to wear. The fabric by the toe bends into a sharp point and it is kind of painful. I am pretty disappointed actually. I am not the only one who has these complaints either! Plenty of people have been experiencing the same distress. Adidas listen to your customers for goodness sake!,3,0,14.0

"They really don't make these like they used to. For those unaware, Sambas used to come in leather and kangaroo leather (Samba K). They later started making these, the Samba Classic, as an affordable option (same looks but nowhere near as durable). I'm not sure when the quality Sambas quit getting made, but the K was finally discontinued in 2012, leaving only this Classic/economy version. I really regret not keeping my Samba K's from 20 years ago and re-soling them, because I think those shoes could outlive me. The cheap ones that are the only ones available since 2012? Not so much. Adidas really should have kept the quality shoes an option, but planned obsolescence is the name of the game these days.

As for what I mean about quality, I wore holes clean through to my socks in both shoes exactly where the ball of my foot lands in less than 20 hours of play on AstroTurf. In fact, the entire sole wore down very quickly.

"*Dec 2016: Six months after having the shoes they are already ripping apart. My husband only wears these once maybe 2 times a week if he is lucky.

"So this is actually my second pair of Adidas that are totally unwearable despite being the correct size. I wore their sneakers as a teenager and they were wonderful and comfortable, but I guess this just isn’t a good brand anymore. Initially I had the same issue many have mentioned here with the shoes fitting size wise but the toebox area feeling really tight even though they’re not too small lengthwise at all.

So I noticed that the “cushion” insole was in there really loose and I wondered if it would be better if I just took it out, so tried that. Ok, instantly much more normal shoe fit. The insert is far too thick and crushes your feet from the bottom, it’s not a width issue.

Unfortunately even after that made it a somewhat workable shoe, they just will not break in and are very uncomfortable. They are stiff as all hell and I mean I gave them a month of daily use because I like how they look. But yeah, I will not be purchasing this brand again, total waste of money.",1,0,14.0
"To preface I am used to sketchers, to be more specific the Skechers Men's Classic Fit-Delson-Camden Sneaker which you can grab for about the same price. I would way recommend these as ive worn them for about 2 years and while the sole has worn out and they are stinky if you have multiple pairs of shoes (and you buy the right size) these shoes will last and feel great. The are flexible light weight and extremely comfortable, if they didnt stink I would wear them every wear because they make the ground feel soft when its not. Good for tennis as well tight enough to bend to your command.

Now to the review these shoes, they are stiff as a board, and the back is as well. I walked around campus for about 20-30m (not all at once) taking 50m breaks because I was in class. After about 10m of this I at a scrape on the back of my left foot. Tbf I was wearing low socks but whats done was done and I could not take back that scrape. Due to this I am letting my foot heal and I cannot break in these shoes. The look nice and have good inner-soles but I wouldnt buy again id rather buy more sketchers.",3,0,14.0

"The quality/design of these shoes has changed. I'm a distance runner and I've been a religious Boost fan since about 2015. I've purchased at least a dozen pairs of different models over the years through here and other retailers and have loved them.

This past March I purchased 2 pairs of adidas mens Ultraboost 21 Running Shoes from Amazon.com and they are absolutely terrible. I rarely ever have blisters on my feet however, with the new design of these shoes I get blisters in every run over 5-6 miles so I cannot use them for longer runs.

Terrible. Absolutely terrible.

I've tried them over and over again but the issue repeats. $360 down the drain.

The previous versions of boost were fantastic...if you can find the older versions purchase those instead...you will likely be very disappointed with these...

"I have mixed feelings for these sneakers. On the one hand, they ARE comfortable and they ARE a decent pair of sneakers. However, they are a lot less comfortable than my ultraboost 4.0s or any ultraboosts of that time. They are bulky and heavy in comparison and are extremely snug (size between 0.5 to 1 size bigger!) While the shoes are decent, I find it quite difficult to justify the $180 price tag on a pair of sneakers that are, pretty much in every way, inferior to their predecessors. Although, it has ""more"" boost, it does not translate to any increased comfort. Overall, a decent shoe experience if they were named other than the successor in the Ultraboost line-up; but as an ""Ultraboost"" shoe, I am afraid they come up short.",3,0,14.0

Two issues:
These shoes are very snug and feel like a compression sock. I have narrow feet so I would assume they would be uncomfortable for those with wide feet.

After my second run, the insole on my right foot started sliding backwards. After my third and final run, they were almost coming out of the shoe. I have since initiated a return on these shoes.

"I got the correct size but man these things are so tight i can feel my pulse in my foot throbbing. These are more of an aqua water shoe in where its like a little elastic bootie that you put on with laces that you don't really need. They are that tight.

The front is very narrow and really squeezes your toes together. They have plenty of cushion but being they are so tight i cannot enjoy them. There's no way of making them looser.

As for construction....they are great quality, well made, stitching is good. Soles are thick and full of cushion as well as made of recycled materials. Kudos for all that but darn why so tight.",3,0,14.0
"Ocean plastics waste is an increasingly visible problem. Not only the problem, however, but also a few solutions to reduce the amount of plastics are popular for environmentally conscious customers. While it would be best to eliminate the plastic from ever entering the ocean, what's already there poses a thread to wildlife for a long time aside from simply looking bad.

Adidas is providing some publicity to the ocean cleanup by using the materials in portions of these running shoes. That certainly is also a way to wash that corporate conscience. It is not completely clear which material is from the ocean, but there is likely plenty new material, too. (My guess would be the neon yellow/green hard plastic frame.) Adidas: ""This product is made with Primeblue, a high-performance recycled material made in part with Parley Ocean Plastic. 50% of the upper is textile, 92% of the textile is Primeblue yarn. No virgin polyester."" So I guess it's part of the upper (only?), actually, that's sourced from ocean plastic. (The massive sole being fully new materials.?)

Anyway, the upper is a stretchy fabric that's more like a sock. The ties are to secure the shoe better, but there is no traditional tongue. What's traditional though is the use of laces. In fact, the sock part of the upper is fairly tight that the laces almost seem unnecessary. I got my size, and typically shoes half a size smaller still fit comfortable. These sneakers not so much, and although I understand that they should be intimate with your feet, they almost feel I should have gotten half a size bigger. The sole is unique in only the very tip being flexible and the rest fairly stiff. The heel is likely a result of the boost function to add a bit more spring to your step. (There isn't an actual spring, of course.)

The sole's heel is oddly shaped and although functional not exactly attractive. It's different though, and that's sometimes all that matters. There are a few different sections that are of a different color/material. Continental is embossed in the toe section, indicating also the use of that company's material. (Not of the recycling kind)

The white design is not the best to hold up to daily wear and tear, or mostly dirt, but it's a popular decision for running shoes. They don't glow in the dark, but with enough imagination, they might especially with that squeaky clean conscience. ;-)

Of course, the shoes sport the trademark three stripes, albeit that section is unexpectedly stiff. The placement does not make it a problem for comfort though. The upper material is soft and stretchy. Aside from being hard to put on, the material tends to be itchy when I decided to wear them bare foot.",3,0,14.0
"Adidas' Ultraboost 21 running shoes have a lot going for them. The cushioning, particularly in the heel, is excellent. The shoes absorb the impact on my heel and the Ultraboost midsole gives me plenty of arch support and comfort. The mesh sock upper is extremely breathable but it is also very awkward. It forms around my foot like a sock and the sizing is a bit off, resulting in a flat toebox that flops whenever I run or walk. The hard plastic lacing structure sticks in my foot a bit as well.

I've used a number of running shoes over the years including an excellent pair of Mizuno Wave Enigma 5's that I've had for a few years now and they are still going strong. I don't get the long-lasting vibe from these Ultraboost 21's. I have a feeling that the mesh upper will wear out quickly.

While I love Adidas, I don't love these particular shoes. If you're looking for longevity and a decent fit (or don't like the sock like feel of these shoes), look elsewhere.",3,0,14.0
"I'm an avid runner and always turn to the Adidas Ultraboost line for my daily trainer since 2018. I've definitely seen the show improve year after year, with the Ultraboost 20 being my favorite. I got the Ultraboost 21 when my previous pair wore out and something is off here. 20-mins into my treadmill run I noticed a sharp pain in my left foot coming from something hard and pointy from the side of the sole. When I took the shoe off I couldn't feel anything with my hand but I had a painful blister on my foot. I still have no idea what in the shoe caused the blister but when I put it on again I immediately felt it. Needless to say I returned it straight away.

They also added 20% more Boost in the heel, at a ridiculous 30 mm high stack, but becouse is very compressed it a actually feels harder than the Ultraboost 20s.

"firstly these aren’t the clouds you’re used to walking in the OG Ultraboosts. the boost in the heel is polarizing due to it’s supersized nature and they make your feet like a whole size longer. they’re comfortable enough but not for $180. these were $129 on Amazon

"A big disappointment. Not nearly as good as previous versions (20 and 19) of Ultraboosts. The reason for purchasing Ultraboost would be for the wonderful cushioning under the whole foot. But this version (21) has only a good cushioning under the heel and not the forefoot.
Before going on a run I always test my shoes at work by walking in them and these were the most uncomfortable running shoes yet. This could be just an individual thing as everyones for is different but I can't believe how different and much worse the 21 version is compared to 20 or even 19.

"Uncomfortable and they are not waterproof. I thought they were.

I play golf using a golf cart early in the morning when there is some dew on the grass. No rain and no puddles and minimal contact with damp grass, yet my socks are wett after 18 holes.

Since there are dozens of other reviews and questions referring to the same problem, it seems that this is a systemic issue and Amazon is shipping regular-width shoes in boxes that say ""wide.""

"I need a wide show, and the listing for this shoe said it was side. Looking at it however, it looked very narrow, and fit the same. My feet were hurting within minutes of wearing them. I tried twice walking around to see if they would break in, but they didn't. Also I've learned that many shoes in the label put a E if the shoe is side. There was not such indication in label size of this shoe. I think it would be a good shoe, if it fit me.",3,0,14.0
"Ordered 12W. As others have noted / asked, the product really is not WIDE. The box says 12 WIDE, but the tag indicates 12D, which is medium in US nomenclature. The shoe's length is fine - just as I expect for a 12 in US sizing. But the width is a bit narrow mid-foot, and is exceptionally TIGHT in the toebox. (Admittedly, I have a wide toe-box. Love the old Reebok CF Nanos with their wide box.) Also, it's rather tight over the top of my mid-foot. (Admittedly, I have a very high instep (?), such that I need a wide AND tall toebox.) I do believe the shoe will stretch a bit and will be much more comfortable over my foot. Much more concerned about pinching in the toebox. So I will continue wearing at home in an attempt to stretch it out.

On the plus side, the shoe is exceptionally light, and the sole has good gripping power, albeit this is dry / summer weather, so less critical. If the shoe stretches out, it will be comfortable with THIN socks (no way can I wear it at the moment with thick socks).",3,0,14.0
"The picture does not do it justice. Nor, do many of the reviews. Only found one that said the shoe runs narrow and has a narrow style.

If I returned them, I would not buy this shoe again, as the style does not fit my feet.

I have always worn a size 10 1/2 wide shoe. According to Adidas size chart I decided to purchase the extra wide golf shoe in size 10 1/2 after comparing their measurments to my actual feet measurements. The shoes seem snug at first and after playing 1 round of golf I removed the shoe and found my sock a bloody mess. Their shoe are at least 1/2 size smaller than advertised and not near an extra wide as advertised. Ended up giving them to my grandson who normally wears a size 10 normal width. He said they fit perfect. I will never by shoes online again unless I'm sure the size advertized is accurate. Extremely disappointed in a brand name shoe. I'll stick with Footjoys.,2,0,14.0
Reviews are good for this shoe and apparently its the #1 selling golf shoe on Amazon however I've played 6 rounds in the spike less version and had my feet slip a couple of times costing me strokes. I would return them but threw the box out when I opened them. Ill just use them as walking shoes but I definitely wanted to warn others not to go this route unless you don't require traction. There is a reason Pros still use metal spikes after all and its not so they have less grip to the ground.,1,0,14.0
"The shoes look pretty good and feel comfortable while walking and wearing. My problem was that they were very difficult to put on. I had a hard time getting them opened up enough and the back was so flexible there was nothing to help me pull them on. I usually wear a 10 1/2 size and these shoes are size 11, so one would think they would go on easier than they did for me. It was difficult to spread the laces open far enough so that I could slide my foot inside. I had to physically pull the laces, one by one back down the lace channel a long way in order to manage the task. I think they might be a bit easier if I carried a shoe horn with me.",3,0,14.0
"I have wide feet and these fit great, but they do not keep your feet dry with wet grass from morning dew. These are also a lot of trouble to clean the wet grass from the bottoms.

"I was hoping to get more than one season (of summer golf) from these shoes. But that didn't happen. While comfortable, they were not the least water resistant given the porous material above the molded sole. The fact they were not water resistant wasn't a surprised or the reason I don't like these shoes. It was when the molded sole separated from the upper shoe portion that prompted my low rating of these shoes.

"honestly these are great but... one of those ""dangerous to buy online"" situations. keeping them as they work great but the heel design is the ""two pronged"" version that i should have noticed. be prepared to band-aid up at the start at least. then tend to run a tad thin to boot imho (i have never ordered or worn a ""wide"" for any shoe but these feel like i should have. both issues are solved to some degree by lacing up very loosely and with high backed socks. honestly it's a good show but know the above before you buy :)",3,0,14.0

I find a sneaker shape shoe in wide is better for my feet. I thought I would try these for the price and and the reviews. I even got a 1/2 longer than usual and wide but just not wide enough. I probably will just end up giving to someone.. Do not order these if you require WIDE shoes.",1,0,14.0

Not only is the insole super flat but the toe box is much narrower at the outside edge so it pinched my pinky toe in.

They clearly are not sized to a true 11.5 and the build of these shoes is very cheap.",1,0,14.0
"Have several adidas and these fit, length wise, perfect. I thought they would be more like sneakers and not require a break in period. Wore them to walk 9 holes and got blisters on the ankles.

Great shoes but the way they are manufactured creates a cleaning problem. The mesh material on top of the shoe is overlayed on a material that stains and cannot be cleaned.

I have purchased multiple pairs of Adidas shoes most of them through Amazon and other sites and typically the shoes fit according to size and of good quality. This particular pair was way too tight and too small. Although the shoe appears to look very nice upon close review of the faux leather it doesn't seem like it will last very long.

It's been a couple months of very regular use and I just can't take the discomfort anymore. They make my feet cramp, my toes hurt and they leave painful red skin on the top of my foot where the laces are, are too tight. Also I noticed the heel part of the shoe is deformed. I tried slipping them on once and I crunched it down and I haven't been able to get it back to its regular shape yet, so it's just soft material in that spot with no real support.

"Just received the shoes and tried them on in the house just to get a feel for it. Will update later down the road but these are my first impressions:

1) I used to own the AX2 in size 9 and they fit perfectly. I purchased these in size 9 and they also fit, which is a plus that there’s hardly any deviation in size.
2) Like other folks are saying, the heel feels kinda loose no matter how tight you tie your shoes. This is concerning, so I’ll have to see how well it holds by the next update.
3) There’s hardly much for cushioning or arch support. If I recall correctly, my AX2 shoes were comfy to wear regarding arch and cushioning. These however you will have to buy different insoles to match your arch unless you have flat feet, but even then you may need to buy new insoles to deal with the fact the factory insole doesn’t have much in means of cushioning.
4) For those coming from Salomon shoes (I wear men’s size 8.5 for Salomons) I would recommend getting a half size larger, hence why I bought size 9 for adidas.

Compared to the Salomon Speedcross 4 which is the pair of shoes I’m replacing, I like the fact they fit my wide feet without a break-in period and the treads actually feel like they have good traction. However I don’t like the lack of arch support or cushioning which the Salomon speedcross has.
Hopefully I’ll remember to update",3,0,14.0

I'm also peeved at the seller because I paid almost $10 for delivery and will have to pay more then $5 to return them.

"A modern looking shoe with what seems like a funny fit, and seems to need considerable breaking in.

I picked a 10.5 (my athletic shoe size), and found the the fit...odd. The toe is pointed rather than rounded, so there's extra space at the tip, but my big toe hits the front. Odd design, since feet don't have a point in the center... Even cinched tightly, my heel slips a little (but doesn't come out). I'd need to use a spacer or wear heavy socks. The fit is okay at best.

The sole is pretty rigid for a lightweight shoe, like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a trail runner or a hiking shoe.

I may be spoiled by other brands that are ""ready to wear"", or may not be used to Adidas' design choices. But I don't want to spend the time breaking this shoe in hoping the fit is better once it's well-worn. It's going back.",3,0,14.0

I’m not sure what’s up with Adidas these days. Part of what I like about the brand beside durability is the true-to-size attribute throughout their line.

The house shows I bought from Walmart literally for better than these lol

While they did look nice, and felt comfy while standing, they were just too loose on the heel. Not sure an average size persons foot could fill them out.

Amazon refunded them promptly and I decided to order some ASICS trail shoes and they fit perfectly.",2,0,14.0

Bought this as my second pair of AX 3 hiking shoes. I bout the blue pair from a different seller and they fit perfect. Ordered these in the same size and the toe is extremely tight. My feet are always warm so I like room for them to breath. The blue pair is great this pair not so much.

I generally wear an 8 in shoes and an 8.5 in athletic sneakers/runners. I got these in an 8.5 and they fit quite well - EXCEPT - wow is there something wrong with the way the backs of these shoes curve. Right into your achilles tendon with exceptional force. I saw other people mention this in their review but I didn't think I'd have a problem with it because I always wear socks with a very cushioned heel tab. You can see the black stripe on my sock heel in my photos- it's right where this hits my achilles tendon. And it does not help. At all. These were so painful. Even just standing - not even moving - they dig in and hurt. I only lasted a minute or two wearing these around my house before I packed them up for a speedy return. I'd only recommend these if you don't have achilles tendons.,2,0,26.0
"I know my bad review is strange since these are my second pair. I’ll explain…. I bought my first pair at Kohl’s and I was stuck with them because I wore them outside sooo I went through very uncomfortable long walks & workouts with horrible blisters on both heels (caused by the high heel design and rough material) until eventually they became bearable while I continued looking for a new pair. (clearly I haven’t been successful). I’ve had them for 1 1/2 years and they finally fit to the point I’m not uncomfortable but the cushioned footbed is flat & worn & I have a hole in the front left shoe so I need a new pair. I would normally never walk around with a hole in my shoe but I’m having a hard time finding a new pair. I finally decided to order these, I wasn’t excited to get the same exact shoe but thought I’d go up 1/2 size , that would definitely help and deal with it. I’m not convinced I will keep them. I feel even though I went up a 1/2 size I’m still going to get blisters. At this point I need to go into a store and try them on which I’ve done several times 🤫 After reading a lot of reviews (after I received) it seems it’s a design flaw for the blister issues! Also, I remember when I bought my first pair I thought they were super comfortable, that was NOT the case once I went out on a 2 hour walk😭 I know everyone has different feet these might work for some people but not for me.

"Well… the shoes took more then a week to arrive. Came in a nike shoe box well packed. But as u can see on the pictures, I don’t think it’s suppose to have the bare foam exposed like this in a original nike shoes! Makes no sense to me. To be honest, u can’t notice the bare foam on the seller’s pictures page. So, I am not sure if this is original! I don’t think so. But I will paint the foam black and I guess it will be ok. But be aware that the shoes will come like in the pictures.",2,0,26.0
The tongue of the shoes have exposed foam on the top and look unfinished. I am not pleased with this at all. Would like to send these back and get the correct ones. Paying 150.00 for these shoes should entitle me a pair of shoes that are finished.,1,0,26.0

"The box came torn and held together with a rubber band. The shoes themselves have clearly been tried on (debris in the tread and the laces were untied). Also there is a very noticeable dark spot on the top of the left shoe. The Nike “swoosh” looks like it has been re-glued to the sides of the shoe and overall, the appearance is poor. I was really looking forward to getting these shoes but can’t say I’m very happy now.",2,0,26.0
"Received this product and first thing I noticed is I received the shoes in a plastic bag with no tags or nothing. When I touched the material and instantly knew these were knock offs right away. I own plenty of Nike shoes and these definitely were not real. The material is very cheap and thin. The stitching is extremely weak, not reinforced well and finally the foam on the bottom was cheaply made. I ordered $20 shoes off of amazon once and it felt like the same exact material. Not a Nike shoe for sure. Might as well buy the real deal for the same price they are selling these poorly made shoes. I was disappointed in the quality, not worth the money.",1,0,26.0
"I ordered a 7.5 and it fit really tight, which is unusual because I have narrow feet. I also sustained an injury from the shoe digging into my heel after a 30 minute walk.

"I've had gym shoes that I have to work in before, but these are not work in-able. I have had these for a few months now, and, every single time I wear these, they rub my ankles until they bleed.

If it weren't for the rubbing, the shoes would be supportive and comfortable, with the rounded soles making walking very easy and cushioned.",1,0,26.0
"I’m a huge fan of Nike running shoes, but these are not my favorite. I bought these specifically for running (I run ~15miles/wk). They run slightly small compared to my other Nikes, so I’d recommend going up a half size.

After running in them now for about a month, they don’t provide as much support as I’d like, and my ankles/arches are hurting midway through my runs, which I’ve never had a problem with before. I tried running in another pair of Nikes the other day and no pain. So, overall, they look great and maybe good for the gym or walking, but I wouldn’t recommend them for frequent runners.",3,0,26.0
I had these in all black and was pleased with them (they crease easy) so I ordered the navy blue ones. The first time I wore them they were fine. Yesterday mid workout I started to experience numbness in my left foot. It’s as if the left shoe shrunk overnight! I have zero room in my toe box but only on the left side. My other pair are perfectly fine. Wore the navy ones again and tried to be more conscious of how the shoe fits and the left shoe is significantly smaller.,2,0,26.0

But if it can’t support my arch at the try on stage, then unfortunately they must go back for me.",1,0,26.0
"Love the shoe! BUT these are for running in the gym, not outdoors! I live in a rural area and run in the street. By doing so I collect pebbles on the sole of my shoes. Make it difficult to run long distances and to also I bring in the pebbles into my home if I do not remove the at the door.",3,0,26.0
This is a nice workout shoe. The reason I rated it 3 stars is because of the uncomfortable ankle flap on the back of the shoe. I don't understand why it was designed the way it was. It runs painfully on the Achilles tendon when I walk. I don't feel the flap during high intensity workouts and short jogs. I wish it was not there so I could wear the shoe for walking also.,3,0,26.0

"If you are wondering whether or not to order these shoes from this seller....don’t do it. The shoes I received are NOT authentic Nike. I knew as soon as I saw them that they looked a little weird. Then I when went to put them on they were large and clunky. This is odd when Nike is known to run a half size small and especially odd when I’ve worn the same exact for more than 20 years. The inner sole was hard as a rock, not soft and cushiony the way a nice new pair of Nike feels, the outer sole was made of the cheapest plastic that made a click-clack noice when I walked not the nice quality rubber Nike uses, and every step I took made a crunching sound which I was never able to tell exactly where it came from. As I examined more closely there were so many errors in the stitching where places did not align the way an authentic Nike would have. There were many differences in the shoe pictured and the shoe I received. I did not think to read the feedback/comments before I purchased as Nike is a reputable company and I’ve never had an issue with fake shoes but as my suspicions kept growing I went back to read others experience and many others also caught on to the imposter shoes so this has been going on for quite a while.

I purchased these because the reviews were great and I love the colors but they ended up being just ok. They seem very basic with no added padding.

"These shoes look so awesome! In reference to how they look, great! I received multiple compliments. Comfortable when putting on! My nephew tried them on and said ""Wow, they're so comfortable and squishy."" lol. Unfortunately, they were not good for working out(cardio and weight lifting) . They are quite a bit heavier than I expected. And after wearing them at the gym for awhile, they really hurt my feet. It felt like the top of my foot was injured lol. Probably best for just wearing out to the store or out to dinner or out to a movie. Not great if you're planning on being active on your feet for a long period of time. Or, maybe they just don't work for my high arched feet! I really wanted to love these! I had fully planned on ordering several colors...but they just hurt my feet lol.

"I'm not sure if this is one of the Amazon products with fake reviews. Shoes were delayed in shipping waited approx 2 weeks. Arrived in with very little packaging shoes did not have the typical stuffing etc inside that you usually find with new shoes, shoe box was beat up and looked like these shoes may have been returned once already. Shoes ran very small were difficult to put on and take off. padding on inner shoe did not cover the entire shoe there were two separate raised padding one oval shaped just under the toe area was hard and uncomfortable, placement was off the other was in the heel area. The added cushion may have been nice except it wasn't a cushion and did not move with the weight of my foot so it was simply two hard raised area on the inside of the shoe. Overall the shoe was stiff and very hard, definitely NOT for any type of workout or even long walk, there is ZERO support in this shoe. I can't imagine wearing for anything other than a photoshoot. They are very cute and the color is exactly what I wanted, but overall the shoe is simply cheaply made lots of visual design, but no actual functional design. I am in the process of returning this shoe. Would not recommend. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!!",2,0,26.0
"Size: fits as expected.

Style: I'm not terribly fussy, but all of the giant writing on the sneakers, which looks a bit ridiculous online, looks absolutely absurd in real life. And the sneakers make my feet look a bit huge... All that said, I have problems with my feet (plantar fasciitis and being on them consistently, so my feet are hardly ever not sore in some way) so I don't give a much of hoot about style if the shoes are comfortable and the price is right.

Comfort:
~~ Soles: The soles of these sneakers are really quite solid; given their open and airy design. I was hoping they'd have a bit more give and spring and impact absorption to them. They do not have any spring, and very little give. They're also a bit noisy until broken in. They aren't uncomfortable; they just not aren't anything like as cloud-like to walk on as one might suppose.
~~ Insoles: The insole left sneaker is perfect and perfectly comfortable. The right sneaker has an abnormality in the molded structure of the floor of the sneaker that puts pressure on one side of my right heel that is very uncomfortable, and given enough time would cause a blister. If I pull the removable insole out, I might be able to sand or carve down that spot inside the sneaker, but nobody should ever have this problem with any kind of shoe. If the right sneaker were like the left sneaker, these would be perfect.
~~ Sneaker body: Light weight, breathable, comfortable. No nasty sweaty hot feet problem here.",2,0,26.0
"I purchased the shoes for my 11-year old daughter. The shoes were so narrow she was unable to slide her feet in them.

"I don't know where all these people are walking that are giving 5 star reviews! I work in a warehouse, with concrete with 3 levels and I walk all night, up and down stairs.

I had high hopes for them cause of the reviews but not one review ever stated they worked in a warehouse with concrete. Well this is that review, for anyone else who does. Take your chance, I did and I wasn't impressed.",1,0,26.0
"They are really cute. Not gonna lie. They do have support inside which feels right when I slip them on. But when I stand up, they are stiff as hell. And when I walk on them, they are louuuuuud, clunky, and don't have much flexibility to them AT ALL so it feels like I'm walking flat-footed. If I were to bend them in a video, they would seem flexible to you, sure, because they are not made of steel. But I'm telling you, when I walk, they do not move with my foot naturally like a good shoe should. There is nothing lightweight or comfortable about them. They also hurt the top of my foot after a bit and the back of my heel as well. Not from rubbing, but from the stiffness. I can wear narrow-footed or normal shoes. I have normal arches. I wear size 8.5 to 9 so I got size 9. They fit fine. I like thicker socks anyway. I wore them in my house all day. I'm gonna try to break them in at home. I will NOT wear them in public and be stuck with sore feet. If they don't soften up, I'm gonna change my 2 stars to 1. The only thing I like about them is their visual attractiveness.

Update: I have been wearing them around the house every day for about a week or so. They do not feel any more comfortable than they did on Day 1. I can probably get away with wearing them to the store for grocery shopping but definitely not to work. Sucks. They really are cute.",2,0,26.0

"I'm not one to bash products on Amazon, but you need to be warned. Buy these if you like rock hard plastic platform clogs which are nearly impossible to put on. The shoe size was correct for me but the mouth of the shoe (that's the best way to word it) is so small that I could barely put my foot through it. They don't have a traditional tongue and laces; it's a single piece, so there's not a lot of adjustment room. The soles aren't flexible and there's no cushion inside the shoe with the exception of a few small air-bubble-like pseudo-pads which compress to nothing as soon as you put a little bit of weight on them. These are really cheap shoes and they look cooler online than in person. They weren't damaged or made of tissue paper, so I didn't give them a one star rating. I guess it's possible for people to like them if they aren't too picky.",2,0,26.0

Everyone was raving about these shoes and how comfortable they were so I purchased a pair. I am on my feet all day 12+ hours. These shoes were comfortable for the first 5 hours and after that my feet hurt more than ever. If you plan to be on your feet for expended periods of time I would not recommend these shoes. They are very stretchy and i felt the comfort that way but the comfort on the bottom of your feet after a long day is not great.,3,0,26.0
"I loved the way these shoes look. After reading the reviews, I thought they would be good to work out in. I wasn't planning on doing a marathon (even with the glowing reviews). But I did expect them to last longer than they did. These shoes were delivered to my home EXACTLY one month ago (07/12/2021) today. My first time wearing them was a few days after (I have a black pair that I had been wearing but they were showing wear on the soles-I had but not worn for a year. FIRST CLUE).
Long story, short. Decide what you want these shoes for.
If you want them for looks GREAT! AND you can't beat the price (I've gotten compliments-they didn't know my feet were killing me)
If you want them for anything more than that; DON'T BUY THESE SHOES!!! Look at the photos, I average 7 miles a day walking, on the road so you decide if you want to do a more forgiving surface. But even with that, you have less than 300 miles in less that a month and this (view photos again) this is the wear you have? I did not include the photos of the blisters-that would be too much.
LOVE the look (I still have a blue pair that I haven't worn) but hate everything else. I HAVE TO BUY MORE EXPENSIVE SHOES NOW!!! Hope this helps.",2,0,26.0

"I really loved how these looked and the sole felt comfortable and supportive, but the sizing chart is not accurate. I ordered a US size 9 based on the chart on their listing, which shows to be 10"" but the size on the box shows it's a bit smaller than that. All of their shoes show US sizes. I would've reordered a different size because I really like the shoe, but they have the size 40 as a US 9, 9.5, and 10 and a 41 as a 10.5. The 10.5 on the size chart on the listing is half an inch bigger than the 41 on the box.

The shoes are nice but the tip is showing glue like it will separate soon. Returning because for the money it should be a better quality.

"Decent shoe but has its cons. Love the color choices for sure. Non-slip is not accurate however. Walked into work with such little wetness on my shoes I never hesitated to be cautious and my first step onto the finished floor I slipped and barely caught myself. Wasn't expecting that at all, since in over 2 years I have never slipped at work before. The right shoe has a squeak when I walk which gets annoying quick since I walk about 10 miles a day at work.

The main reason is that the shoe is a bit hard so I feel going up in size may be best and you can add a foot insert to make these shoes great.

"I've only worn the free flyknits for the past 2-3 years. I ordered a size 8 given that is the size I previously ordered, however, when I compared my old shoe to the one that arrived a few days ago, the new free flyknit is an inch longer.

The tag however says size 8. Perhaps Nike changed their sizing, however that does not seem likely. Unsure how the sizing could be this off.",1,0,26.0

"I bought this pair of shoes thinking the color was different, but the shoe itself was exactly the same as the ones I bought last time. Like getting the same car model make and year, but a different color because you got in a wreck and wanted the same beloved, never broken down car and had to bring the new one to the shop within a week because it broke down. There is no way these shoes were really Nikes. The first time I wore them while taking a long walked, my left foot hurt and seemed slightly shorter than the other one, but I pegged it to that I need to loosen it up. The second time I wore them to the fair grounds on a hot day. I was screaming silently with pain and if I had to walk with my shoes on any farther on to the car in the back I was going to take my shoes off and walk on the burning gravel ground. The Nike shoes that I have been getting for decades are great, but these same sized and seemingly the correct and good colored Nikes were painful and did not fit or made properly which are now at the dump. So be careful that you receive actual Nikes.",1,0,26.0

Kept wearing them while I tried to find another pair of sneakers and eventually a hole wore through on both outer soles completely to the inner sole and the back inner ankle on both shoes wore away to the outer fabric withing less than a year.

So I just received the shoes today and I tried them on and they seemed very thin maybe because they want them to be breathable I don’t know really.

I spent the summer in PT and I'm still dealing with residual hip flexor pain, but at least I can run again. I did A LOT more research about sneakers and bought a pair of Saucony Ride ISO for hip support. I love my Sauconys and they weren't that much more expensive then these Nikes. If you are just in need of an inexpensive sneakers that look good to wear while you do weekend errands, these Nikes are probably fine. BUT I strongly suggest you do NOT buy these as actual running shoes. Your hips will thank you!",1,0,26.0
"They run a bit small for 9 W. There was no specific arch support. The shoe doesn't support the foot at all. They're cute, they were reasonably comfortable, but a sport shoe they were not. I returned them.",2,0,26.0
"I’m a 9.5 or 10 and I got the 9.5 in this shoe. Super cute!! My only complaint so far after working out 3 times is that I got the WORST blisters on the back of my feet. I had to take them off and walk the rest of the way home because it burned so bad. Now I have to figure out how to get the blood stains out of my new white shoes. I haven’t had this issue with other shoes but these seem to hit just above where my socks cover and they rub with every step on the back of my ankle. I did notice the “bulging” issue on the sides of the shoes as other reviewers mentioned, but so far this hasn’t been an issue with how they fit around the foot.",3,0,26.0
"I was disappointed to receive these shoes and find one of the insoles not properly adhered in the shoe. It was bent and didn't reach the top of the shoe. Had to unlace the whole shoe, peel the insole and reapply it. Then when I put the shoe on, the inner exterior side of the shoe was warped like it was a worn shoe. The shoe itself fits well. The insoles aren't that comfortable because they seem smaller than the shoe itself, but overall for the price, they will do.",2,0,26.0
"Not sure if this is a counterfeit brand or what, but the sizing was way off. I've always worn the same size in Nike shoes, and ended up having to return these because my usual size was WAY too big. I tried wearing them right after they were delivered and they pretty much fell off my feet. Didn't seem to be bad quality at all, just the sizing ruined it for me. If you're committed to buying these, I recommend going a half size or even a full size down from what you normally wear.",3,0,26.0
"The shoes fit great- I’m usually a size 8 and ordered an 8. However, the color was definitely not what I expected.

Definitely not what I wanted and not my style, but I’ll have to end up keeping them because I’m too busy to return at this point, hence why I ordered shoes online.",3,0,26.0
"I walk 5 miles a day on pavement. I have worn out many pairs of Nike Flex shoes. I got the Revolution style the last time. From the first time I put them on, I had trouble with them. The curve in the back of the shoe is way too deep and cupped, and it's causing chronic pain in my left heel. I tried changing the way I lace them, adding heel inserts, etc. Nothing works. I usually get 400 miles out of a pair of Nikes. I'm getting rid of these before I hit that mile marker.",1,0,26.0
"Although these shoes are as cute as can be, they are lacking a little in the comfort department. Wearing them around as normal is fine. But as soon as I ran in them, it was like immediate shin splints. I was disappointed there wasn't more support in them since they have the word ""running"" in the title. However, for walking around, they are comfy enough, but my recommendation is to find something else for running.",3,0,26.0
"Bought these shoes for work having to stand 8 hours straight. I own many Nike shoes and these are the first ones I’ve ever purchased that have hurt my feet this badly. I can barely walk in the front door of my house without feeling my feet breaking g underneath me.

"I have purchased several pairs of Nike Airs over the years because they are super cushy and comfortable and give me a lot of protection from impact and made me feel light and bouncy on my feet.

It is worth it to invest more money for a higher quality running shoe.",2,0,26.0
"The shoes are so beautiful and I really wanted to keep them, but it really lacks arch supports. I wore them around the house for a few hours and they really hurt my arches. Also seems too light and cheaply made to be real Nike, but maybe that’s the trend companies are doing mow.",1,0,26.0

Well I forgot that Nike runs narrow. I wear a 9 so I ordered 9.5. The length is perfect. The width is not. I wore them to work one day and my feet were killing me by 10am. Tooo tight ! Will find someone with narrow feet to give them to.,1,0,26.0

A few hours later I decided to get on the treadmill, only walking at a 3.0 for 30 minutes the not really rubber soles looked like the 1st picture and were shredding.

My job has concrete floors and mid-way through my shift my feet are ACHING, far more than usual. I'm not able to wear these shoes to work if I'm scheduled for a full shift so I have to use them only on rare short-shifts.

They aren't terrible, they just don't work for my needs. If you're getting them cuz they're cute then they should be fine but don't buy them if you're going to be working 10 hours on a concrete floor. They definitely do NOT work for that purpose.",2,0,26.0
"I got the neon green and it's really neon in color!
The unique design is very much like another pair of shoes from another seller, so they are maybe made in the same factory.
This came in a ziploc bag and arrived earlier than the expected delivery date. These are not as lightweight as the other shoes, but everything else is identical - flame design on the sides, the plastic at the bottom and the thin rubber soles glued to the bottom hard plastic. I like that there is a pull tab on the tongue so it makes it easier to pull it out.
The vamp or front of the shoes is mesh so it makes it cooler and air out (I guess).
I normally wear 7 1/2M but from reading some of the reviews that said they come big, I ordered the size 7. They fit ok, wearing them with medium weight socks, but after about 20 minutes of walking around the house on both hardwood and tiles floors, my feet were hurting.

I think it was the sole of the shoe that I could feel.

The body of the shoe is too generic meaning it doesn’t have much shape. Like it is meant to fit a wide variety of widths. The sides are a bit stiff so it’s difficult to tighten them. The sole is just ok as far as cushion. Because they are a bit wider the toe box is roomier and I felt like I didn’t have enough support. So just average. The outside sole is very hard not giving like the picture might lead you to think. The color is fun though. Would not buy them again though.,2,0,26.0
"I normally wear an 8.5 or 9. Since they don't carry half sizes, I got the 9. When I walk, my feet literally come all the way out of the back of the shoe.

They seem comfortable. They do not at all squeak like that one video... I was hoping they wouldn't. And the white is white and not yellowed like like some shoes I have received from Amazon in the past.

"Thought these would look great with a tan. Runs extremely big. Ordered size 9, more like a 11.5 or 12.",1,0,26.0

"Pretty, poor quality",1,0,26.0
"Such a cute shoe. I was surprised by the hard plastic sole. I expected rubber. Also, the insole is pretty hard. I thought the insole might work, but decided they wouldn't. I've read where others have had a better outcome. I returned them.",1,0,26.0
"I gave it 2 stars only because they are really cute. The back flip flops, but my toes fit perfectly, so I can’t go down a size. I walked less than half a mile in them and my feet actually started burning. I got home (just over a mile total) & I had a massive blister on the bottom of my big toe. These are DEFINITELY not meant for walking or running - maybe just for looks when going out.",2,0,26.0
"When they arrived, they looked larger than the normal 11 mids that I usually get. I checked the label inside and it shows the US size as 11-12. As I am more like size 10-3/4, I was concerned as I hate loose sneakers. Turns out that they are only slightly larger than a standard size 11 and were the perfect size for a gel insert to be added. They are light and comfortable and since I put inserts in about half of the sneakers that I buy, for this price, I find these a good deal for the money. The air soles on these actually work to reduce shock to the heel. No durability info as yet but I would recommend these for an inexpensive everyday walking around sneaker. Folks that run a lot probably wouldn't be looking in this price-point anyway, so I would not recommend for folks that heap serious abuse on their running shoes. For the average Joe, I would recommend these.",4,1,8.0
I have purchased three pairs of these shoes in a couple of colors and am totally satisfied. They look good and I find them to be really comfortable. I use them daily for my five-mile walk. I’ve also worn them on the tennis court. The first pair held up for six months before I thought they were too worn down in the heel. (The rest of the shoe was still in great shape). I thought that was pretty good for an inexpensive shoe.,5,1,8.0
"I felt totally tricked by Amazon ,I searched for Nike air shoes and they advertised these as Nike,they are not! And the quality and fit are not the same, the shoe felt like a flat tire . I was really dissapointed and offended until I found out it would cost 6.00 just to return them. Now I'm pissed",1,0,8.0
"I have purchased some unbranded sneakers from Amazon before with comparable price and they not even close when it comes to the thoughtful design and good quality. They are little bit tight and I have to remove the sole padding and replaced them with sole T75 heel and arch support. I have multiple foot issues, notably, burning sensation on the sole once I put on a pair of shoes, and this pair reduced the pain a little bit, and so elated to welcome the little improvement. Another thing is it’s an attentions getter. My coworkers noticed them and I got a lot of nice compliments. I recommend thede shoes!",4,1,8.0

Great sport running shoes for my husband. They are so comfortable and so soft. He is in love with running every morning and sport. So this pair of shoes are great for him. He will buy for sure one more pair (another color). High quality for a perfect affordable price. Highly recommend,5,1,8.0
"The Shoes have terrible cushion. After using them 3 to 4 times for a slow jog and mostly walking it feels like the heels have as much cushion as a pair of $.99 cheap flip fop sandals . Totally disappointed, as they look good but they are not for exercise use.

"These shoes I ordered were 1 of 4 different pairs / brands. With that being said they were the only off brand I bought. So these shoes are WORTH the low price. They are VERY comfortable, and also true to size. I wear these shoes almost daily and so far ( I've had them for about 2 weeks now) there my favorite. I live in Alaska and wear these on nice sunny days with a red & or Black sweat suit. I definitely recommend getting a pair. Also they come in a really little cool shoes bag that makes them different than the regular shoe box. This brand / style is the only one I've bought from this company, but I will definitely be buying shoes from them again. I wear size 12 and these fit perfect.",5,1,8.0
"It is a comfortable shoe don""t expect too much though you get what you pay for. They are lightweight and been using them at the time I'm writing this about a month and i cant complain w i where them always everywhere. The only gripe I have is the shoestrings not long enough and that if you're a runner you might to break these in before you do any serious running including lacing the shoes.",5,1,8.0
"Very comfortable shoes to walk, run, jog, or to work in...I've already ordered 3 different pairs!! I use a pair for my Treadmill, a pair to do my chores in , and a pair to go out on the day in. I Love thst the shoes come with a string pull bag to carry around with you!! Nice!!",5,1,8.0
"I didn't realize until they arrived in a bag that they weren't from the major shoe company I thought they were produced by. Who knew that ""AIR' isn't trademarked by a certain large company? ;) My mistake, but they do seem comfy enough and will do the trick for the limited amount of wear I plan to put on them. Not bad for the price.",4,1,8.0
I love the look of this shoe. feels nice on the foot. the soles feel like plastic instead of rubber so they don't offer great traction. I feel as though I am about to slip when I'm wearing them. And I do use these for work. other than that the shoe is great,3,0,8.0
"Very comfortable but soles don’t last long. I got these in May and wore them a lot but only to work and the store. I’m in IT so I do a mix of sitting, standing, and walking around the office. I never did yard work, exercise, or anything else but the basics. The soles are already splitting on both pairs. It’s a shame, these are really comfortable albeit a slight bit tight. If you still get some of these and you teeter between 10.5/11 go with the 11 IMO, it was a bit tight for me but not painful.",2,0,8.0
Comfortable and nice fit. A little heavy by today's standards but I really couldn't complain UNTIL 5 months of 3-5 days a week wear and the bottoms of BOTH shoes spilt. Wear wasn't even that bad on either tread. They just split!! Very disappointing,2,0,8.0
I really liked the look of these shoes. They fit well but the bottoms were very cheap looking. It seemed to be a foam rubber with a plastic coating instead of a solid color rubber. I looked at a few reviews and saw photos of how quickly the bottoms of these shoes break down. Too bad because they looked nice otherwise. I actually returned these quickly and went to the Nike outlet store.,1,0,8.0
"Hey, for cheap shoes, these aren't bad! A little narrow, but they stretch a lil bit. But honestly, they're comfy and they look great. A lot like airmax at a quick glance.

"These shoes are absolutely amazing. They're super comfortable and also very cheap. They feel very flexible. The shoes aren't too tight and not too loose either. They feel super comfy and natural.

"Decent shoe, but the fit is a bit larger than true to size. Shoe is also heavy, especially in the heel. The sole seems to wear quickly and doesn’t have much tread. Even though ad says shoes work for tennis and running, that is not true. It’s not a good shoe for tennis or running.",2,0,8.0
"The shoes arrived as described. I loved the color and style, but were a little smaller than the 10.5 size that I wear. Probably would order a half size up for better comfort. I wore them to work, and half way through my shift I could feel my large toe rubbing against the inside.",3,0,8.0
"The view from Amazon shows Nike air max,
they are anything but, poorly made product that has not refunded me yet",1,0,8.0
when standing in these starting middle to the tip of the toes it is extremely soft. Good for around the house and walking but I would not run in these and surely wouldnt do squats. But over all it is a good value for the money spent. Does fit about a half size larger than Nike.,5,1,8.0

Purchased for a young one and could not really use the shoe. Fortunately the kid likes the look but complains about how stiff and uncomfortable for fast walking or running on a regular 400m track.

"I needed new shoes desperately so I spent some $$ ($82 to be exact) on some nice, comfortable looking “nikes�?but when I got them, they were the wrong color first off. Second, they’re complete knock offs. I compared them to my other pair of nikes and the swoosh, every bit of material is different and low quality. I didn’t expect knockoffs especially ones for $80!! So I returned them immediately and went on nike.com. They had sales on all their footwear so moral of the story, if you want brand name, go to the website 👏🏽",1,0,8.0

"The back of these shoes will dig in to your heel and make you bleed also the inside sole is oddly shaped and never conforms to your feet. Worst shoe I've ever bought. It's as if someone looked at a perfectly good shoe and thought ""how could we make these unwearable and as uncomfortable as possible...I know!

I've been wearing black Nikes for 5 years now. They are a simple comfortable shoe that has quality laces and sturdy design. Very lightweight and ergonomic. I'll buy another pair in about a year.,5,1,8.0

I bought these shoes thinking they would make my feet look invisible at night but when my brother said he liked my new shoes at like 10:00 I got really upset and sunk another 50 bucks on invisible spray paint that didn’t work either,4,1,8.0
"as a lifelong Nike fan, I have had dozens of their shoes. This is definitely the most comfortable for walking or easy jogging. Very versatile and I like them a lot. Assuming they continue making them I will buy another pair before long.",5,1,8.0
I used the Nike Free RN new and straight out of the box and did two miles on the treadmill at a 15-minute mike pace. It was basically a very slow jog and the soles are so flimsy that the wear looks like I’ve run on them for a month. Your can actually see layers peeling off. Save your money. The shoes have style but zero substance.,1,0,8.0
Comfortable! Easily the Best shoe I have ever owned. You won’t regret buying this shoe. Anyone who gives it a negative review must have been paid.,5,1,8.0
"Not a comfortable sneakers. If I wear them all day my feet and legs hurt. The cushion is really flat and you feel the concrete under your feet.

I bought these shoes for my 17 y/o son. He usually wears them 2-3 a week. He said they are very comfortable!,3,0,8.0
"This particular issue is amazingly comfortable and has really helped to ease the foot pain I have been having because of the excellent sole flexibility and cushioning. This shoe is very light and comfortable and can actually be slipped on and off because it is slightly elastic in the upper, which makes it feel a bit snug but overall one of the best athletic shoes I have ever purchased",5,1,8.0
"Somethings off about these shoes, also the size is way smaller then a size 13 men’s would be. They seem lower quality then the other pair I owned in 2018.",1,0,8.0
i am satisfied with the fit and comfort,5,1,8.0
"Not sure why this is the only 2018 RN on Amazon right now, but they fit perfectly, are super comfortable (like the previous 5 5.0's that I've had). They do look quite a bit different than older styles...way better in my opinion!...lots of new details. The delivery was super-fast!! May get another style...",5,1,8.0

"First off, I am an avid runner and have been running exclusively on Nike Free’s for over a decade. These shoes are comfortable, but they are moving backwards in design. Rocks and debris stick in the tread more than ever. The shoes are hotter, so my feet expand and my toes bruise more (I live in South Florida and it’s July). The back “lip�?doesn’t let your runners socks cover and causes blisters. This is not the best Nike Free, but it’s better than your traditional Nike runner. i run everyday with a long run once a week and my toes are bruised and nails black. This hasn’t happened since I stopped wearing cotton socks. Nike go back to your previous design...much better! I love the design to natural motion as it creates a basis for less injury and will still run in these shoes, but there’s been better before this one.",2,0,8.0
"So, I like these running shoes so much and find them so comfortable that I ordered a new pair, but I thought I'd share a comparison of the old and new shoes so you can see how the shoes wore (with me); and their pebble collecting feature is unbeatable.

Why I like them: I have flat feet and can't tolerate any arch support whatsoever. If there's the teenist amount of arch support, the pain is intense. These provide none. They're like wearing super cushy moccasins, which is the reason I initially bought them; and am eternally grateful to have them.

Your pebble collection: The design of the soles are genius for collecting stones of all kinds. You won't notice them while running, but I keep a little screwdriver handy to pick away at the stones from time to time (not while I'm running but once I'm home). It's actually kinda meditative. I also have a pair for walking, and only walking, and while strolling in Potsdam, at Sanssouci, where King Frederick's paths are paved with pebbles, they must have lost at least a third of their pebbles to my shoes. Never noticed though.

I'm a light runner. I might do two miles a day, 10 to 12 miles a week. I've had the blue shoes for 5 years now? Only about a third of my running is on pavement. Most of it is on paths and dirt roads (also excellent areas for pebble collectors).

They will not keep your feet dry. But they also don't soak up water. I've run in the rain with them and they dry out overnight.

The fit is tricky. I bought a leather version (for walking) of these shoes and had to buy a half size up from the (nylon?) mesh versions.

I was tempted to give them four stars, but the unrivaled pebble collecting feature easily bumped the shoes to five.",5,1,8.0
"I found a pair of these at my local Nike Factory store (size 10.5, black/anthracite color). They are VERY comfortable out of the box - the sole is soft and the feeling when putting on the shoe is similar to that of putting on an extra sock (it is snug, stretchy, and yet not too tight). The high heel tab (that supports your Achilles heel) is very soft and makes the shoe even more comfortable. Also, the shoe is very bendable/stretchable. In terms of fit, I normally wear size 10 dress shoes and size 10.5 athletic shoes. I tried both the 10 and 10.5 and felt better with the 10.5. So I would say - go with your usual athletic shoes size or go 1/2 size larger than your dress shoe size.",5,1,8.0
"The design of these shoes causes them to squeak with each and every step. It doesn't discriminate what surface you walk on, it squeaks regardless.",2,0,8.0
After a few months of wear I put on the shoes and as I tried to lace them up the lace holes ripped open. No way to fix them. Who knows? Maybe they're not even legit Nikes.,1,0,8.0
"Comfortable...check! Stylish...check! My basketball shooting skills have increased 23.45%...check! I now run more like a gazelle than a rhinoceros...check! While it may be impossible to quantify the true impact these shoes have on my life, what I do know is that when you’re shoes are comfortable and you feel light footed and confident in your overall presentation...anything is possible. When you’re a 43 year old guy like me and you put these shoes on, I feel like I’m 23.",5,1,8.0
"it appeared to me that these particular shoes have ""made the rounds"" so to speak. box was damaged, and I would bet good money that more than one person has returned this particular pair of shoes. The right shoe was defective in the toe area on the inside of the shoe. refund was delivered very quickly however. I did like the styling, bought another pair from a different source and ended up saving $16.",1,0,8.0
"I purchased these sneakers to wear during our trip to Universal Studios Orlando. I know that we will be walking around a lot and I want something comfortable and stylish to wear. These kicks fit the bill.

Style

They are extremely good looking. Much more so than I thought when I saw them online. I love the detail in the design and I have been wearing them whenever I can since I purchased them.

Comfort

The shoes are also very comfortable. The air cushioning and padding in the shoes keeps my footsies feeling great all day long. These are now one of my go to comfy shoes.

Recommendation

If you are looking for shoes that look great and are as comfortable as a cloud of air you need to pick these up.",5,1,8.0
"My husband has been on this particular shoe style for roughly 6 years now, and because he refuses to try a different style - I was relieved that Amazon saved my behind and had these. He loves them, they are the perfect fit and comfortable. He is on his feet for no less than 15 hours a day and I never hear complaints.",5,1,8.0
Fast shipping. Shoe look like floor model; one worn and one not. Very wide. Too wide. Tried to send back but UPS didnt pick up; then they refused the label and wanted to charge me so I went home and tried to get a new one. It generated the same old ticket. Wrote to Amazon but no reply > guess big bucks doesn't have time for those who put bread on his table.,3,0,8.0
"I dont usually buy sneakers for more than $50, but with arthritis in my knees, I needed to spend the extra for support. Not only did they help with walking but in a world of neons and fancy colors the black and silver gets noticed when I wear them out. Great sneakers",5,1,8.0
"I'm giving this two stars because they are uncomfortable. I work a part time job at Lowes 3 or 4 nights week. They only 4 he shifts, by the 3rd hour my feet are killing me and I cant wait to get them off. Other than that, they seem to be well made and are holding up, they are just uncomfortable.",2,0,8.0
"I was able to remove the insoles without much trouble so that I could put in insoles with good arch support. The tread is really nice. Sneakers seem to run smaller than regular shoes so I had to order a half size larger than I normally wear in my regular shoes. This is the third try on sneakers, three different brands but I ordered these a half size bigger.",5,1,8.0
This is the 2nd pair of these shoes purchased for my son. He has a wide foot and high arch so he needs the room at the top of the shoe to tie comfortably. He loves the shoe,5,1,8.0

"Nike Sizing Info:
Ladies, if you want to wear this shoe...I'm a 9 in Women's Nike which is equal to 26cm. This shoe's Men's size equalling 26cm is an 8. If you have your favorite perfect fitting Nike shoe, they print the size on centimeters on the tag under the tongue of the shoe.

I like the color styling for the men's version of this shoe better than the dull black looking women's version. Also...this shoe is currently $70 at Academy sports website and their sizes are all available. Finding this shoe in my size on Amazon has been a butt pain. They're wider than the usual Nike design which is exactly what I need.

I received the shoes from this merchant in a semi-beat up Nike shoe box held together with a giant rubberband but the quality of the shoe was perfect. I just had to return due me getting the size wrong.",5,1,8.0

"The Air Max Torch 3 is the Hummer of athletic shoes: it looks large and imposing on the outside, but is tiny and cramped on the inside.

The shoes I was sent appeared to have used, or at least taken out of the box, before--the shoe box looked like it had been mauled by a cat, see attached picture.

"Mine showed up in two days, brand new and never worn. I see a lot of reviews regarding size issues. Get whatever size you wear in Nike shoes and they’ll fit fine. Seems every shoe company’s sizes vary. I wear an 11 in Nike, bought a size 11, and these fit perfect. For those with wider feet, the toes are a little tight at first, but they loosen up after a day or so of wearing them and they’re really comfortable after that.",5,1,8.0
"My last Air Nike shoes which I had purchased, fell apart within two days of use. Well, the bubbles on the bottom popped and then afterwards, the soles detached. So I was a little worried about these shoes and put them to even heavier use than the previous ones to see what would happen, and they stood up to the wear and tear. They were initially a little tight at first, but after some use, they fit my feet just fine and did not fall apart at all. I'm glad to wear these comfortable shoes for the long-term future.",5,1,8.0
"I’d bought the model after this and enjoyed them until they had holes in the mesh. I went to the store to find out that they had newer models so I purchased them thinking they would fit just as good. But they didn’t, this model provides the classic arch support while also having a stylish Nike logo.

The only downside is that you might have trouble fitting in your true size, order a half size up if you have big toes. Also look for a possible defect on the inside of the shoe near the tip to make sure it doesn’t bruise.

Overall a 9/10.",5,1,8.0
Feel and look great to me. Wife already milked me cause of them That's an opinion and others may dislike them but to give them a garbage review cause your fat hooves don't fit is scary dumb.,5,1,8.0
Falling apart at the seams Literally,1,0,8.0
I was worried that these would be knockoff fake nikes. However I already have a pair of these and I compared every aspect of them. If they are fakes then they used every material and stitch that nike uses. These look legit. My last pair has lasted me a year and a half and are still going strong. I bought these because I know how they fit already and because the new nike designs aren’t my style.,5,1,8.0
"Been a Nike fan for years and now that I'm able to get a decent pair that catch my attention, I had to have these!

Loved the color & how it looked!
Not sure if Original or not, as detailing & materials are a bit undergraded
Size was a bit tight, as I used to wear Adidas 11.5, that is not available on NIKE (at least on Amazon). But am sure they will be ok very soon

"It’s a poor design. Don’t buy it. I am getting pain in the ankle. I had been getting the pain since the day 1.

"The shoes themselves are very good. The sizes are awful (hence the 3 stars). I checked the size to another nike shoes that I had and fit right, so I ordered that size. It did not fit at all, so I had to return the first one and go 2 sizes bigger. Even after that, they are a bit tight. It is really hard to figure out which to order.
These have a thicker build to them, and the sizing seemed to be measured on the outside. So the inside of the shoe is smaller and won't fit right.
If the shoe fits though, it's comfortable and looks nice, so I don't feel like I wasted my money.",3,0,8.0

Although none of my friends asked if I was fast when they saw them they did say I looked cool (may have just been because of the new bracelet my sister made me).

Ordered half a size more than I normally wear. nike shoes are usually rather tight. space on the side as well as in length. Stability good. comfortable running and jogging.,4,1,18.0
" They’re nice, light weight. They messed my shoe box up in transit though",4,1,18.0
"I wear size 11 dress shoes and for 30+ years have purchased Nike running shoes one size larger. My size 12 shoes in this model fit very well. But in this particular model, I could go a half-size larger (but half-sizes stop at 12). So, I'm happy, but must wear thin socks. Note: I do remove Nike's sole insert and put one in that's for those who want arch support. But my insert is quite thin and I'd still go with a 12.5 if Nike made it. My width is 11EE:E, so I like the more abundant width of this model.

Very comfortable every-step landing on this shoe on the 4+ mile 4+ MPH walks with my wife. Cushioned landings. Slight space at toe rather than bottom sole extending to the full tip toe - this makes for an encouraged step forward.

One minor downside is the slightly heavier weight, but nowhere near Nike Monarchs anchors. The upside to the weight is I've found Nike shoes over the years that are heavier actually last longer. I'm talking 7-10 years.

Fantastic running shoe for general purpose workouts.",5,1,18.0
"Bought these as a nice pair to workout in, so I didn’t expect much...But this is Nike we’re talking about! Since these shoes even fit better than some running shoes that I’ve tried, I’ve started to wear these with regular outfits. Very glad that I gave these a shot.",5,1,18.0

"I own another pair of Nike's Air Max. Very high quality and very comfortable shoes. This one though didn't fit me and is very small, although it's the same size US 10.

"After literally walking holes in the bottom of the Nike shoes I received less than a year ago, I was somewhat concerned about buying the Nike brand again. Ultimately, I had heard great things about the Air Max line and, with the price being so affordable, I felt I needed to give my favorite brand another try. So glad that I did! These came quickly and fit perfectly. I've only had them for about 2 weeks but have already walked over 20 miles, worked out aggressively 6 or 7 times, played baseball and basketball and they still look and feel brand new! I am very impressed so far. Time will tell but these, so far, have exceeded my expectations.",5,1,18.0

I needed a black stylish shoe for work. this one fit the bill. very comfortable for a 12 hr shift. however watch out for water; dont know if its because its new but its a little slippery when it comes to water.

"Much prefer these over the Air Max 95, except you cannot get these 200’s in all-leather.

They’re very bouncy and comfy. Standard laces and tongue (unlike 95). Feel more sturdy and give better support than the Air Max Plus. They fit wider feet (unlike 95’s). Although fabric they feel fairly warm on the foot. Yet lightweight.

The small bit of faux leather at the front might take some wear; not sure they’ll stand up to mucking about and kicking a ball etc. Be fine for a gentle jog.

I’d buy these again if they can as all leather.",4,1,18.0

"I had a vintage pair of Nikes from 2007 that finally gave out so I thought I'd buy another similar pair. Sure they are lightweight but, that is because Nike has skimped on material.

Have gotten a lot of compliments wearing them from friends asking me where I got them and if I can get them some too. These shoes are easy to clean and last a real long time and still going strong. These look great for both men and women. I will keep buying these in the future. Highly recommend.,5,1,18.0
Great looking shoe. Immediate compliments. Was a little worried by the reviews and was half expecting fakes but they seem legit to me. For the price I paid they better be! A little snug for us wide foots but not too much. Also the insoles a little stiff but I can still walk comfortably in them and would def recommend. Will be back to update on endurance over time.,4,1,18.0

"I purchased these shoes and my excitement was quickly turned to disappointment. When spending you know $100+ on a new pair of shoes, you expect the shoes to be you know, new. They were shipped shortly after purchasing, and arrived in a timely manner, that was great. What wasn’t great, was taking them out of the package and getting ready to wear them, and upon initial inspection seeing that the shoes looked worn, had scuff marks, minor creasing, smudges, scratches and some weird red stuff on the top of the toes. I’m pretty disappointed and very unsatisfied with that.",3,0,18.0

I sent them back and bought two new pairs for the price of the airmax and they are way more comfortable!",1,0,18.0

Ok these shoes look just like the pic.. I wear a size 11 in asics. Only shoes i hv worn in the past 10 yrs. anyways these nikes are a little narrow. So if they hv a size m. I would recomend. Also these shoes are going to take some time breaking in. Very very stiff shoe. Ince they are broke in im shure ivwill love them. I wore first day all over chicago. Yea my feet were killing me. Not from walking just from shoe being so stiff. I hv decided winter is not a good tym to break these leather shoes in. Over all this is a very nice shoe,4,1,18.0

"I decided to pickup some legendary Nike Air Max and I've not been disappointed. These are well made, a good size and feel premium on my feet.

Pros
Well made
Nice material
Good cusioning
No blisters.
Look awesome

Cons
Can't think of any

Overall these are as expected and well worth the purchase.",5,1,18.0
"I have wider than 'average' feet, so that rules me out of all Adidas products, Reebok used to be ok in the 90's but they changed their 'Last' (which is the foot shape that the designs are based on) for something narrower and sadly none will fit now. If you go up a size it helps for width but then you get clown shoes with a huge gap from the toe to the end of the shoe which make them impossible to drive in.
Nike have always been a good fit, since the mid 90's I have always stayed with Nike but this shoe crippled me! So much narrower than any I have tried on, but I thought it might have been just tight leather and they would break in. Sadly not but now too late to return, my advice is if they don't feel right as soon as you put them on, send them back.",5,1,18.0
I have these is more of a fabric in a few colours but theses come up massive in the same size compared to my others. Worn a few times so I can’t send them back which I should have. They will be in the cupboard until I can bare to give them away as only wore a few times.,5,1,18.0
"No complaints on the shoe, its exactly as the description. My only qualm is that delivery was crap as it never arrived and i had to hunt it down",3,0,18.0
This was the Nike shoe box inside the packaging as this was a Xmas present I am not impressed what kind of company sends this to a customer also one trainer had dirty marks on it that I had to clean if this wasn’t for a Xmas present they would have been on a plane back to Germany looks like they came from a Nike clearance shop will give this company a miss in the future.,3,0,18.0
My son was advised by podiatrist to buy trainers with a good heel and strong back and sides due to foot problems low arches and flat feet. Our local shop did not have them in size 10.5 so had to search the internet. The services was great and the product genuine and good quality. He is walking better with less discomfort.,4,1,18.0

"Great sneaker. Very comfortable, lightweight and great for being on your feet all day. Practically feels like you're just wearing socks on the top and sides of your foot and the foam in the sole is very supportive and cushy. Looks even better when you're wearing them than it does without a foot inside in the product photos. I bought a pair for myself for an all day, early morning to late evening event which required me to walk and stand the entire day, and amazingly, my feet didn't hurt at all at the end of the day or the next day. They're now my everyday shoe and they're so comfy that I bought this pair in a different colorway for my boyfriend who is on his feet all day at work.",5,1,18.0
"Have gout and a somewhat flat foot. I also do not like when my toe jams into the rubber part of the front of all other shoes I have. I have really nice Asics Gel Kayanos and would have sworn they were the most comfortable shoes. The only issue is the support around the front sometimes cramps my toes in. When I put these Nike Tanjuns on, I discovered the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. The entire front of the shoe is loose fabric and the sole is a flat memory foam material. Feels like I am wearing a super comfortable sock. I have now purchased 5 pairs of these shoes in different colors. I am the type of person who will buy as many of something as I can if I am worried the style or feel will change in the future. That being said, I will wear my Asics for extreme sporting activities and the Tanjuns for everything else.",5,1,18.0
"Ordered a Nike, got a ??? Cheap foam insert does not even go to the end of the shoe. The Nike symbol is not there at all. Poorly made in China. Thank goodness we used amazon prime and will be returning it today.",1,0,18.0
"I have purchased many pairs of sneakers over the years, but the Nike Tanjun Running Sneaker literally has been the only pair I've owned that has checked all the boxes. They are light weight, super comfortable, stylish, durable, and fit perfectly. I have worn them almost daily for months now and they still look as good as the day I bought them. I highly recommend these sneakers!",5,1,18.0
"I've done and am still doing research on shoes. I have plantar fasciitis and need a cushioned shoe. This is definitely not it. I'm not sure what's going on with the reviews and/or the claims by the company, but these shoes have a cheap 2mm foam insert on top of an extremely hard outsole. This thing does not give at all. I tried these shoes on for 15 minutes and couldn't stand the pain.

These may be great for stability, I don't know. They're definitely not comfortable or cushioned at all.",1,0,18.0
"It's a quality shoe, I'll give it that. Can't go wrong with Nike, but it's not as comfortable as I was hoping from reviews. I stand and walk on hard concrete floors 9 hours a day, very little relaxing. By the end of my day my knees are killing me, and my feet ache. Well, my old shoes were ok for that, made a heck of a difference with dr shoals insoles. But these shoes don't feel any better, they might actually be a bit more uncomfortable at days end. The white sole is also filthy after only a week walking around, so not the best for a dirty environment, but what shoe is...
At least their new and free of holes.😊",3,0,18.0
I work 80 hours a week. I am going to put these shoes to the test. This is my second pair and I must say these shoes can take a beating. I have foot problems but these shoes help with the pain. I stay on my feet all day and I recommend them Comfortable and lightweight.,5,1,18.0
Extremely lightweight and breathable sneakers. Very comfortable. They do need to be broken in by wear but that doesn't take long at all. Size ran normal for me also. Great sneakers.,5,1,18.0
Really comfortable. Lightweight too. Really nothing wrong with them from what i can tell,5,1,18.0
"I’ve been wearing these shoes very regularly for about 14 months. Here’s the short:

Pros: These are pretty comfortable and good if you’re on your feet all day and want shoes that can assist in delaying heel pain.

Cons: The tread is GONE. I’ve found myself slipping and sliding for a few months to the point that it’s time to retire these permanently. I’d keep wearing if the tread lasted longer, but it just hasn’t help up even to relatively light use after one year.

Conclusion: Worth it, but look for a sale, because they probably won’t last as long as you’d like.",4,1,18.0
"I ordered a pair of these size 8 wide. What came were a used pair, size 8. The box wasn’t new and said size 8. The person who put stickers on the box covering where it’s marked size 8 with stickers that say say size 8 wide. The sneakers I paid for were supposed to be brand new. They weren’t. The left sneaker was incorrectly relaced. The bottom of the sneaker was worn down. For the money I paid I expect, no I demand brand new, quality product, not sneakily refurbished trash.",1,0,18.0
"These shoes do not hold up, I wore through the tread in 3 weeks. The cushion has broken down and they are uncomfortable to walk in now. If you walk on a wet surface use caution.",1,0,18.0
"If you need to get new tennis shoes I can not recommend this pair enough. They are my favorite sneaker of all time. I'm seriously debating if I should get another 'back up' pair in case Nike stops making them down the road so I will have another pair when I wear these out. I got them bc I have to start wearing some custom orthotics daily due to collapsed arches and I liked these b/c you can 'dress' them up a little bit for sneakers. But they are so light, breathable and like walking on a very supportive cloud if that makes sense. The mesh is flexible so it will accommodate bunions too if you have them (they stretch out for my orthotics nicely). I show up for happy hours in them and ppl say outfits are 'cute' so they really do the dress up role nicely. I'm so happy with them. I got a men's size - I'm a 9 in women's and ordered an 8 men's and they fit perfect.",5,1,18.0
The shoes are fine but the fact that they were already worn was upsetting. See photos. The bottoms are obviously worn and dirty. Not sure how they passed any product inspections at Amazon. Box was very damaged as well.,1,0,18.0
"I seem to have problems with my feet and with heart issues was asked by my doctor to walk every day. Bought the Royal Blue first pair of Nike. After having tried 3 to 4 different brands and not being satisfied bought my second White and by 3rd Black pair. The shoe feels very comfortable in the toes and on my heels as well, can walk for an extended amount of time with no pain no issues. Trust me these are the most comfortable pair of walking shoes I have had. If you look for comfort you will pick these.",5,1,18.0
I've owned Nike shoes in the past but for some reason these shoes are just okay. I really can't put my finger on it but something just seems to be off pudding about these certain shoes. I guess over all they're okay but they just seem to have a cheap feel to them and they don't seem to fit as well as other Nike shoes I've owned. In closing all I can really say is if you're buying a pair of Nike shoes don't go cheap just lay out some cash and give your feet a true treat.,3,0,18.0
"I have flat feet, and finding a comfortable walking/running shoe is extremely difficult. My job requires a LOT of walking several hours a day, and these feel like I’m wearing socks! Incredibly soft and comfortable, and I can walk all day in my flat feet. I was so impressed with these that after just 3 days I ordered another pair in a different color.

If you have flat feet like me, you will absolutely LOVE these!",5,1,18.0
"When I first put these on they were a bit tight but figured they'd stretch a bit. They did not, while they were ok in the toe area, the width was very snug. My main issue with the shoe was that for all the apparent cushioning, there is actually very little once you put them on. It is a very, very firm shoe with little to no arch support, I could feel myself standing on my heals.

The mesh of the upper is very nice and does ventilate well. If you will be doing a reasonable amount of standing or walking, these are not the shoes to wear. I wear a standard width size 10 for the last 30+ years, these are on the snug side.",2,0,18.0
"I have ankle pain from standing for 24+ hours in the ICU rounding (also have excessive eversion of my feet and some peroneal tendonitis from a tennis injury). I had tried compression socks and wearing an AFO brace to help. These helped some but since switching to these shoes 2 months ago...my pain is practically gone. I probably just needed to replace my older new balances (worn for 12 months) but still....very happy with this shoe thus far. Light weight, breathable, and not too expensive. Im in the NICU so unlikely to get major spills so I didn't really care about water resistance.",5,1,18.0
These are the most comfortable sneakers I've ever worn. I've worn plenty of Asics and even Brooks shoes because I figured a great running shoe would be a great walking shoe but it turns out I was wrong. These are the best walking shoes I've ever worn. The mesh is extra breathable so your feet stay dryer and the shoes won't smell bad as quickly. The cushion provided by these shoes is fantastic. I think there is something to the flat bottom shoes because Asics always have a recess on the bottom so your heel won't hit the ground. I think this actually causes my ankle to pronate and is generally a less comfortable design. It's also worth noting that I have a slightly wide and flatter foot and these are still a great fit. Overall great pair of shoes and I'd highly recommend them.,5,1,18.0
"I have NO idea how it got so many 5 stars. Probably from sponsors, paid people or amateur sneakerheads. The quality is of a sweat factory that costs $1.50 for sale to make. It's an absolute rip off and the gums are too high. Go to the mall and buy a better quality pair. Not even the outlets have it this bad. Clearance product.",1,0,18.0
"These were kind of narrow and hurt my feet until like the 6th time I wore them... Then again I have wide feet, so that could be part of the issue.
Also the toe started separating from the front of the shoe like the 4th time I wore them,, so I was not happy about that.. Bought nikes before in the past, and never had the issue.
Love the all black tho!!",5,1,18.0
"Last year I ordered these exact same sneakers. The fit and comfort was perfect. I loved them and, therefore, I ordered another pair this summer. I was disappointed with the new pair. The new pair is smaller and tighter although it is the exact same size, 9.5, as the older ones. What I noticed on the label is that last year's pair was made in Indonesia. This year's pair is made in Vietnam. Nike's specs shrunk in the process. If in doubt, order larger.",3,0,18.0
"I love these for running and day to day wear. So comfy, I love the sleek minimalist style, no gawdy colors or design, and they breathe! I plan on buying more (colors) of these as long as Nike makes them. $70 feels a little steep for how light these are, but hey... It's Nike. Only downside is that the material is tough to clean, so maybe avoid white.",5,1,18.0
"I spend long hours on my feet and was in constant pain with my old shoes, despite the fact that they had claimed to be good for just those sort of conditions. After two months of wearing these ones, I have no pain at all. When I first put them on, they felt great, but I still had the residual pain from before, so I couldn't really tell how these would pan out. It took a while for my feet to heal but now all the pain in my arches and toes is gone, so I would highly recommend these to anyone suffering from foot pain due to long hours of standing and walking and also to anyone who has to work under those conditions and wants to avoid pain. Plus they look great. (I got the blue ones.)",5,1,18.0
"Bad photo but yeah I love these, all I buy is Nike really, I really really wish they were like the Nike Roshe, I thought they were the same thing but the netting is not as breathable(still breathable though) and the insole is a part of the shoe also not as nice as the Roshe. But overall the shoe is nicer.",5,1,18.0
"I bought this shoe because it was listed as one of the top shoes to buy for people on their feet all day, plus some of the reviews here said it's a great shoe for that purpose. I work in a warehouse, ten hour shifts. I spent a lot of money, expecting that these shoes would deliver. By the time I get home from work every day, I can barely walk anymore, so I was hoping to find a pair of shoes that would alleviate my foot pain. I wore these the first day and was disappointed that they did not deliver like so many other people said. After only a few hours on my feet, I was back to being in pain and found no difference from wearing these shoes than any other shoe.",2,0,18.0
"This shoe is my second choice in footwear. Payless Shoe Store, now closed, had great, inexpensive mesh shoes. After they closed, I was adrift trying to find comfortable shoes that really fit. Even buying in shoe stores did not work. I wasted a lot of money. Fortunately, I discovered Tanjun Nike Mesh Shoes. They fit right size and are comfortable. I hope they stay in production.",4,1,18.0
"I’m a painting contractor and on my feet all day, so when I googled top 10 most comfortable shoes, these were #1 with Adidas cloudfoam ultimate #2 (or visa versa). Then I found these here on AMZN, and after reading all the excellent reviews about them, I decided to purchase. Well, I wear a size 11, so I ordered a pair of cloudfoam ultimates and a pair of these in my size, but these are too short. My big toe is about to bust through the fabric when walking around my house for 5 min. So I’m returning and because they don’t have an 11-1/2 available in the color I want, I purchased another pair of cloudfoam ultimates. With that being said, these shoes are extremely comfortable and lightweight. Almost can’t even tell I’m wearing shoes. If they had a half size larger, I would have exchanged for a pair that fit.",4,1,18.0
"The shoe was white and black and quality doesn't seem good, no point in returning it as there is no guarantee I will get a different one.",1,0,18.0
"I expected $60 Nike brand shoes to last longer than 2 months. Just after the return window closed, a huge hole appeared in the toe. These shoes were worn for every day walking around, not for sports or anything rough. I’d give 0 stars if I could. DISAPPOINTED!",1,0,18.0
"IMO this is Nike's best running shoe, if not their best shoe they made ever. It's comfortable, lightweight, and smooth which is what I look for in a shoe. It is almost the perfect shoe ever, except for one thing. It will not protect your feet from getting wet in the rain or snow. This shoe is much better in the gym or warm weather, but if that doesn't faze you, like it didn't faze me, than get this shoe.",5,1,18.0
"These are nice shoes! I will say from past experience, that Nike shoe sizes do run small. I normally wear a 10 1/2, but with Nike I wear an 11 1/2. I bought 11 1/2 and they fit perfectly and they are very comfortable. Hard to find basic black and white shoes anymore. Everything is either neon orange or some other crazy color. I do recommend these shoes though. Just be carefull about the size you order.",5,1,18.0
"The shoes I purchased were marketed and bought under the label and description that they were men’s shoes. I got them and jammed them on my feet and they’ve crushed my feet. At first I thought I just needed to break them in but realized they are not men’s as I had been promised as those I purchased. I have 3 pair of these in men’s and they are as comfortable as anything so I knew something wasn’t right. I would like my money back please and/or possible, they be replaced with a size 10.5 men’s version of these sneakers. Very upsetting.",1,0,18.0
"So, I had actually bought the same pair of shoes 4 years back. They lasted me 3 years and were perfect for everything, from working at my warehouse job, to hiking, and running. Can't wait for these pair to last me a while as well. These are very comfortable and durable shoes, highly recommend these to anyone looking for THAT shoe, this is THE ONE. Whether it be, casual wear, sport, work, this is your GO TO shoe. Looking forward to making more memories with these pair of shoes.",5,1,18.0
"Bought a pair of these shoes earlier this year. I've worn them almost daily for months now and have never liked a pair of shoes better. Lightweight yet sturdy and fairly good looking. I had to purchase a backup pair, because I know I'll wear my current pair out someday.",5,1,18.0
"My new favorite pair of shoes. Got these for 55 on Friday and they were at my door on Sunday. I'm pretty sure these are the casual/walking shoes I'll be wearing from now on. I'll save my Air Force Ones for those special occasions. They also give you a good amount of lift. Super clean black, I'm just hoping I don't get the white part dirty too quickly",5,1,18.0

"I absolutely love these shoes. Man are they comfortable. Probably the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. This was the second pair I bought. BUT I keep having the same issues with them. After 3-4 months a hole always appears in the area where my big toes are. I saw another review just now talking about the same thing. I got them for $40 and I see they’ve gone up to almost $100. I didn’t mind buying a second pair because of the price, but for $100 I would never. Not for the poor quality.",3,0,18.0
Do not buy this garbage! It last 3 months. Then the front top starts to rip up! Very not lasting material. DON’T waste your money,1,0,18.0
My son loves these shoes. He’s a young boy so he is constantly growing. And he likes to run and play basketball. He wears out a pair of shoes pretty fast. He has had 3 pairs of this exact shoe for the last two years. We did change shoes once for another pair of Nikes but he ended up with heel pain and some mild plantar fasciitis. We stopped wearing those shoes and went back to these. He now has no foot pain. This seems to be a great shoe that supports the heels and arches.,5,1,18.0
Tanjun are the worst sneaker so far in Nike history in my household . Bought them july 11th and they are in the trash already. Poorly made wore out the tread already plus the side of the shoe material got a stretched shredded spot in the material . Not the toe part in the ankle area. Money wasted.,1,0,18.0

"Never been a Nike shoe fan but wanted to give these shoes a try since its on Google's Top 10 most comfortable shoes list and voted #2. Wanted something comfortable to wear for work since my job requires more than half of my day standing and walking around. I'd say these are nice to wear but #2 most comfortable shoes, nahh! Find something else. They look nice though, thats a plus.",4,1,18.0
"I have a big foot (size 11 women's shoe). I purchased the black pair in a men's size 10, they are alittle bit wider in the toe area whereas a women's shoe fits tight and a wide is too wide. Very comfortable so I found these online and ordered them in white.",5,1,18.0

"I almost never bother to leave reviews, but these were good enough for me to write one. I have very flat feet, and need a lot of arch support, so I have been a repeat Nike customer for many years now. I often get knee and/or foot pain from formal shoes, so I was also looking for running shoes that look nice enough to be acceptable in a business casual office environment. These fit the bill perfectly on both counts.

Bonus for being the lightest sneakers I have ever bought.",5,1,18.0
"These shoes were great and very comfortable, however they only lasted 5 months before a hole appeared in the top of the shoe. Additionally, the netting at the front of the shoe began to come loose from the rubber sole at the tip of the shoe. Pretty disappointing, as these shoes are very lightweight and comfortable.

"They are so light, it feels like wearing a pair of socks. Very comfortable; the look good enough to be able to wear with business casual clothing.

I'm really disappointed with the quality that amazon is supporting. I got this pair of shoes in january 2018. The net of the shoes was torn in 2 months !!! I gave this product another chance in october 2018 by purchasing again since I thought that product must somehow be old and maybe I'd be at fault and hence the wear and tear. The second pair literally tore in January again!!! I'm extremely disappointed with either very cheap quality products unintentionally getting mixed with the good lot or an intentional manifestation of extremely poor quality products under high prices distributed by amazon.,1,0,18.0

"I love this shoe! I ordered as a gift for my really tall grown son for Christmas. I know he’s going to love them! He has lots of Nike sneakers already. I had never seen any like these. It was the last pair in his size. They are currently unavailable. So glad I was able to order these!

My dilemma:
Some how my sister in law’s address was saved as our default address. She lives in Texas and we live in the DMV (DC, Maryland, Virginia) area. So... the shoes were going to her house. I realized this when I looked back over my order and saw the address. I immediately contacted the seller and was told it was too late to make changes. I wasn’t very happy with that answer because, the tracking showed that it had not shipped. I wanted the shoes, I didn’t want to cancel. I couldn’t cancel anyway because it was in the process of getting ready to be shipped.
Well, to make a long story short. They fixed it for me! The shoes were delivered to me . I was surprised and thrilled to see that box! I felt like I had just received a Christmas gift! They even changed it to priority shipping and included a hand written note. They did right by me and I am very grateful! They went above to satisfy a customer. Thank you guys!!!! Merry Christmas!",5,1,18.0

"Wanted sturdy pair of Nikes. Good value, really like the fit. Bought these because I had a very similar pair years ago which really lasted, I usually wear out other brand trainers within a couple of months, but these will last a lot longer. Got them for regular use and wear both while exercising and just day to day footwear. Great buy. I had wondered if I’d prefer other pairs that were twice the price, but when they arrived and I put them on no regrets at all... thrilled with the value and they’re quality. Probably buy the same ones again, though may be a while before I wear these ones out. The leather is really sturdy so can imagine some people finding they need to wear them in a little around the backs",5,1,18.0

"Is there less than a star I could give to this product and especially the Seller GoodSports Outdoor ?
After 3 months of using these shoes in the office and occasionally walking session at nights, the sole cracked open. That is because the exterior rubber sole layer is so thin that there is no way not to quickly get to the air cushion sole, behind the rubber sole. I contacted GoodSports Outdoor and they said I used the too much (in 3 months). The interesting thing is that Amazon knew this was bad product since they kept the option to return this item, after 3 months from purchase.
So, I got my money back form Amazon, but, GoodSports Outdoor refused to consider replacement or refund.
I will never buy, nor I recommend GoodSports Outdoor to anyone. They don't stand by their products.
See attached din the picture how thin is the rubber layer.",1,0,18.0
The first 2 months this shoe was amazing. I felt like I was walking on clouds. I rarely used them in the beginning but once I started really using them the third month I noticed the squeaked constantly and I didn’t know why. After awhile I noticed my right lower back started hurting I thought it was because of maybe the way I sat down? Or from working out. BUT after reading some of these reviews it’s because the right side shoe popped and my balance was off when I walked! Once I bought some different shoes the pain stopped. I paid almost $200 for these shoes and they didn’t even make it over 5 months of really minimal use. I will NEVER EVER buy another pair of these shoes again and will be contacting someone about the poor quality. Only reason I gave it a 2 was because the look cool even if they did screw up my back.,2,0,18.0

Sneakers came and looked nice when they came but when I took them out and looked at them I notice a mark in the air bubble at first thought it was glue or something but it wouldn't rub off thought it was a crack but air does not leak out you pay a price like this for sneakers you expect them to be perfect,2,0,18.0
"The shoe looks great, fits great, but after the break in period shoe material begins to squeeze and shift while walking. I no longer run in them in fear of rolling my ankle. It looks nice but i feel it is no longer safe to long distance run in. Of course these defects show up after I'm able to return them so I'm stuck with a $200+ walking shoe. Some may pay these prices for fashion but I only took a chance and paid this price for the results advertised.",2,0,18.0
"I have always been a big fan of the Nike air max, I bought these 5 months ago and for 3 months of that I had knee surgery so couldn't even wear them between being bed ridden and crutches. So I've essentially wore the shoes for 2 months and the air pocket on them had a leak so I literally had a flat tire. These are the most comfortable shoes ever until you get a flat tire. For paying over 100 bucks for a pair of shoes you think you should get a lot more out of them. I bet they wouldn't of lasted a week if I was a runner. It is possible that I got a lemon pair and hopefully that's the case.",2,0,18.0

"Pros: Lightweight, comfortable, great fit, and most importantly they are amazingly breathable.

Cons: You will get rocks stuck in your shoe. The only safe place to run with these is indoor tracks or treadmills.
My image above is after a 3 mile run on a path the changed from pavement to gravel. The worst part, are the thin cracks that are super hard to cleanout.

Do not buy unless you only plan to use these indoors.",3,0,28.0
"Lightest, most-comfortable Nikes ever. I use these for casual wear; so I can’t speak as to how they would hold up for running. But for casual wear, they’re great! Especially for warmer temps. Full disclosure: This is my second pair (my first pair was from another retailer) and the only reason I hesitated this long to purchase another is that the first pair squeak while walking, depending on the floor surface (certain types of tile/linoleum/floor wax?). No problem with this pair thankfully though, oddly enough. Thought I should at least mention it as a possibility though. Overall, great shoes—love these even over the 2018 version.
Update (Oct 2019): This pair began to squeak shortly after purchase while walking too. I'm starting to believe it's just an (unacceptable) design flaw. Took off two stars for the squeaking while walking (it's that bad). Ended up purchasing a pair of New Balance 990v5's instead-- no squeaking while walking, AND better arch support (admittedly with inserts provided by 'Lucky Feet' shoe store)!

I always review with information that I feel others would like to know about the product as I always assume what I'm writing will influence for or against the purchase. I always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality, value and application. Most importantly, I will always end the review with an answer as to whether I'd purchase the product again which I believe is the most critical question pertaining to the item. To manufacturers: Want me to review your items, just let me know!

I haven't been able to find my old Nike Flyknit shoes here on Amazon and have been on the hunt for fashionable, functional and light weight tennis/running shoes. When I go cheaper, I'm nearly always disappointed. After a lot of searching I landed on these. As is usually the case, some of the colors I want are out of stock in my size so I got the black/white combination, which is really more gray ... what I was looking for.

They are very light, almost a mesh material and fit perfectly. Looks-wise, they were very close to what I was looking for and I'm really pleased with how light they are and how well they fit. I'm not a runner (bad knees) but wanted something versatile to where for walking or just casually going out. Some have reported rocks getting stuck in the tread holes but I haven't had that issue myself.

Hearing that Nike is pulling out of Amazon, I'm inclined to purchase another set of these shoes but figured other resellers would sell through Amazon. Regardless, really happy with the look and functionality of these shoes. Exactly what I was looking for. A bit on the more expensive side but I've learned I have to get north of $100 to get the shoes that fit my desires.

Would definitely purchase these again!",5,1,28.0
"These shoes had been worn and returned by someone before I got them. Probably returned because of the incessant squeaking. But they are very, very comfortable and I will try buying another pair. Hopefully they will not have been worn and won't squeak!

OK, ordered a second pair hoping they had not been previously worn and didn’t squeak. Received them in two days from ordering. They had NOT even worn previously which is a plus. And they are very comfortable. However, and the reason I only gave them four stars is they are still very noisy. Squishing and squeaking with every step. You could not refer to these shoes as sneakers because you would never be able to sneak up on anyone with all the racket they make! But I love them anyway.",4,1,28.0
"I loved this shoe. I had gotten a pair of Free Runs a couple years back and needed another,so I got this pair and the tongue ripped 2 months in. They were extremely comfortable and I did everything I could to baby them. I would wipe them down after every use and sit in from of a fan to air dry. Never used more than 2 hours at a time and never gotten wet. Then one day I decide to slip them on and ***RIIIIIPPPPP*** the tail got ripped in half. A design flaw in an otherwise great shoe.",2,0,28.0
"Look these sneakers.
Exactly what i wanted got 2 pairs..",4,1,28.0
The shoes are very comfortable but I am upset about the 25 dollar increase on price when I returned the 9 and ordered the 9.5. To go from 113.00 to 137.00 seems like highway robbery. Also do not use these shoes on a small rock surface. The rocks get caught in the sole of the shoe.,4,1,28.0
"Got these for my son who has flat feet and is prone to foot pain if shoes are tight around the tendon at the back of his foot. These shoes are really light and the back are very flexible, so they are comfortable enough for him to stand at work all day. I've bought the women's version for my daughter who is in nursing with the same results. Fantastic shoes!",5,1,28.0
"Shoes look and fit right, however the bottom of the shoes is shapes so that small rocks and pebbles always gets stuck in them and while running you can feel these rocks and pebbles. I take them out, and they refill (see photo). Not a good design at all, otherwise the shoe is okay. I have an older pair of flynit nike shoes, and those were much better overall design.",1,0,28.0
"Shoes were fine. Fabric wasn’t what I expected, not through deception, just hard to see on the screen. I sent back for a refund unworn. $76 “restocking fee�? Thanks, that’s not how good companies operate. No one should do business like that, and I will be filling out reviews here and all the applicable other sites.",1,0,28.0
"I wished Nike had not discontinued this model, they don’t have any thing to replace it :)",4,1,28.0
"I bought these shoes specifically for travelling. I like to run while I am on the road for work and needed a pair that were both comfortable to run with, but also lightweight and most importantly could be squished down very flat for easy carry-on packing. I have been very happy so far with these shoes. They are pretty stylish, very comfortable to run in, and most importantly extremely light and compact.",5,1,28.0
Right Now I Was Looking At The Way it was made closely and I have To Give Them a Highly Accurately Detailed Bottom Sole Excellent Comfort!,5,1,28.0
I bought these for light jogging/gym and casual wear. After a day of break in these feel like socks on your feet. They fit true to size and feel supportive. Mind you im not running a marathon in these but for straight jogs on a road or track these are more than adequate. Bought a second pair and a few other colors I liked them so much.,5,1,28.0
Best shoes on the planet. Nike sucks for changing the style. I hate the new model.,5,1,28.0
"Hawt Dawg, these are good. I wear them to the gym. I wear them running. I wear them to your moms house. What more can you ask for?",5,1,28.0
"These a super light and very comfortable shoes. I normally wear an 11, but like other similar Nike shoes I wear an 11.5, and these were the same. Fit great, feel great, my new favorite casual shoe.",5,1,28.0
"I bought these shoes for my boyfriend. We are always biking, running, lifting... you name it. He says that the shoes feel like slippers, they are light weight, and breathable. I would definitely buy them again!",5,1,28.0
"It seems like with these new models company tries to use less and less material for new sneakers, soon we will be attaching just a bottom part of the shoe to the foot and go for run with Nike label, Just Do it Bro!
LOL😆
But other than that all is perfect 👌",5,1,28.0
These are wonderful shoes very light and comfy. Seller was awesome they seem as legit as they can be I own like 5 pairs of these since they came out I just compare them. If anyone says these shoes rip it’s because you’re supposed to tie and untie them every time also don’t fall which is pretty hard these.,5,1,28.0
"This is the best sneaker Nike ever made, lightweight but with lots of support for walking. I wish they had more colors to choose from.",5,1,28.0
"I have feet that lived in military boots for many years and had developed bunions. Many shoes have become too uncomfortable to wear but these are the exception. The flyknit fabric is forgiving on pressure points, and when worn casually, the shoes last a long time.",5,1,28.0
"These are lightweight and good looking, but are completely lacking in support and treads for real runners. $125 is just too expensive for a indoor gym workout shoe.",1,0,28.0
The fit was true to size. I think the shoe is not up to Nike quality I have come to expect. I know this is a minimalist running shoe but it has very little side to side support. Just not a good workout shoe. It is fine for just kicking around and walking but lacks the kind of stability I expect from a serous running shoe.,3,0,28.0
"This is a very comfortable shoe, but it did not last long. The toe area where the fabric met the sole of the shoe came apart after the second month. It started with a little tear and then got worse. They need to reinforce this show with extra stitches.,Then it would be a great shoe",2,0,28.0
Going to return. This tennis shoes does not feel like an engineered Nike product. Feels cheap and uncomfortable.,2,0,28.0

Ive owned a few of these shoes and im so glad yall have them here since they’re a little hard to find because these shoes are from 2018. Thank you I’ll buy more before they run out,5,1,28.0
The perfect shoe for my flat feet. This is my second pair. Unfortunately Nike does not make them anymore. I am not a fan of the replacement Nike Free Runs. This version is for those who like the bear foot approach.,5,1,28.0
I buy a pair now and then when I can find them. These were the best designs Nike ever made for those of us in hot areas like Arizona.,5,1,28.0
"If you're looking for sneakers that fit like a glove, these are it. Nike should've never stopped making these! I bought another pair for backup because I love them so much. In my opinion, you should go a half size down to get that sock-like fit.",5,1,28.0
Every year my son-in-law asks me to get him a new pair. I guess he likes them!!,5,1,28.0
"I purchased these for my son. He likes them, says they are comfortable, and light. He wears them to workout. The sizing was correct.",5,1,28.0

This is a very good running shoe the material there constructed of allows ventilation to your feet so you don't sweat in the shoe. They're very light and super comfortable I paid about $110 for these during the Amazon sale.,5,1,28.0
"Feels great when exercising or just going around ‘running�?errands, no pun intended. If you’re new to FlyKnits try these! Cool color selection as always. Super super comfortable! A bit pricey but worth it.",5,1,28.0
"Nike shoes are running short. I tried many. At least 1/2 a size. I'm a 11 1/2 in a good running shoe so I had to get a size 12, this is why the toe box is a little wide but it will due for a every day shoe in a warm climate. This is not a running shoe.",4,1,28.0
"Been using Nike Frees for many years. These were great fit, comfortable, lightweight yet enough padding for shock absorption. The only reason I gave them a 4 star is because they squeak too much.",4,1,28.0
"True to size; very breathable; very comfortable. Provides a more natural run, so make sure you're used to running in a shoe with a minimal heel-toe drop before you try to rock and roll on a marathon.",5,1,28.0

Ok,5,1,28.0
"Overall, I love this shoe. It is lightweight, breathable, and great for running. However, one issue to be aware of: if walking on granite or small stones, they will get lodged in the sole, which is kind of a bummer. Also, it can be squeaky on certain surfaces.",4,1,28.0

I received a pair of used shoes instead of a brand new pain of 2018 free run fly knits. absolutely unacceptable. Beware of who you buy from.......I thought this was a nike purchase guess not.,1,0,28.0
Excellent shoes. Very light and comfortable while running. Highly recommend for runners,5,1,28.0
I thought I was buying a pair of shoes. Instead it seems these are now a political statement. I wish I had not purchased them.,1,0,28.0
"I bought these shoes directly from Nike. They are comfortable, relatively cool, and seem like they will last. The only big flaw is the soles: they pickup gravel every time I wear them outside, and it takes an awl to pry it all out. I bought them primarily to wear at my camp in Maine, and it turns out that pea gravel is a big part of our ecosystem here. Who knew? Now, every time I step into the camp I have to take them off or clear them of hitch hikers, lest I completely ruin our 50 year old pine floors. It a nuisance, but more than that it's a real disappointment in what otherwise would be a very good shoe. I imagine for indoor alone use they'd be fabulous, but I live in the world where stuff happens outdoors too. I can't imagine what Nike's designers were thinking.",3,0,28.0
"These sneakers are great, extremely light and have good support. The material looks to be very breathable and it fits snugly around my ankle and foot. The soles are flexible and have great traction.",5,1,28.0
"So far so good. I have run 40 miles in these, I use them exclusively for running, on asphalt pavement, and I like them a lot. They have a good feel on the road. I am a forefoot striker (except when I am tired :) and I am not sure they would do as well for a heel-striker. To me, they feel like they are designed for the forefoot.

Before these I was running in Nike Free Run 5.0s �?I loved those so much that I bought 6 pair when Nike phased them out. But these Free Rn Flyknits �?They make me get up and go.",5,1,28.0
"These sneakers have been my everyday shoes, and I have another pair I run in. They have served me well in both capacities. Super comfortable, extremely breathable and cool, but still well supported. Only drawbacks are that the material is so breathable that if you get them wet, you are instantly soaked through to the socks, so not great for running after or during rain. Rocks also get stuck in the tread of the shoe every so often, but this never bothered me much.",5,1,28.0
"I use these shoes for everything that I do rock climbing, mountain biking, longboarding, hiking and just everyday use and I can confidently say these are the lightest most comfortable most breathable shoes I've ever worn.. I'm on my second pair going to get my 3rd they last about a year to year and a half of really rough wearing",5,1,28.0
I'm not a brand fanboi of any brand. I bought these at the Nike outlet in Boston in 2018. It's 2020 now. I've probably ran about 1000 miles in them and hiked several mountains and rugged trails with my dog over 2 years. They're in amazing shape still. I'm on Amazon right now to buy 2 more pairs like Elaine stockpiling sponges.,5,1,28.0
"This nike shoe is just brilliant. I am buying this for the second time, black with anthracite color goes well with every occasion, active or casual with jeans/shorts blue black whatever. Love this shoe, I ran extensively averaging about 50miles a week for about 10 months. The shoe is still in good shape but I bought another one before it gets discontinued.",5,1,28.0

"My son got a pair of these in 2018 and hung onto them a year and they were worn on the soles. The fabric is sturdier than it looks, no problem with wear to the fabric and they washed up well in the washing machine. Then, he replaced them recently with a hard soled Nike with carbon inset which was absolutely horrible. He is athletic and jogged 5 miles wearing the new shoes and wound up having to go to urgent care since he couldn't put weight one the foot and bruised the base of the foot. Those shoes went back to Nike and we bought another pair of these shoes. They are very light and the sole is flexible.",5,1,28.0
"Wear this shoe all the time and over a year later. Still has everything in tact with no fraying of any sort. Easy to clean. Very very comfortable. I usually wear a 9.5 but got a 9 thinking it would run big. It does not. Buy what size you normally buy! I got a half size too small and it’s pretty tight. My feet fit okay because it’s nice and stretchy for that, but definitely tighter than I anticipated. Get your “regular�?shoe size- don’t go to the smaller size of you fit kind of in between. Overall, could not be happier with them.",5,1,28.0
I love this shoe so much! I’m a woman’s 8.5 (but 9 in Nike bc they run small) and got a men’s 7.5 and it’s my favorite shoe ever!!! So cozy! It’s like I’m wearing a sock with arch support.,5,1,28.0
"These shoes fit like a glove. Perfect for running, walking and the rest. I have a lot of problems when I get ill-fitting shoes and at first I thought that these were too tight, but they are comfortable and so light. Couldn't be more pleased with them.",5,1,28.0

"I love the way the trainers look, and they are pretty breathable. But there is a rubber band on the heel, giving the heel structure, this rubs and inevitably led to blistering on both heels after only 2 miles of walking. The soles of the trainers also easily enable stones/rocks to get stuck in them which I had to remove with a sharp object countless times during my walk.",2,0,28.0
Great Nike free shoes. It’s a shame that Nike no longer produce these and new frees look very different,5,1,28.0
These were a gift for my son. He really likes them and says the fit like a glove and was actually very surprised that I bought the right size. His shoe size can vary between a 7 and an 8 so I took a guess and went for the 7.5 and they are a perfect fit.,5,1,28.0

Came quick. Shoes felt good after first few times. Noticed right exterior sole has come apart from shoe after about 6 miles of normal walking. Nike sign is worn off and inside tag is suspect of this show not actually being real. Size 12 but the left is more of a 13 and the right is a 11.,2,0,28.0

"This is my second pair of Nike Pegasus, the first pair lasted two years. I got these new ones two months ago and have yet to be able to walk in them without my feet hurting. It’s like there’s too much your feet sit too high in them and the right side squeezes your foot. I’ve worn the same size Nike shoes for 10+ years and have never had an issue. These things are $100+ that will just sit in the close until donated one day. I would suggest getting an older version of these or just something else period.",1,0,28.0

"I own the Nike Zoom Pegasus 37 BQ9646-011.
I had high hopes that this would finally be a shoe that was as good as my old Pegasus 30.

I'm an amateur runner that does races for fun and need a shoe that above all else will PROTECT ME. I don't need a shoe that is 10 micro grams lighter to that I can beat Eliud Kipchoge. I just need something that is strong, well cushioned and will protect my feet, knees and back from the rigors of long distance running.

Regarding this shoe: At first I tried it and felt a bit weird when running. It seems the support is more towards the middle of the shoe than on the heel. Then, as others have also reported, the shoe started causing me pain in the tendon right over my heels. The pain got worse and worse. So I had to stop using them. (And they're expensive)

Today I tried on my 8 year old Pegasus 30, and not only did they provide much better support, my feet felt much firmer. And the pain caused by the other shoes was not present, even though my tendon still feels tender. It's odd that a worn out shoe performed better and protects me better than this new model.

Nike if you're reading this: please go back to making excellent running shoes like the Pegasus 30. And stop doing the ""Apple"" thing and ruining a perfectly good performing shoe with versions like the 37. I'll happily buy a 30 again.. I just can't find one.",1,0,28.0
These are too loose a fit in the front/toe box; compared to the Air zoom Pegasus 35 running shoes I usually get in the same size; they are all great fitting shoes.,2,0,28.0
"I've been using my Vomero 14 Running shoes for 2 years now and they have not show any signs of damage etc. I've decided to take a chance on these Peg 37 as I was hoping to get the Peg 36 and I am not disappointed at all.

These shoes look good, are very comfortable and they fit my feet perfectly. I've only went for 2 short runs so far and I really do like the feel of them.

I will see how long they last, but I would definitely recommend the Peg 37.",5,1,28.0
I hated Nike for years. Great cushion and feel with these Peg 37’s. They’re pretty amazing. They will make your feet look longer because of the back sticks out. You will feel like a rooster or crow because of the back. Who cares.,5,1,28.0
Great runing shoes they supper light,5,1,28.0
"I have been wearing Nike Pegasus for running for the last 15-20 years. It has always been my go to option for comfort. The Pegasus 37 though seems to be a complete redesign which is actually killing my feet every time I wear them.

Nike Pegasus have always been suited to neutral attenuation feet but these don't seem to be. When running, or even just walking in them the tension causes pain in the arches of the feet.

Looking at the soles of the shoes there is a outer rim of dark rubber obviously designed to absorb pressure but even after wearing them just a few times I can see wear in the central hollow of the shoes. This means that the un-cushioned central area is the part coming into contact with the ground.

Another clear design floor is the back of the shoe which is lower than normal and tapered. I'm not sure why Nike felt the need to have a pointed end at the back of the shoe but it means the heel does not feel fully cushioned or supported and has a tendency to slip up and down.

I am really shocked at how badly designed these running shoes are and I can only advise others to avoid them like the plague.",5,1,28.0
"Like walking on marshmallows! I’ve rubbish feet (flat, thin heel and ball pads), these runners are a godsend for keeping me comfortable through the day. I use a standing desk and have been avoiding running because I’ve had bad luck with runners having soles that are too firm. Not these guys - these are supremely comfortable.",1,0,28.0
Recently taken up running through the Covid lock down and after a few weeks of running on an entry level Karrimor trainer I decided I needed to upgrade. Didn't want to spend a fortune so spent time reading reviews and decided upon these. I'm finding them really excellent and making a massive difference to any aches and pains I used to get after running. It feels like I'm running on air when I've got them on and definitely made the right choice. Amazon were the cheapest even compared to the Nike on-line store with discount. Delivery was excellent too. All in all I'm massively happy with these.,5,1,28.0
"My initial thoughts on this trainer was they were amazing. My son was comfortable from the get go.
Not even three months on and they've fallen apart. Yes he is a boy but he isn't rough on his things. His school shoes have lasted him all year as has his other branded trainer. Not worth the money.. Do not buy this product if you'd like them to last",4,1,28.0
"I did read the reviews on these and some can be a little off putting, I am a regular running about 25 miles a week.
I love these shoes, they are great, I tend to heal strike so can honestly say I think the design of these are great. I found these very comfortable right from the first run.
I can definitely recommend these shoes.",1,0,28.0
"They're the first running shoes I've ever bought and with all the great reviews I thought they'd be perfect. They're ok. They're very narrow, too narrow, wish there was more space as I'm going further and further with them and my feet are starting to swell now and I thought they'd be more cushioned, even over time. I think they're probably better for sprinting but not jogging. They look amazing though, I really like the design. I just think there's probably better running shoes out there, especially for the price.",5,1,28.0

"I wear Nike running shoe size 11 across the board. When I got these, I was afraid they were a half size too big. It turns out, the toe box is just a little larger than most Nike running shoes. I run about a 5k a day in these and they're great. Like running on plushy clouds.

As others have said, probably not the best marathon shoe but it's great for everyday runs and exercises",5,1,28.0

"They do run a little narrow, but my long runs have never felt more smooth. Lightweight, tons of energy return, and they breathe better than any shoe I've worn before. I've seen some complaints about blisters on heels, but I haven't experienced that yet, may just be related to the runners' footstrike. 4/5 though, considering getting another pair while they're in stock.",4,1,28.0

"I am starting to love these shoes. It's hard to describe how they feel, but I would say that when you're walking or running, they have a little bit of forward bounce to help you along. One thing you need to watch out for is driving. The holes get caught on my brake so that I'm hitting the gas and the brake. They are very slippery on the pedals. Otherwise, they are very comfortable, they look cool, and they're very light. Now we just have to see if they last!",5,1,28.0
I had ordered two pair... one months back where the sneaker seemed a little to snug and not enough room to put on. The inner sole could have a little more cushion... the next pair was a better fit... I made sure I ordered 1/2 size bigger,5,1,28.0
They say you get what you pay for... I’d have paid more. Surprisingly comfortable and felt good on my knees that have and surgery. I was expecting to need a new gel insole and may get one anyways but these are well worth the money and look pretty well put together. After having 2 pair of ASICS fall apart on me that cost 3X as much I’m extremely happy,5,1,28.0
 The size is perfect I ordered a 10 and that is what I got. The do not wear comfortably at all I tried Nike insoles in them a little better but these shoes were going to cause blisters and feet problem for sure.,1,0,28.0

When my kids saw them, they did compliment me on them. I liked that they had them in all colors. I will order some of the other colors . I purchased them for comfort because I suffer from back pains, and they are super comfortable.",5,1,28.0
"I really like these sneakers! I needed a pair for the gym but didn’t want to pay crazy prices because I really don’t do cardio. I can’t speak for how they are as running shoes, but I found them very comfortable and also lightweight. They look great and it would be difficult to beat the price! Overall definitely recommended!",5,1,28.0
"Pros: Stylish, cool.
Cons: 5 pair eyelets instead of 6; no shock absorption - like wearing clogs.

The blades are made of a stiff ABS type plastic, if they were instead made using a stiff rubber (like used for engine mounts) they would be much more comfortable for athletic walking / running.",3,0,28.0
"Overall, I am not impressed with these shoes. The knit cloth material is about the only pro to these shoes, seemingly much better quality compared to the same style from the check company shoes. That's where the pros end. The plastic material feels super cheap. Think those springy looking soles are springy? Nope. Super stiff. The actual rubber on the bottom is super thin. And NO, these are NOT slip proof, nor resistant. The shoelaces seem like dollar store quality. As for the fit, for the length I found they were almost spot on. The width, they are super narrow. I have thin feet, and these are tight for me. Some people said you cannot remove the insoles, and that is false. Easily removable.

Tldr, you get less than what you pay for. Beware.",2,0,28.0
"These shoes were great to start out with. However, after less than 6 months, they started falling apart. I've now had them for less than a year and they've had to find their way to the trash because they're splitting and the insides are completely torn up. The worst part is, I really haven't been hard on them at all. I was using them primarily to have something more comfortable to wear at work, and I spend the vast majority of time at work sitting or standing for brief periods. I hadn't done much walking in them at all since I didn't want them getting trashed quickly from that sort of wear and tear. Ultimately, these are over priced, cheaply made junk. You're better off with a $10 pair of shoes from Walmart.",1,0,28.0
"I took a chance with these shoes after reading a lot of negative reviews, because there were also some pretty good ones, but the second I put them on and stood up they were pretty painful. I showed in the pictures why, they have big circles on the bottom of the shoe without any support, the one at the top of the shoe is about an half inch deep and you can feel the edges dig into your feet, I can only imagine how bad it would be once the soles get worn out. They were shipped in a bag so both shoes are deformed. Horrible purchase, returning them.",1,0,28.0
Shoes came in open plastic bag and one was missing the insole. Shoe was also very hard and not flexible or comfortable. They were also much smaller and did not measure the same as size chart on the site. I was very disappointed and promptly returned them.,1,0,28.0
"First off, the color is amazing and fit is spot on! However, comfort isn't what you may think. The sole of the shoe is VERY hard and has ZERO give. So if you are looking for a ""spring"" like shoe, these are not them! You could probably add a insole into the main part to help some with that. I have found (for me) these are pretty comfortable when I am up and walking around, but when standing in one place for too long......forget it! Feels like I'm standing on a brick. The shoes themselves are pretty heavy for what's sold as ""running"" shoes. I'm sure it's due to the thick material used in the soles. So if you're looking for light weight, keep looking. I usually wear Asics and these are no where near that (I didn't expect it to be). However, for the price these are great for occasional wear, but I wouldn't wear these to the hospital, for my 12+ hour shift. Overall, I would buy them for outside of work use.....the style and colors are so fun!",4,1,28.0
TOO SMALL. Ordered my size...what came was cute but way too small. Ordered the next size up and paid again only for the same small shoe to show up claiming to be a size larger. Not purchasing again...I guess I would have to order 3-4 sizes larger. I so wanted these to work out but returning both tomorrow. Thumbs down!!!,1,0,28.0
The bedding of the sneakers is too harsh and feels uncomfortable when walking/running with it. I don’t recommend it at all.,1,0,28.0
"they are some fancy looking shoes, but only if you are wearing them in sterile surroundings., all those cutouts and holes collect dust, stones, grass clippings, and as a city dweller, god forbid dog gifts....

They are not good for running, very hard shoes,a s well as shallow and bit wobbly - the heal is quite narrrow and I have almost twisted my ankle tree four times...

" When you walk in the shoes it feel like there walking with you, felt like they would give my feet problems but did not hurt them at all the first day of trying them out at the house, so the first day of work I put some insole just to make sure my feet where not hurting and they felt good all day, big surprise to me, but as far as driving a car with these shoes on, please do not do it, they are slippery on the petals, these are some light weight, I wear a 10.5 to 11, I order a 10.5 and fit right like a Michael Jackson glove, overall I thank everyone who got back to me on the good reviews and the bad reviews, I switch back and forth with different pair of shoes so my big feet do not settle and hurt.",3,0,28.0
"Bought in January, and just over 2 months later, the soles are wearing out and the inside back by the heel has worn down to hard plastic and is rubbing a sore spot on the back of my heel and they can't be used any more.

I walk about 10,000 steps a day, sometimes up to 16,000 steps, so these got a good workout.

They were a bit large, which was surprising because I have wide Hobbit feet and I ordered a regular width 42 European size and that's usually a bit tight.

I got a lot of compliments on the style and the bright yellow! I did like the style, too, personally.

If you need serious walking shoes that will last more than 2 or 3 months, skip these. If you mostly sit or stand and don't rack up the mileage quickly (5-8 miles/day), these are a good option.",3,0,28.0
Many I’ve seen on this website saying that these are great shoes! The shoes are made in China and sold through a distributor in this country. Comparing to other name sneakers these are total junk don’t waste your time and money spend the extra and get a comfortable light lasting shoe.,1,0,28.0
"I love these shoes! Inexpensive, comfortable, stylish, fun to wear, and good quality materials used to make them. I'm on my third day wearing them, they are comfortable to wear for long periods of time like work or school. I love all the color combinations they come in, and considering getting another pair since they are all-season shoes. I am a weirdo who prefers not to have a name brand or logo on my shoes or clothes, so that is another plus.
A Great buy, I highly recommend, just hope they stand the test of time.",5,1,28.0
I didn’t have a problem with the shoes quality other than them hurting my feet. So I decided to switch the Insoles and upon doing so I found a dead creature under the sole. These are Fresh out of the bag so they were delivered that way. Check under your sole!,1,0,28.0
"So the shoes are stylish light weight but for some reason the front of the shoe you can feel these pressure points that hurt after walking around for a bit. At first I thought they were designed like that and I just needed to wear them in a little but after a few days my feet hurt from them.

If you buy these shoes get some insoles you will thank me",2,0,28.0
"this shoes is a very good light shoes it was my mistake to buy it big thinking it would fit right, it fits comfortable, good for running once you have the right size, on grass on pavement, in dirt, its so comfortable I only remember its big when I make a sudden turn again its an amazing shoe, foot support well locked in altho its big again that was my fault if you normally wear a 9 I would recommend a half size smaller for the perfect fit, it might work for some but its a very good shoe for the price",5,1,28.0
Bought these for work as bartender. On my feet all night and dress code requires black shoes. Was trying to keep expenses down and bought this off brand. Very low quality. They cut into the tops of my feet and have very little flex. Couldn’t wait to take them off at end of night. Returning and buying Nikes. The extra $20 will be well spent.,2,0,28.0
"This is definitely a fashion sneaker not a workout sneaker. The sneaker has a very stiff sole and the shoe insert is thin with no comfortable cushioning and/or support. The pair I received was NOT NEW as I expected and paid for!!! The insert was used and stained so I removed them and replaced them with new Dr. Scholl's Heavy Duty Inserts. Also, the bottom of the sneaker had asphalt tar spots from prior use. If it was not for the ""green color"" I would have returned them for a full refund but, I decided to clean them up and make them work.",3,0,28.0
Have had these for about a month and so far they are decent the only problem with them is that you need to be careful when driving. As part of the design for the shoes there are large holes in the bottom of the show big enough to catch the corner of the brake or gas peddles while driving causing you to not be as fast as necessary when hitting the brakes.,3,0,28.0
"Beautiful style, love the look, light weight but extremely uncomfortable needed to add gel insoles, felt like walking on concrete.",2,0,28.0
"These sneakers look good, very eye cathing but not really built for working out or even running. The sole of the sneaker is made of hard plastic so it's not flexible. The shoe tread is a very thin piece of rubber. That's gonna wear out soon enough if you wear it often. The insole is also very thin. I had to buy comfort insole to get these sneakers to work for me. Again, they are better for show, not for working out.",4,1,28.0
"I like the color and design, light weight. What I don’t like is insole has no cushioning. It will not be great for a long time walking. The quality looks suspicious so I m not sure if this sneakers will last the same as a brand ones. I don’t think that you can wash then in washing machine since it looks like they a glued.",4,1,28.0
Love the shoe... Have several colors of the same... However this blue is more of an Aqua color than actual light blue... I really wanted the light blue to match my scrubs but this shade is off by a bit... Looks exactly right in the photo though but was not what I expected regarding the shade of blue when it arrived... No big deal.. I'll make it work...,4,1,28.0
The shoes fit true to size and look just like the product photos. I purchased these for my father and so far he says they are comfortable and lightweight. He prefers wearing them with thin socks over thicker socks. He’s debating purchasing another pair in a different color because of the reasonable price and additional coupon.,5,1,28.0
"Shoe looks good and I get compliments on that. I wear a 12 mens and these are true to size. Only issue is insole isnt as padded as I would like, but more padded than Chucks and other shoes I've tried, but at this price, I can't complain. Wore them on a mountain trail this week and they performed great.",4,1,28.0
"Thought these sneakers would be light weight but there actually pretty heavy. The way its designed, theres a hard part that presses into the ball under your big toe. Also, don’t drive a car with these on, with soles hollowed out in the center, they get caught on the pedals! Very dangerous. Good concept, poor design!",1,0,28.0
"Very unstable shoe cheaply made typical China product, easy to roll in ankle mostly because your foot slides off the soul and starts to twist in process",1,0,28.0
Shouldn't have expected much from an off brand. My 16 year old son wanted these for track because they matched uniform colors and he thought they looked cool. They do look cool but they have to be the most uncomfortable sneaker I've ever worn (I tried them on as well). These will most likely sit in a closest until we sell them at a yardsale or donate them. Don't waste your money unless you don't need support or you have stones for feet.,1,0,28.0
"These fit as expected and look cool. Otherwise, don't buy them if you're off average size. I'm 6' 2"" 230 pounds and these shoes were awful from the moment I put them on.

"Original: I got them in last night. They don’t come in a box, but they come in a bag. They look nice and sturdy. I have a workout class this evening that I’ll use them in! Will update after usage!

I bought these for my husband to work out and use to go out casual. They look very stylish. He gets a lot of compliments. I don’t hear any complaints from him so I think they’re comfortable. I’ve already washed in the washing machine gentle cold and air dry. Washed well and holding up,5,1,28.0
"I think that they are unique, and I get a lot of compliments on them. I don't think that they are comfortable to do much but to walk in then on flat surfaces. I hate that the insole comes out when you take them off because they are not secured to the shoe.",4,1,28.0
I purchased these shoes for working out at the gym. They look great and are light weight but the sculped soles do not flex much and there is not enough padding under the ball of the foot. I am currently trying some pads I got at the local store. Not too bad for an hour workout but I would not want to wear them all day unless the pads I just got work out.,3,0,28.0
These shoes are generic with no labels. The fire design saves them from looking too fake. I wear a size 9 in women’s sneakers and ordered a 7 in these (men’s).

range! An amazing pair of sneakers! They fit like a glove and are very lightweight and comfortable. I was not expecting this kind of shoe on this price range. I use them for the gym . The soles hold up so well. Very study and again lightweight. I would pay twice for these puppies,5,1,28.0
"I got to tell you. I got these sneakers today, and was concerned about how they would fit, since I did not try them on. These sneakers felt so good. I wore them today just to break them in, but once I put them on, I was truly amazed on how comfortable they fit. For a unknown brand name, I rate these sneakers up there with my K-Swiss, Puma and Reebox as far as comfort. I would definitely recommend these sneakers. Great looking walking sneakers and considering purchasing another pair in the near future.",5,1,28.0
"The first thing I noticed is that the shoe was too small. I ordered size 11.5, But I don't know if that's what I got because there's no size anywhere on the shoe (picture) or the bag or label. When I put it next to a size 11 they were exactly the same size (picture). Returning.",2,0,28.0
"I run early in the morning so got the bright green highlighter color. Slightly large on my feet, I’m a 10.5 in most shoes so ordered that size. When they got broke in after a few runs, I would definitely order a half size smaller, personally.

I guess you get what you pay for. They have a very weird fit. They aren't wide but have a ton of space on the top of the shoe. The size as far as length is good and fits as expected.

"I thought a shoe with writing on the side look kindof cool. I laughed my butt off upon opening the shoe box. It says “just so-so�?on the shoe. Well that accurately describes this purchase. Although modern looking, this shoe is incredibly cheap. First, the sole feels like you’re pushing down on concrete. There’s no comfort to the shoe whatsoever. Second, the heel support flexes down and back so it feels like you’re sinking into the back of the shoe. You can feel the base through the sole which lead to blisters on my feet. Also, after two days of wearing I noticed the Shoes started making farting sounds from the heel area. So over all I’d say this shoe is “so-so�?at best if best is described as an uncomfortable feeling and flatulent sounding shoe. It’s an excellent party favor though. When people see the “just so-so�?label on the side of the shoe laughter ensues. This causes me to think. What if every company started creating slogans that accurately depicted the quality of their products?",1,0,28.0

The looks of the shoes are eye catcher but they weigh like a 10 lbs on the feet’s. To make story short, it’s a deceiving fake product, they are very heavy. I urge you to stay away from it.
Lastly, I asked if I could return it but I haven’t heard from them, now I’m stuck with it.

"Where do I begin with these “shoes�? You know those wooden shoes the Dutch wear/wore? I would workout in them for a week before I workout in these bad boys again. Not sure if you can tell from the pics, but the shoes actually have written across both sides “Just So So�? I only wish “so-so�?were true. There is nothing stylish, comfortable, or even wearable about these things. I’m pretty sure they are 3-D printed out of completely, non-flexible polypropylene. The “Just So So�?was hilarious. Other than that I wouldn’t wear these shoes again if they were covered in silk, memory foam and velvet.",1,0,28.0
This product fits a little snug because of all of the support that’s inside. I have very high arches so the cushioning inside the sneaker is very supportive and comfortable. If you wear a size 9 or a size 8 1/2. I’m sure I will order a similar sneaker again. This week will be specifically for fashion purposes only. Over I am satisfied with this product,5,1,28.0
"My husband love these tennis shoes. I bought them for him for Christmas. These shoes are stylish and look very nice with his jeans and sport clothes.

I highly recommend these tennis shoes.",5,1,28.0
"These, for the price are excellent shoes.

I’ve asked a couple of people how much they thought it cost and they said 130!

The price is right, size is accurate, plenty of room for thick socks and wide feet. Gives me extra reach on my pedal and quite comfortable to drive in.

5 stars, the only thing i didn’t like was the long floppy laces but still a good buy.",5,1,28.0
"Part of the tread on the sole is starting to unglue and separate after just one month of gym use. Mostly weights and a little walking on treadmill, so not even long term running. Hardly ever wear the shoes outside of the gym, other that to walk through the parking lot. Just makes you wonder how quickly they would fall apart with actual running on concrete or pavement. Not worth the price for the hassle of starting to fall apart after such a short time, spend double your money on a name brand shoe.",1,0,28.0
"I got caught up in the ""must try"" trend on these and tried them for the first time today.

Let me just start by saying I'm athletic and over the years, (I won't say how many, but it is more than three decades), I have worn most of the brands of shoes by trial and error in training, races, and for every day gym use. I go through a new pair of running shoes every two months or so because they get miled out. I consistently use about three major brands and need stability due to overpronation.

These on first try on were stiff in the soles but a little flexible in the lacings. They stayed stiff in the soles through their first workout. They give back ZERO when you're wearing them. There is no foam or gel in there anywhere-just an insole to keep you from jarring on the crinkly hard plastic sole. They have some flex in the midfoot but as soon as they flex, those hard plastic wings on the side that hold the last lace hole will jab you in the ankle. The lace holding wings anchor the laces, which is good because the rest of the lacing is just through sewn to the top loops that aren't lined up very well to give you a custom fit when you try to cinch them or move them around. The lacing also seems too high on the foot, it starts midfoot instead of lower above the toes. Lastly, the shoes give a really hard ride and even walking will make you wonder if you have shin splints. I also have the suspicion that for my pair at least, the left shoe is different in construction than the right...something feels off. Production quality is definitely as lacking as the tech in these babies.

All in all, I hate to be less than positive, but these shoes are really just for looks. I love the colors and the SO SO tape on them, they're like if Ikea made running shoes, this would be them. They look like a running shoe, cost a small penny, and ultimately they do go on your feet. I guess I'd keep them in the bugout bag just in case, but I sure wouldn't run or workout in them. I gave them two stars for style & color.",2,0,28.0
"Minus 2 Stars. To be fair, I didn't expect much and they were cheap so I decided to give them a try. Plus, most Amazon recommendations are not complete garbage; these shoes are. The fit is way off. I wear a 9-1/2. These are 10 and my toes were cramped due to the poor design. They are very difficult to get on (I'll skip the details). Most of all, the cushioning you expect from the perforated soles is non-existent. They're like wearing a couple of bricks. Maybe the worst thing I've ever bought. Junk. Junk, junk, junk. Returned with a vengeance.",1,0,28.0
"I have seen these on here for months and finally decided to give them a shot, and honestly, im kicking myself for not buying them sooner. I work as a massage therapist and I'm on my feet for 6-8 hours a day. So I need good shoes. A few months ago I got a pair of New Balance and for me they were terrible. Mushy soles with no support. I followed those with the exact opposite and got a pair of Hoka shoes. Very supportive, but it looks like I stole them from my grandpa. These shoes are a perfect mix. The molded plastic bottoms provides a much better standing surface, and these look amazing in person. Very good build quality for the price. I would say like just a small notch below Nikes and Addidas. I had a couple strings that needed snipped back but nothing major. For the price you won't beat these. If you have kids that want the 200+ yeezys or something, these are a great alternative on a budget. Plus the ""just so so"" is absolutely hilarious lol Anyways I hope this helps someone",5,1,28.0
"On the plus side these shoes are pretty light & the top material feels breathable.

Unless you are walking on the backs of the heals, these have 0, nodda, no cushion, so if you are walking on concrete you feel like you are barefoot on concrete. Scratch that, in bare feet on flat concrete you don't have any pressure points against the sides of your feet causing them to go numb after less then a mile of walking. These are now on their way back after maybe an hour of use.",1,0,28.0
"When I first got the shoes I was super excited about them, reading all the videos I had high high hopes. Aesthetically. They are gorgeous but when trying to work out in them they aren't functional. I walk everyday anywhere from 3 to 5 miles daily, uphill. When first trying them on they were super small, I got a mens size 8 (I wear women's 10) but easily loosened up after my first trial walk of 1.5 miles. I took them out the next day 3 miles and at first they were comfortable I was able to do my first mile in 19 mins (usually takes me 21 mins in my old shoes) thats when I noticed the burning in my backs of my heel(s), when I got home I took off my shoes and socks to examine my heels they were a little raw but no skin broken.

I took them out today for my usual 5 miles and I couldn't get half way on my usual routine when I started noticing blood coming my sock. These shoes have something metal in the back of the shoes that pierce the heel, I can feel my heels rubbing up against it as I walk. I really had a lot of hope with these shoes but I am having to return them. I'll just upfront the money I was going to pay for a better pair.",2,0,28.0
"I’m not a fan - my wife has a pair and loves them, so I bought a pair to try.

I like the quirky style - the shoes look exactly like they do in the photo. The fabric is reasonably comfortable and I think it will wear well (durable). On a different sole, I think the shoe would be comfortable.

So, that’s it - I don’t like the soles. They look ok, however, they feel like plastic. I’m heavy and the shoes don’t offer much support (they don’t give at all, they feel like I’m wearing wooden clogs).

For working out, I normally wear running shoes. I used to wear five fingers - I haven’t found them where I live, so I’ve had to look at other options. If you’re not familiar with 5-fingers, they are essentially gloves for your feet and offer no support. Even so, they are more comfortable than the “just so so�?brand (from my perspective).... (I offer the 5-finger perspective to explain that I’ve happily worn shoes with “no support�?and I’d rather work out barefooted than work out in these “just so so�?shoes.)

To be clear, I am not endorsing the five finger brand, nor am I encouraging you to buy some other shoe - I’m just providing a reference.

Anyway - I like the uniqueness of the shoe and would recommend them if they were more comfortable. For me, the sole is too rigid so the support isn’t there for me.

I gave 2-stars because my wife loves them (5-stars from her) and I’m not a fan.... even so, if you buy them, I hope you like them.",2,0,28.0
"So after opening the box, the shoe looks great and looks exactly like the picture. My first concern was that they wouldn't fit well cause I didn't try them on in the store, but they fit perfectly, I was pretty shocked. So, so far the shoe looks exactly like the picture and fits great, even better than shoes I've bought in the past.

When you first put the shoe on there is a weird feeling, cause it has an unusual insert, I almost thought there was some paper still in the shoe at first, but after a while, you get used to it and it is no longer a bother. The bottom of this shoe is like some kind of plastic, and this is where the real problem with the shoe comes, when I walk or run in this shoe, the heel of my foot smashes into this plastic at full force and you can really feel it, after just one 2 mile run, I made it about half a mile before switching back to my old shoes. The shoes were super affordable, so I might try a custom insert, but honestly, the shoe fits so perfectly IDK if a thicker insert will fit. If you can find a way for the heel to get a bit more protection this could be a great shoe for the price, as it stands I would not recommend running in, and even walking in I can still feel my heel hitting really hard.",3,0,28.0
"These shoes are so comfortable! I’m very surprised with the quality of these shoes, considering where they are made (hint: definitely not in the States, as it says “Just So So�?and other random sayings around the shoe). The insert is pretty cushioned, and they don’t feel like they’re too hard on the bottoms when walking. However, I would not recommend running or working out in these since they don’t offer the support for that - these are strictly for fashion and basic walking around.

I got these men’s shoes because they don’t have my size in women’s, so if you’re a gal, just know they’re a little clunky! If that doesn’t bother you, then you’re golden. I wear these with ankle skinny jeans and a basic t-shirt or hoodie and I feel like I’m back in the L.A. homeland already.

They also have this awesome neon color that can double as an aircraft marshalls�?guide on flight lines ;) anyway, these are a great buy if you want street fashion, but don’t want to pay the Yeezy price tag to get it. I totally expect to get them in at least one or two more colors!",5,1,28.0
These are some great shoes to wear walking or shopping. They are stylish and will definitely get you looks if you re looking something out of the ordinary. The lime green and orange ones are great for safety when walking the roads during low visibility hours. They come in a variety of colors to go with anything in your casual wardrobe as well and are definitely attention getters. The key to buying these is to look for the ones with the cuts near the front. Those are the true walking/shopping shoes which have the flexibility needed for comfort. There are multiple sellers of these on here and other sites and some sell the flat bottom versions which are fine for just wearing out but (BEWARE) that they don't give good traction on wet surfaces!! If you don't like them you can always sit on them and sell them later as the prices go up or just collect them because they re cute!! :-),5,1,28.0
"If you're like me and ONLY buy after reading great reviews about a product, then read my review and simply press the buy button! (I buy from Amazon at least once a week!) Honestly, this product was just as described and very cute packaging. It shipped really fast too. I look for quality when buying anything and this met my standards 100%. I'm not too big on writing reviews all the time but I took the time out to do so because I'm very please with this purchase. I would definitely buy again!",5,1,28.0
"Had the shoes for about a week now.
Looking at the pics on Amazon for the shoe, I was under the assumption that with the lattice design of the sole, that these shoes would be very 'cushy' and springy to wear. That's not the case (hence the 4-star rating), but not bad overall.

PROS:
- Fit is true. They do run a bit longer in the toes, but not overly long.
- Tongues are sewn to the sides of the uppers, so they are fixed in place and won't slide to the side as you walk. I REALLY like this feature, because I'm always adjusting the tongues in my other shoes during the day.
- They are fairly comfortable to walk in all day. even though they aren't as cushy/springy as I was hoping for. To me, it almost feels like I'm walking in bare feet. At the end of the day, my feet don't feel as sore as with my other shoes, so I'm pleasantly surprised by that result !
- The large loops at the back of the shoe are REALLY helpful in getting them on. I've had no problems with them getting in the way of walking / driving, etc. at all.
- So far no issues with the glue on the soles coming apart. Will update this review if that changes.

CONS:
- Fit is a bit snug. If you need a wide shoe, you may want to jump to the next size to see if that helps.
- (and this is a minor ""Con"") - they do make a slight squeaky noise when you walk in them. Not overly loud, but somewhat noticeable.
- I wouldn't recommend them for Running. Definitely more of a walking shoe.

Overall I would rate these as AVERAGE. I paid $46 for these and don't feel they are worth any more than that.

[08/26/2021 Update]: Have been wearing these now everyday this month, and I don't have any discomfort at the end of the day like I do with my other shoes (even those with my Orthotic inserts in them!) The feel to me, like I stated previously feels like walking barefoot - which I THOUGHT would be a huge problem for me - turns out it seems to be just what I needed.

The sole on the right shoe is starting to peel away from the toe (slightly), but other than that I have no issues with these shoes so far.",4,1,28.0
"Here is another import cheaper style shoe that you can actually work out in. I still wouldn't recommend that you work out with them, but you can as they might not last long. Comfort is an A+. Style is an A++. Support is a high B+. I was shocked at their comfort. The cushioned removeable soul is soft and the innards of the shoe fit like a pillow puff. The shoe is solid and flexible at the same time. I put prosthetics in them and they tolerated them with no problems and gave me that extra arch support my feet require. The hard rubber is both soft and supportive. They are a bit long in the front, but you should have no problems ordering the right size for your foot. These shoes are slip-ons and will eventually have slip on problems due to stretching. I have the blue and green and I also bought the green and yellow. The shoes breath like a healthy nose and the fleecing cools your feet and dries water pretty fast. I was really shocked at the style and performance for the price. Delivery was acceptable with no problems. I also purchased a pink white version as a gift and....wow! Is all I can say. The hard rubber soul is built to last, but the rubber tread underneath is not going to last very long. I will consider more purchases for the future. I use these shoes after I use my serious trainers and get cleaned up to hit the town. This shoe is huge on style and they are very bright in any color. Their performance seems to be hidden in the style, but the performance is there. These shoes should cost double or more then what they are asking.",5,1,28.0
"I would not recommend these shoes for anyone who’s trying to exercise or put a lot of miles into them. I just returned mine because the tread on the bottom was starting to peel off after 2 weeks of having them. They’re also really snug so if you were to buy them, I’d get a size larger than usual.",1,0,28.0
"Well.... at least this part isn't limited like the seller feedback. I ordered these shoes on July 31st 2020. They arrived 5 days later (today) on Aug 5th. Not too awful bad of a wait for the so called amazing Prime Shipping. I have probably close to 50 pair of shoes from boots to sandals to Vibram toe shoes. Everyone single one of them is size 12! 40 years old, I've had the same shoe size for more than 20 years now. Sometimes shoes fit differently based on how they are made and the company that makes them, I get that. However, these arrive in a clear plastic bag wadded up and placed loosely in am Amazon box. Immediately when I pulled them out I knew they couldn't be a size 12 because I thought I was going to need a forklift to pick them up. I take them out and hold them up to the size 12 Reebok that were currently on my feet. Yeah, I don't think so!! HAHA So I put one on. My toes barely came to the bottom of the laces!! They didn't even go into the toe section of the shoe! I couldn't help but have one of those dumb WTF looks on my face! The side of the shoe say ""(Something) SO SO (Something)"". That's as far as I'd go with describing these shoes, SO SO!! I mean the fabric appears to be made of whatever that is in the corner of your mouth when you wake up in the morning. I order a size 12 and got sent two boats made from belly button lent. I look under the tongue to see what size they actually sent me. There is NOTHING but a little tiny 1/4 inch tag that says 2048 on one side and 46 on the other. Besides that, there is NOTHING on these shoes to tell you a size, what it's made of, where it came from (even though the plastic bag is plastered with ""MADE IN CHINA"") I mean NOTHING on these shoes!! I'm going to recommend NOT buying these shoes! They were literally in my possession for 30mins before I printed off a label and made my way to Kohls to return them. I did actually consider keeping them though. We are going on a Scuba diving trip this September and I could always use a pair of flippers!! In all honesty, for almost $50 you'd be better off just buying a pair of socks instead of these shoes. They will protect your feet for a short amount of time on hot pavement and that's about it. So for a lot less you could just get a pair of socks!

Not happy with Amazon's listing of these because the sizes are WAY OFF!! They are junk material and the process from purchase to returning them through Amazon before you get any money back needs MAJOR WORK!!

Oh and I gave a 2 star rating because lets be honest, no one needs a 1 star.",2,0,28.0
" Overall, I love these shoes for my everyday work needs. I experience no foot or knee pain at the end of my day. I, highly, recommend that you give them a try and see if they work for you. I've purchased three pairs in different colors from the same company and they all fit differently. The black with red trim is my favorite because they provide the most room and comfort. The fit is a little bigger in men's sizes and the women's is a bit snug. With the minor size issues I can't say they're true to size, but I've never had to send a pair back either. I suggest full size up on women's, half size down in men's. You can't go wrong for the price and style in multiple colors. The only real annoyance is that you'll be, constantly, telling everybody that these aren't Nikes.",5,1,28.0
The shoes are nice looking but run larger than expected. I should have exchanged them for a size small but unfortunately I needed them for work ASAP. I have had the shoes now for about two weeks and the soles are coming apart. I walk on finished concrete all day as I work in a retail environment. I don’t think I would suggest these to others. As a pair of shoes should last Ionger than two weeks.,3,0,28.0
"The title plus description claims that these shoes can be used for tennis. I decided to buy three pairs because I go through tennis shoes frequently. These shoes should NOT be used to play tennis. The sole design is prone to cause damage to the foot, specifically the ankle and plantar fascia. Beware if you are going to purchase. Also, after two matches the tread of the shoe will be completely worn. Nice looking but will not be usefull for tennis.",1,0,28.0
I was not a fan of these. Kinda a weird fit like my foot didn’t feel like it was where it was suppose to go. The show itself is very bulky and not flattering. Not a fan of these. And what is the writing all over suppose to be very confusing.,1,0,28.0
"Maybe mine were made wrong but I wasn't too pleased. The style itself was nice which is why I purchased initially. However the shoe strings are very basic and there was really no way to tighten and tie them due to how it's made. When I did the elastic part under the shoe string bunched up and made it super uncomfortable. Plus it was a wide show to me. I wear 13's but I had another pair of similar build shoes on, and there was no comparison on how they fit/looked. Realize these are at the bottom of the price spectrum but regardless I wasn't too pleased. Maybe smaller feet they fit better on but for me it just didn't work out I guess but give them a try if u like. They look good in pics and in person but just beware if you have a larger foot.",2,0,28.0
"I bought two pairs of these sneakers, the red and the black and red. They look great and fit well. They are fine for walking around at my job and in public but not good for running on the treadmill or elliptical work. I use a pair of Asics model 21's for running on equipment and these sneakers do not compare to those Asics. The soles are just too uncomfortable especially in the balls of the feet/fore foot area for running. I honestly use my Vibram 5 finger sneakers for running outside and they are a lot more comfortable than these for that activity. There is just something a little odd or off about the sole and heal shape and padding. They are very good looking fashion sneakers and for 30 - 35 dollars I would buy them again.
The bottom of the sneakers is a hard rubber that gets slippery when it's wet so I have to tread somewhat carefully when walking around and the pavement is wet because they tend to slide. - again for 30- 35 it's a decent fashion sneaker, It's no Asics, it's Just So So... : )",3,0,28.0
"When I first purchased these sneakers the insoles were flat. Now it has a considerable amount of cushioning that encourages me to repurchase the previous version. These shoes👟 really turns some heads like you wouldn’t believe. Especially the red ones, I get so many complements from them it’s overwhelming. I’m a 49er fan so I wear the red and red/black ones a lot. The new version makes you feel like you are floating on air. And for some reason the seem to be a little bit more roomy. I thought I had every color, but hold on, they have many. I’m still looking and searching for more beautiful colors. These sneakers 👟 are amazing.",5,1,28.0
"I bought my husband his first pair in May as he wears steal toed leather boots all day at work and needed something that breathed more. They have definitely helped in the breathability part, big bonus on his feet. We have found that because he wears steal toed boots at work he is EXTREMELY hard on his regular shoes so the honeycomb sole does not work well for him and he does have a bit of a penguin walk which makes his feet slide to the inside of his shoes, very hard on the glue to these shoes. I will say this, it will really depend on how you wear out your other shoes as to whether these will work out for you. You still can't beat the price. We've spent A LOT more to have a pair of shoes fall apart in less than a week. My husband needs more of a running shoe that can handle the abuse, he'll just have to start changing his socks before he leaves work. Side note: I have 2 pairs of these shoes. Am a diabetic with special orothotics, have MS, use a walker, cane and leg brace(s) to help walk and I LOVE YHE HELL OUT OF THESE SHOES for many reasons; this why I got hubby to try a pair.",5,1,28.0

He said they are very comfortable and he loves them and I believe him he is always in them! The photo is him in the space needle so yeah he wears them all the time! Now my daughter wants a pair! I can’t blame her I do too now.",5,1,28.0
I was super excited getting these ones as they looked amazing on the photos and had great reviews. I think it’s hit or miss if you get shoes that actually look like that. Mine were different size even though it said the same. Put them next to each other and it’s 1/2�?off. One of them also had uneven sole. The back part was much bigger than picture. Super disappointed because I wanted to love them. But just feels like cheap toy shoes. No quality at all. Will try to order a new pair and see if I have better luck since reviews are good.,1,0,28.0
"Pros...Beautiful design. Sole looks more like a Nike Shox kinda design. Nike uses tough plastic with reinforcement . It will initially give a hardened fell, but will last longer as its prone to more impact. This shoe feels comfortable right out of the box. However since the plastic under the sole is more elastic, over time it gives up. You will find your heel leaning inboard since there is no rigid support. I don't use this for workout. Just regular walking. Had this for about 6 months now..Used it probably less than 5 times per month and its already loosing its support. Spend the $$ and get a better designed and tested product.",3,0,28.0
"First impressions - I had seen people wearing these and just like everyone else I thought they were Nikes or some other premium brand. I decided to give them a go after reading several reviews from independent websites as well as Amazon feedback. They fit perfectly. I had a wide foot size 12 and ordered a size 12. Some of the reviews said they run a bit big but that is not the case for me.

There is padding under the ball of the foot as well as good arch support. I can see why a benefit of these shoes is plantar fasciitis support.

They move and bend easily and I don't believe any type of break in period will be needed. My primary purpose for buying these was to complete my boxing workouts that consists of shadow boxing, heavy bag work, and a lot of jump rope. With a sturdy build and what seems to be a dependable sole they will hold up for sure.",5,1,28.0
I ABSOLUTELY Love these shoes! I was iffy before BUT when I tried them on...I loved them UNTIL this sudden white spots kept appearing on the shoe. It is embarrassing bc I have to constantly keep wiping off the top of the shot to remove the white cloudy spots that keep resurfacing.,2,0,28.0
"I bought these shoes to play tennis in and maybe do some light walking. From the outset when I unpackaged I realized the bottom of the shoes was not like regular and seemed cumbersome.

After trying it on i felt as if I had on a dancing shoes and not a sneakers. Shoes was not soft to the ground as you walked so I was very nervy to play tennis with these. I ventured out to the court for a quick one hour game. The shoes made running to warm up and stretching feel like a lot of work but I figured it’s a new pair or shoes and different style to get used to. I was feeling pains in my sole as well as shin but decided to play anyway.

The shoes was not comfortable. They felt heavy at times. At other times I could barley move around as the shoes were not soft to the ground so powering off from one position to the next was really hard. I decided that I wouldn’t change them and play on hoping it would get better. But they just didn’t feel like tennis shoes or walking shoes or any shoes.

I doubt I’ll play in them again as I am not sure this will be good for an active game as tennis.

I also looked at the bottom of the shoes when I as done just to see if anything was there to cushion my steps and to my surprise after jus an hour of playing the bottom of the shoes had already worn down. So these won’t be lasting long. Pictures included to show. This was first wear first game less than two hours.

Not pleased.

I didn’t give it a one star rating since I’ve only worn it once and maybe I’m not giving it a fair chance. But right now I’m not sure I’ll be playing in them again.

Hunt for another tennis shoes continues

"I bought these as they are billed as walking, running, kind of an all around shoe. I have bought Sketchers in the past and really like the fit. I have only had them a couple of days so the jury is out but my first impressions are that they are pretty good.
The fit was reasonable but they do not have a traditional ""tongue"". It is attached all the way up and does not move like most shoes. The laces were way too long so I replaced them with the stretch not tie type which I do for all my shoes. They are comfortable when walking or working out at the gym. They are a little noisy when I walk on the road. I believe it is the sole design that creates this. I will update this in a month.",4,1,28.0

"These shoes will make you look and feel cool, especially if older.
I'm older but very fit compared to most peoples standards, but don't always like having to buy expensive Nikes to prove that, so these shoes kind of do, do the trick, in that can still look athletic, cool and fit, without spending the high dollars.
These shoes do, however, have a tight fit, so best to maybe order size above actual foot size, but the do have a very snug fit to them.
I ordered the black and white model, and the colors contrast is excellent, very bright, making a statement type of bright, people will look down at your feet, or shoes, when wearing these.
I may order more in the future.

"I bought 4 pairs, 2 for myself. I am on my feet all day at work and the are the most uncomfortable shoes on concrete. I bought inserts and they still aren't comfortable enough for work.

"I don’t normally write reviews for any product, but with this shoe I think it’s a good time to start.

First, disclaimer, I have high arches so buying any athletic shoe comes with risks of discomfort. However, the great news is these shoes do not make my arch ache.

Pros: the shoes look great!!!! I got the teal and was super impressed with the look. The quality you get for an inexpensive shoe is pretty great. They were easy to put on and take off, and the tongue being integrated with the shoe makes the fit pretty perfect to size. I wear between a 12/13 depending on the shoe.

Cons: These bad boys are HEAVY!!! It’s like having a concrete block on your foot, and for treadmill workouts it’s not great. Second, the insert of the shoe while comfortable for casual wear, is like a flat pillow under your foot. That’s when you get to the hard rubber sole that is under the footbed. It’s not very forgiving. I ran for about four minutes on the treadmill and that’s when the pain started searing through my feet. I’ll admit I’m a big guy, and weight is likely a contributing factor for this, but I also know walking on concrete for a long time with bare feet is painful too.

All in all, for athletics I would not recommend this shoe if you’re overweight and heavy footed. However, for the price, you can’t beat how fresh these kicks look, they are relatively comfortable when wearing them as a casual shoe, and I would recommend them as a part of your outfit for going out. I get compliments every time I wear them out, but not from my feet when working out.",2,0,28.0
"I love this shoe, for a generic brand it is stylish and very comfortable. The sizes run real big so keep that in mind when ordering.

"First impression, shoes do look nice. Unfortunately that's the only positive thing I can say about this product.

After wearing them for approximately two weeks, light use, basically going to work in my car, changing into my work boots, and then changing back to go home, so maybe 2 to 3 hours a day. Maybe walked a total of 2 to 3 miles in these shoes. Lettering is peeling off. Now looking at them, noticing lots of glue residue near the soles. Yes, this is definitely not a brand name, expensive shoes, but my sketchers that are basically same price, are a quality product.

This is not, nowhere near a quality shoe. I am past the window to return these. Otherwise I would do it in a heartbeat.

"These shoes are comfortable. I like their rounded toes with very little tapering toward the front and the fact that they are deep enough to hold the 5/8"" of padding I have to wear under one heel to keep my hips level. They keep my feet dry when I walk through wet grass or shallow puddles. The strap and loop at the back enable me to get them on without using a shoe horn as I have to for most shoes. The main deficiency is that the black rubbery stuff on the soles started to come off after fewer that a dozen wearings. That doesn't seem to affect shock absorption or traction, but the holes that are exposed pick up gravel from our driveway. They are fine for walking, but I suspect that if I could run, I would find their shock absorption insufficient. They are also somewhat heavier than most shoes I buy for walking,",4,1,28.0

The issue I have is that I wear a 10.5 men's, so I always order a half size up, so I got a size 11. I don't have wide feet and I don't wear wide shoes, but these shoes are so tight around the arches of my feet. On the right foot it feels like something hard and rigid is digging into my skin right under the arch of my foot, and is very tight around this area. I thought maybe it was the soles, so I got some nice Dr. Scholl's ones to try, and I still feel the same hard piece of whatever it is digging through it and into my skin. If I wear it for more than a couple of minutes a blister starts forming.

Sad. Really wanted to like these shoes.",2,0,28.0
"I bought these for my son. He recently started at Home Depot and is on his feet on concrete, lifting concrete and may other heavy things. I had bought him work boots, and he ended up with tendinitis and was off work for a week on doctor's orders. I bought these for him and he worked a full shift yesterday with them. He came home and said he has told all his coworkers that these are the best shoes ever. Trust me, these are much less expensive than our trip to Urgent Care and the loss of a week of work!",5,1,28.0
"The shoes have stylish looks and slip on great but that about it. On a scale comparing these to my Under Armor footwear, these are a 4 where Under Armor is a 10 for me.
- Terrible for walking.
- Heavy
- Stiff and wont break in.
- Foot contour is poor causing unconfutable walking or jogging strides.
- poor padding. This is my biggest complaint with this shoe.
- Soles don't have any spring or absorption so I feels like barefoot walking feeling. That about the best way personal description I can honestly give.",1,0,28.0
"This is a great looking shoe and looks good on foot. I was taking a risk but for $40 I figured I'd give it a try. I wanted a stylish shoe that was different than the norm and affordable. This shoe delivered. For negatives, the box was badly damaged, there was no shoe horn or stuffing in the shoe and the end of toe was slightly wrinkled...almost like I wasn't the 1st one to wear it. I was however pleasantly surprised by the cushion on the ball of the foot. It was nice to walk on. I will still add some gel inserts because I have sensitive heals but I'm glad I got these over all.
** UPDATE **
I felt bad for just leaving a 4 star rating. After putting my gel insert in these and a full day of use, I absolutely love the experience in these shoes. You get style, comfort, something outside the norm for an incredible price. Initially, there was a bias in me that couldn't give a 5 star rating to a $43 overseas shoe...but they delivered big time. I really like these shoes.",5,1,28.0
"Fits good , I am a big man and worried they may break down in the back but there hard plastic in the places where it needs it , the bottom is comin unglued a little on one of the bottom tentacles, you’ll see what I’m talking about if you get them , they feel like the whole shoe is made of recycled material, almost like woven plastic, wipes clean well, over I am pleased and have had almost everyone think they were air max I have to show them and say I can’t afford 150 dollar shoes , I like em there comfy and have held up good a couple months now so for 40 buck BETTER GET YOU SOME.",4,1,28.0
Bottom of shoe falling apart by 3rd time wearing them. Maybe in total wearing the shoes less than 8 or 9 hours total since we got them. Too tight on sides for me and my ol ladys shoes are right size but too tight as well cant wear hers and mine the blue ones are retired because I dont war shoes that fall apart that fast so upset a waste of money and time.,1,0,28.0
"Purchased these last Thursday and wore for the first time on Sunday. Wanted some new shoes to workout and run in. First off these shoes are far from comfortable. They look great, thus the reason for me giving these shoes 2 star but you can feel everything on the ground in these. After running 30mins on a treadmil this is what happened. There is no way I could've done an hour in these. I probably would've ended up in my socks. I would give these a max 10-12 times of wear before the bottom is completely gone. Sucks because they look nice just not great quality. But I guess you get what you pay for. I purchased these and the red pair but will be returning.",2,0,28.0
"The shoe looks great, two times I’ve worn them out I’ve gotten compliments ( everybody thinks they are yeezys) on how nice they look. Though they are unfortunately not comfortable what so ever. I really want to like these shoes but they are not fit for even casual walking. Maybe with really good insoles they could be wearable. You get what you pay for. And these are cheap for a reason.",1,0,28.0
"These looked ""cool"" in the advertisements and photos but once we purchased them....the thrill wore off quickly. The kind of skeletonized sole is lightweight. But....kind of taller than expected, making them a little unstable for sports requiring quick turns. The soles are also kind of slippery and don't appear to have great traction on gym floors or other smooth surfaces. Overall....my kid got a few weeks of wear from them and now they're collecting dust in his closet.",3,0,28.0
"They look very cool, very nice color but they are made too cheaply and I could only wear them for about a month. The rubber under the shoe is very, very thin and started crumbling apart. If you step on the slightest bit of water or moisture on a floor you will slide like your on ice. The inside of my right shoe fell through the bottom of the heel part of the shoe and the shoe strings are so cheap if you pull or scratch lightly they start to like tear. The writing on the shoe are like stickers and come off and get torn very easily. Its just too pour of quality build!!",1,0,28.0
"The Shoe is just amazing with the way it looks for the price. I do not know the quality of life because i am returning the product.
The only problem is the upper part of the show that has clothe. I want a shoe that can hold my feet and not slip. This is exactly opposite. The clothe is little flexible so when you run or Jump, the feet kind of go forward when the shoe is intact.
This is a great shoe for running or Mild speed walking but for sure not for aggressive sport.",4,1,28.0
"I’ve seen many in the nursing field with these same ones. Asked one of my docs how they were and he said “just so so�? Hahaha!

Anyways, I like them. I’ve had them for about a month and some and have worn them for a solid week. They work for my extremely wide and flat feet. Will be getting more for myself and the kids as well. Only thing is one certain type floors I squeak when I walk. Like I just walked through a puddle. Mildly unattractive. Lol",4,1,28.0
"I like the shoe looks good feels good I didn’t notice the tab on the back when I first viewed the shoe, When I got the shoe looking at it I first thought safety hazard why they did that I don’t know , you can get hooked on something so needless to say when I get in my car to takeoff that tab in the back hooked on To the seat handle adjustment underneath the seat Just saying I bought four pairs of these shoes so I’m just gonna cut the tabs off",4,1,28.0
"Purchased these shoes for my son over a year ago. Arch support could be better. The design of this shoe limits the tread surface on the bottom of this shoe. So if your looking for a shoe with strong traction properties required for most sports and working out, this ain't the shoe for you. The support material around the outside of these shoes is hard, so it's not the best for any activity where you might need to stop and change direction quickly. My son got very little use out of these shoes as they were not even comfortable for walking for more than 30 minutes, so we are donating them to charity.",3,0,28.0
"I have a bad back and thought that these would work a little better then the usual shoes, needless to say very much wrong.",1,0,28.0
"Love these shoes! They are so comfortable. Some shoes are uncomfortable to walk in overtime if you’re wearing them all day and then some shoes you have to break in when you first get them. But these shoes were neither of those things. They literally feel like I’m walking on clouds and are true to size. My only complaint is that the women’s sizes only go up to 10 or 10 1/2 and not 11 so I had to get a men’s size 9. I wish that the women had my size because I really like the colors they have available.

The black pair in the photo aren’t mine but my friend said they were comfortable as well.",5,1,28.0
"For the price, it's hard to find a slip-on ""sporty-look"" shoe that is comfortable for all-around activity, such as walking, shopping trips and the like. I found the original insole to be very thin, but a low-priced insole replacement solved that problem nicely. The lacing is more decorative than not, as the tongue is not at all free. This makes it more of a slip-on shoe, not needing to tighten with laces. So far, it has not shown any defects in manufacturing.",4,1,28.0
"It is a step above cheap (Insert brick and mortar Chinese cheap junk Amazon competitor name here) shoes. They are alright to jog in, they look pretty nice too. The flexible soles are pretty nice for working out.

The rubber on the bottom sole is CRAZY thin. Of you're an avid jogger, whip out that bank card. You're gonna need a new pair every other month.

If you are someone just looking for a fashionable, mostly comfortable, and importantly cheap work/casual shoe, these are great.",3,0,28.0
"Size 9 fits good with partial room around the foot. I'm sure a 8.5 would be too tight so I'm not complaining.

Using for work purposes, install and carrying products over grounds that may not always be dry or supplied with the best weather

I'm sure the gap hole lift will help in puddle situation, fingers cross.

Waiting to see how it's handled on a shitty day.

The extra elastic hook on back doesn't seem necessary but maybe ppl hang shoes from hooks alot.

Shoe tying could be a tigher to griping foot. Feel like if I pull the strings will snap.

Ive only rerouted the laces to feel more of a grip when tighted tight.",4,1,28.0
I love The styling and the effort however it caused severe left heel pain... So basically it needs more cushioning. There's folded rubber there but there's no foam inside the shoe. It looks like there's cushioning but there's not. Plus these shoes should Lean Forward just a tiny bit and they are pretty straight across flat so when you're standing straight it feels like you're leaning back on your heels and that's not a good thing. I really wanted to like these shoes.,1,0,28.0
"The word Running and this shoe should never be used in the same sentence. These are not running shoes. They are fashionable, reasonably comfortable but they should not be marketed as running shoes. They have zero lateral support and no heel support. I'm baffled that they are being calling running shoes. These are fashionable, nice looking and can be used for light gym workouts or casual office work. I would not wanna do 8 hours in these shoes if I was standing labor. Former USA team memeber",2,0,28.0
I love these. I wear a size 10 and ordered a 8.5. They fit as expected. I was a little off-put by there being no stretch when you put your foot in the shoe (I don't like to fight to put on a shoe). It was not a problem at all. I like the insoles. I had food surgery and decided to put these on and see how they worked for me. I've had them on all day and they are super comfy. I'll be ordering some in other colors. I'll work out in them tomorrow.,5,1,28.0
"I purchased this sneaker in a 7 men size because I am a 8.5 in woman size. The sneaker still has a little too much room, so I ended up giving it to my daughter. It fits her perfect. I just ordered a 6.5, hopefully it works out.sneakers are definitely comfortable. The cushion inside is like memory foam. While running it felt good on my feet. I have no problem except with the size, its a little off for me.",4,1,28.0
"I have been spending some time in hospitals lately and I have seen hospital staff wearing these so I figured they are good for walking and standing. I started asking people wearing them what they thought and everyone was positive so I bought a pair. True sizing. If you wear a 13 in Nike, you wear a 13 in these. They are light and give adequate support while standing and walking but I really don’t trust the souls to hold up running every day.

I have had lots of compliments on the looks of these shoes and one guy asked me if they were custom made because he had never seen anything like them. When I told him that he could get them on Amazon for less than $50, he was floored.

Bottom line, they are worth the money. A set of good insoles would make them a little better but they are good as is really, as long as you’re not expecting high performance for the low price. Great for walking and casual wear.",4,1,28.0
The same box is used for all shoe sizes and there is no label or marking on the shoe to confirm what size it is. I ordered a 12 but it was more like a 13 or 14. Can’t trust these no-name shoes. And price went up when i tried to order a smaller size.,1,0,28.0

"Ok, if you ask me for the looks I might give it 5 star, it definitely looks “cool!�?Though it’s pitch bright white , when I walk out I feel I’m going to get all weird attention lol.
Anyways, coming to comfort , it’s not comfort at all. It’s damn heavy for a shoe, I feel like I’m walking with a rock on my leg. Plus it doesn’t feel comfortable. Though it’s hard to expect quality of Nike or Adidas from a cheap product like this. Though after buying this I have rarely used it because every time I think about wearing it I feel why in the world I bought this.",1,0,28.0
"You will get what you pay for. I didn’t want to spend $200 on a pair of Nike, so I went with this Just So So. The name is aptly given. There is no support, the sole of the shoe is not even, so your foot ends up shifting inward, and the design of the rubber undercarriage pushes through the sole of the shoe when you bend your foot too much. If you’re planning on buying this shoe to wear running, or for long walks, don’t. My Havaianas are more comfortable than this shoe.",3,0,28.0
"I love these shoes. I bought 3 pair of them in black and white, camp blue and green, and beige and orange. Each of them fit perfectly with no issues with them in quality. I have been rocking these pretty much everyday and after breaking them in I can tell you that these may be my favorite shoes from just comfort alone. I would compare them to my adidas boost shoes from both comfort and design. I have had plenty of people now complimenting me on them and have had them ask where I got them from. Everyone is always surprised when I tell them they are on Amazon for $40, but it’s the truth! I even had someone assume these costed me $400 before I told them how much they cost me. These shoes are crazy fam! I highly recommend them to anyone that’s looking into buying a pair. I am a 245 lb black man and I wear these everyday now. Get em!",5,1,28.0
"I ordered these again making sure the system had the correc size input. I wear. 8 in women’s so I got a size 6.5 in men’s. It fits great! It has a lot of cushion and space around my toes and ball of my feet which are medium width. It’s deign is of breathable material allowing air to pass through the shoe better than a regular shoe. It�?feels well built for running, and has a very stylish look. I think it’s great! I personally feel People with feet problems like swelling MIGHT benefit from the flexibility and breath ability of the shoe. it’s very stylish and flexible for athletes.",5,1,28.0
I wear a size 10 in about all my shoes. The 10's were snug but im still happy. They feel kinda cheap and the bottom of the shoe is 10x heavier than the top so they are kinda awkward just to hold lol. The insides of the shoe have this sort of cushion addition only to like the balls of your toes and under your arch so it feels really weird on your feet but after a while you get used to it. For like 30 bucks I thought these were really cool and worth the price but yes they do feel like 15 dollar shoes. Id probably still but a different pair just bcz i like the style and price.,4,1,28.0
"Because of a mistake I ended up with this pair and a pair from another seller. Comparing the two made this pair the greatest buy ever! Now, on their own: they feel great. The laces are decoration and the support comes from a sock type snug. But i wouldn't recommend trail runs or anything like that. It's not that snug. Update after 2 months: soles sank, uncomfortable, threw away. I by these were the best of several I've seen, but still not a good buy. Cheap, will fall apart.",2,0,28.0
"Love the simple tech style, the color, Seems like a good product to try. Shipment was fast! But where the heck are the in-soles? I wasn't told I needed to buy in-soles when I ordered these. They came this morning yet, I can't wear them. Either the packer didn't check or these are defective! I'm kind of disappointed but fortunately trust Amazon's customer protection. I will be returning this untouched. Hope they won't ship it to someone else.",1,0,28.0
My husband called me livid bcz these shoes were killing his feet after about a mile and a half (21mins) of his 3 mile walk! Luckily he had a pr of his pegasus in the truck. Even though he was wearing an insole this shoe rubbed a sore spot on the balls of his feet that's going to prevent him from walking or bike riding for a few days. If you are a serious runner/walker this is not a good shoe for you! Colors be damned it's about comfort and the shoe is definitely not supposed to cause injury to your feet. This is the definition of false advertising bcz these shoes do NOT perform as advertised. BUYER BEWARE!!,1,0,28.0
"I returned this simply because the shoe says Just So So but also in smaller print sets something about 400lbs ( seemed more like something that should be on a label and not stitched into the shoe, how has none mentioned this?) These shoes were for my 17 year old and he would not wear them with that writing stitched on the shoe. Looked good otherwise. He never tried them on so I am not certain of the fit. Make sure you don't mind the weird writing on the shoe before you purchase.",3,0,28.0
"The shoe is very colorful (obviously). It is very easy to put on but the shoe laces are somewhat difficult to tighten. This shoe is probably not good for running because of the distance between the ground and the bottom of your feet - - you could easily twist an ankle. I also am concerned about how fast the bottom of the shoe wears. If it wears too much, the ""X"" construction would quickly deform.",4,1,28.0
"I LOVE THESE SHOES - I am in healthcare and wear scrubs all the time - I am constantly running so when I came across this brand the reviews were outstanding so I figured I would give them a try for $40 one cant go wrong and plus the variety of colors helped to - though these are men shoes - I wear a size 8.5 in ladies so my conversion was a 6.5 in men's- I have had these shoes for about 2 months now and they are very comfortable- I get more compliments with these shoes then I do with my Nike Airs - the only concern is they do run about a 1/2 size to big however still very comfortable - I am going to order the red, white, and gray - the look just like the expensive sneakers out there - love them",5,1,28.0
Have only worn these a couple of times. I wear 11.5 Nike’s. Got these in 11 first and they were too small. Returned them and got 12’s. They are a little big but not so much. A 11.5 would be perfect by they are not offered. These are heavier than my Nike running shoes but they are pretty comfortable. I got a lot of compliments at the gym for how they look. For $42 shipped I figured I would give them a try. Happy so far. Will have to see how they hold up.,4,1,28.0
"i normally wear only Nikes, but thought id try these. bought the female size which is an 8, I usually wear 8 1/2 in womens this was the neon yellow. I also purchased the mens size , I usually wear a 6 1/2 in mens and I got the size 6 1/2 which was the greenish pair. I really loved how the mens fit more comfortably. Ive worked at my job for 25 years and walk on concreate floors for 12 to 13 hours a day.",5,1,28.0
"I really like these. For under $50 these shoes are worth it. I will be buying these again in a different color. I do consider myself kind of a sneaker head, i do abuse my shoes and i treat my shoes well; with that said i do see how if you are hard on these shoes they will wear down quickly. Id say light use for them for sure, walking is perfectly fine jogging might be pushing it, semi comfortable.",5,1,28.0
Just So So made me wake up! These are amazing from variety in colors to the quality. I stepped into a cushioned cloud. I planning on wearing these to work. Standing on my feet over 12hours plus. Let me tell you these shoes are a must have. I ordering a pair for me and my son to match. Yes they even carry little kids sizes as well. Normally I wear a size 10 in women and h wide feet. The shoe fit great and true to size. What are you waiting on add them to your cart and checkout!!!!!,5,1,28.0
"I have basically had all of the brand name over $100 shoes/sneakers and let me say, and I'm not exaggerating, these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet. Hard to find size 13 first of all but I am so happy with these shoes. They look like $150 shoes and feel like pillows. I will be buying more. Awesome product and thank whoever made these!!!!",5,1,28.0
"The look and feel of these shoes are amazing. I spend a great deal of time on my feet and usually shoes do not last me very long before they start to flatten out and I start to literally walk out of them. These still feel like I just bought them.

Update: After 5 months of normal (no working) use the anti-slip rubber covering on the bottom has started to tear off and hangs down. It is extremely thin and appears to be held on by a very small amount of glue along the inside edge. I was hoping to get at least 8 months to 1 year out of these, so, I removed 1 star.",4,1,28.0
"For the price I figured what the heck.
Not a bad shoe at all. I usually wear a size 10 in Adidas and Nike so I ordered size 10. They fit perfectly. They look great and are super comfortable. They’re not as light as your typical running shoe however they’re not super heavy either. “Somewhere in between�?I found the extra long pull tab that wraps around the back of the shoe not necessarily at all so I cut it off and singed with a lighter so it wouldn’t Frey. “Picture posted�?I’ll come back in six months and give an update.",4,1,28.0
"I ordered these, to replace the shoes my son had outgrown. I had ordered a size 8 and he actually needed an 8.5-9, but that is an issue with not trying on shoes before buying, so it was a miscalculation on my end.

"My first pair of walking shoes, switching from skate shoes, my feet I think are mainly adjusting to them from what I’m used to. But I wouldn’t wear these if you stand still for somewhat long periods of time. I work in retail and the aren’t that comfortable to just stand in. But if you are moving consistently they are pretty good. After 2 days of owning them I walked a mile of backwoods terrain and very steep inclines. Overall these are worth the money, they don’t really have much of a break in like other shoes, it’s pretty nice. But like I said I’m adjusting from flat skate shoes so my opinion may differ from others. So short term ownership I’d overall say they are good. I have a little wider feet than average and they fit pretty well, they do have stretch and do the job of a walking shoe. I would at this point buy again but waiting on the longevity and durability of these. I can say my feet don’t hurt nearly as bad at the end of a 8-10+ hour work day so I’m satisfied thus far.",5,1,28.0

"I don't think it's a bad shoe for what you pay for. Quite comfortable and good bargain. However, I would not suggest going on any kind of trail where there are brush and thick weeds. I stepped on a small dry weed on my land and the twig went through the shoe and into my sock. But mt reflexes were fast enough to keep the twig from penetrating my skin. I tried to pull it out by cutting the sole open and it's there to stay. Nice shie but not safe to wear around small sticks and things. Be careful.",3,0,28.0
I wear a 10/11 in womens and I feel like womens tennis shoes look huge on me so I bought the mens shoe in white and in black which would be a 9/10. In other brands always try to go with a mens 9.5 just so I will be comfortable in the shoe and feel like I my shoes don't look super long. I ended up with the mens 10 which is a little big on me. I'm going to keep them for now (I still have time to return them as of writing this) however if I knew I could go down a half size I would definitely exchange them. Overall they are a confortable shoe and I've gotten quite a few complements in them.,4,1,28.0
So I stay away from shoes and clothes on Amazon. Mostly because they don’t look as described. But these look awesome. Feel awesome and fit ok. The run .5 size bigger. So the 11 actually fit like a 11.5 on me.,5,1,28.0

For not being a brand that people can identify with in the US, I get quite a few compliments everywhere I go with them on and its no joke.

Very happy with my purchase and I wear them most of the time over my other brand shoes.",4,1,28.0
These shoes are nice to look at even thought they look like boats on your feet. They are crap shoes. I didnt even get 3 months use out of them walking to and from my car and while inside the gym. Never ran in them and still they began fall apart. The sole as you can see just came unglued. No way was l going to waste my time trying to glue them back together. What a waste of of $40. Poor customer service too. Contact Amazon directly they said. And there's a restocking fee if you want to return them so you only get a partial refund.,2,0,28.0

Some people got a bad pair, the bottom broke, someone’s skin on their heel was peeling, etc etc. I work in the plant that builds cars, I haven’t had a bad experience with these shoes.

Just So So’s are more comfortable than them and I’ve been using the soles that come with these shoes. I would still recommend buying an insole for them though. And I guess some of those people wearing them that got the skin on their heel peeling was probably because they didn’t wear socks! I would highly recommend these shoes because they’re comfortable, true to size, perfect fit, great support and you can’t beat the price. You’re not supposed to wear the same shoe everyday anyway so having a few of these would be ideal. I love them.",5,1,28.0

I had to put inserts in them to make them comfortable. I'm to invest in some Dr Scholls to make them perfect.",4,1,28.0
My husband honestly bought these shoes because he thought they were the most obnoxiously ugly shoes he could find. When he wears them. EVERYONE compliments him on them. Everybody else things they are really cool shoes.,5,1,28.0
I was excited for these shoes. Honestly didn’t like the feel of them. They threw off my whole foot causing extreme pain. I worked out in them one time and now my Plantar Fasciitis has been ignited! They are the worst purchase I’ve ever made and has been sitting in their box never to be worn again…I wish I could get every penny back. Never again and I’ve been discouraging others from getting them as well.,1,0,28.0
"I absolutely love the way these shoes look. Super stylish, and very flattering! People ask me about them every time I wear them. Definitely draw a lot of attention.
As a factory worker, I do not recommend these as your everyday shoe without supportive inserts. The bottoms are hard plastic, not springy, and has no give.
Great for casual wear!",4,1,28.0
"The sizes are inconsistently sized but they are beautiful and comfortable...
My youngest daughter has a pair that are fading but I'm not certain on why that is. I've purchased 3 for myself and don't have any problems aside from having to return 3 different times to get the correct size.
That's annoying but I have back issues so I have to keep trying to get it right.",4,1,28.0
"I got many compliments from these sneakers. I have SKECHERS sneakers and these are more comfortable than them. Feet feel very rested and they just feel good. I am definitely going to buy a few more pairs of them and they come in a great range of colors. You will not regret the purchase.

I wear orthotics as well as I am flat footed and these are great shoes!",5,1,28.0
"They look really good but thats about it. If you are looking for something comfortable-for walking, running etc these are not it. They are good for maybe going to the mall, starbucks, simple stuff as they look nice however for anything else they are just not comfortable. They are as hard as a rock.",3,0,28.0
The shows are beautiful. The only issue I had was that they were way too big. I ordered an 11 which is my normal size in a regular shoe. However these shoes are very wide so even with my wide size 11’s I was walking out of the shoe lol. Unfortunately I had to return them but I do intend to order them again a size down.,4,1,28.0
"Wear these to work & walk a lot. Ordered 2 pair. The blue camo pair has already started separating from sole to uppers. My tennis ball green pair is fine. Sure would like to be able to talk to someone or find out how to contact seller. Only had these 3 months. I hope this was just a defect in a single pair, not for all of them.",2,0,28.0
"My husband (the one actually writing the review) happen to see these on Amazon. Looked pretty cool. Read the reviews (good & bad) and decided to give a shot. I wasn’t disappointed. They looked as they did in the pics and are surprisingly comfortable.
The only things I will criticize are: 1) even though they are comfortable, they could use a little more padding for the insoles. 2) fit well from the heel to the balls of my feet but are quite roomy from the balls to the tips of the toes. I tightened them up as much as I could. It helped a little but bunched up a bit on the top of the shoe above the toes. 3) they are slippery on hard floors when wet, and 4) a little heavier than I’m used to but I would consider getting a second pair.",4,1,28.0
Bought these for a friend. He wears 9.5 or 10. He got the 10 and they fit exact. Very soft on the insole as well. They look exactly as the pictures. Hope they last long. But they were a great buy,5,1,28.0
"Was kinda skeptical after reading the reviews, but I had to try for myself. I needed a pair of really good sneakers. Well baby, let me tell you; these sneakers are so comfortable! They feel like I'm walking on clouds! I definietly are AMAZING!!!! You won't be disappointed in purchasing them, you just have to see for yourself! I'll be purchasing another pair soon, just have to figure out what color I want to get!",5,1,28.0
"Don't like that loop in the back; almost 1.5"" loops out from the shoe. Extra height with the heel which I do not need; I'm 6'2"" tall. I'm a woman.
No support, you'll have to add your own support. I just wanted a normal wear shoe... store, bank, and grocery shopping.
Color is great.

I need more width, even in the shoe lace area. Hard to spread the shoe to get my foot in.",3,0,28.0
"They looked great right out of the box. I was so excited to get them. But I could not put them on. I have Fred Flintstone feet, wide and flat. These shoes don't have enough give in them for me to put them on. :( Instead of going through the hassle of returning them, I will be gifting them to a friend for his birthday.",3,0,28.0
"They look really cool but that’s about it. Very uncomfortable for me personally, I’m in the military and used these for PT in the morning for long runs and they absolutely suck. I threw them away not gonna lie.

You get what you pay for, but don’t take my word for it lol, you’ll find out if you make the same mistake I did",1,0,28.0
"Update: 10/5/2019. 30 days out from buying these shoes. Only worn them 2 1/2 weeks. Already showing moderate wear on soles. Uber beware. Subpar shoes. Not worth the price. See photos.

Original review: This is the first time buying shoes online without trying in first. I don’t recommend that practice. I like the look of the shoe. The length is ok, but it fits snug for the size. I have custom inserts and when I removed the insert that comes with the shoe to fit my insert, I notice in the left shoe that some of the stitching was subpar and already breaking before wearing. I will be surprise if these last a month. I will be visiting a shoe store soon to purchase a different pair to have on standby.",3,0,28.0
"OK so these shoes are so freaking comfortable but now I'm at a crossroads. the whole front of the shoe separated from the sole on my second adventure and now is a major trip hazard. Defeating the whole purpose of it being a trail runner and now more like an I'm going to go take the trash out in my new bright green shoes shoe.... Hopefully, someone sees this and can help me out, would really like a new pair but don't want to cop out the money for a pair of hospital slippers",2,0,28.0
"After having these shoes for 4-5 months, the rubber sole is essentially GONE and down to plastic structure of the shoe. I should add that I am not on my feet all day, the building I work in has epoxy floors so I am not walking on a rough floor all day long. Aside from the sole of the shoe not lasting very long, after a day of wearing these shoes I can't wait to take them off.
I will absolutely not be buying another pair of these ever again.",2,0,28.0
"Well can't beat the comfort..ordered two more for my other half. But there were problems..why I didn't give 5 stars. The packaging in plastic bag which the shoes came crushed.
I also noticed visible glue on the shoe.
Yes..could have returned them but when my other half (who stands all day at a supermarket helping people in this pandemic ) says comfortable..believe me the word ""comfort"" is not taken lightly.",3,0,28.0
"The shoe has very minimal support, so I wouldn't recommend it for any kind of cardio/ running situation. I love how vibrant the red is; very rich color pay off. The shoe runs true to size, so you more than likely wont need to size up or down. I can see the glue that holds the shoe together, so i'm not sure how long it'll last. However, I'll enjoy it while it lasts.",3,0,28.0
bought these for the wife and she absolutely loves them. They are lightweight and supportive. She has had a very hard time finding shoes that work for longer than a week and so far she is going on a month with no issues and still prefers them over her high dollar support shoes.,5,1,28.0
"This is shoe is good for working out in a gym or brief circuit training. A wide ankle or foot is needed. (Primarily in the heel area)

I run 3+ miles a day outside. These were very harsh and started forming blisters along the sides of my feet. They felt more like a dress shoe. I guess this was due to the hard sole. I would recommend these shoes as ""house cats"" only. Not really an outdoor sports shoe.

If purchasing for style, go for it.",2,0,28.0
I typically wear a size 9 1/2 W. since there was no half sizes or Wides. I bought a 9 and a 10. The 9 was too small and the 10 was a tiny bit big. I kept the 10. Typically the same result I would’ve got in a brick and mortar store with no halves or wides. And it has a great look and feel. Seems well-made,5,1,28.0
"I am truly surprised by how much I like these shoes!! They took a long time to get here, and they were a month early so make sure you look at the arrival date. I ordered these shoes for work shoes, and I love them. I have only got to wear them a short amount of time but have probably had them on for at least 12 hours total. The packaging was just a clear bag but these are definitely worth the money.",5,1,28.0
"This pair of shoes looks good but why they have laces because they gives you hard time to get your foot into it without laces. Also short in size, I had experience in having shoes from Adidas, Reebok, Nike and asics and size 8-8.5 fit's perfect but in this pair 8.5 not able to get my foot into it even no laces. So, I was not able to use them and returned.",2,0,28.0
"Nothing special about them. They fit and feel good. The writing is a bit obnoxious, luckily it peels off. Started squeaking after about a week. The back of the heel is almost all worn down after 1 month. Update.. source of the squeak is a piece of sole broke.",3,0,28.0
"The shoes are esthetically appealing a FPS feel great. I usually purchase smaller when I buy men’s athletic shoes but I went with 7 and need a 7.5. The 7 fits just right, but I have no room at the toe which is usually advised when purchasing workout shoes. I plan to wear them while working on the warehouse floor. Returning for a 7.5.
Oh no....no 7.5",5,1,28.0
"Honestly one of my favorite running shoes for $100 or less. They are great for running, I am training for a half marathon with them. However for walking around my feet had to adjust to the bumps, and support in the shoe. I don't know if it's the way I walk, but for the first month that I used them not when running a pressure point in my foot kept hurting to the point I had to walk to avoid putting my toes on the ground. After a while that pain doesn't appear again so I guess my foot is used to it. All together a great show for running and I get a lot of compliments for them which is nice too!",4,1,28.0
Good looking I get compliments on them all the time. I was hoping they would be a bit squishier since i have nerve problems in my feet. They offer NO ankle support so do not go hiking with them unless you want a twisted ankle. Almost happened to me. Also put in another insole seems to help so you may want to do that. Overall for the price I can't complain.,4,1,28.0
"I order my regular size but after reading alot of reviews. I decided to order the next half size up. But when I got them they where actually too big so I had to return them for my size in order in men. I am so happy with all 3 pair that I purchase. I ordered the red in men size 8, the blue and orange in women size 9.5 ( I had to up.in half size in the women though)",5,1,28.0
"These shoes look cool [in photos], but they are cheaply-made, heavy, and stiff. They don't offer any cushion. The sole and heel are rigid, stiff plastic. None of it is foam. They feel like they'd injure your feet or knees if you wore them for any high-impact workouts. The joining between the fabric and the plastic sole is sloppily glued on. I'm returning them and leaving a review to save someone else some time. Don't bother.",1,0,28.0
"I really love these shoes. I'm a nurse and on my feet all day. These are actually the first pair of shoes I've had that my feet, knees, and back isn't hurting when I get off my 12hr shift. It's difficult to explain because they don't have that soft inner cushion on the inside of the shoe like most other shoes. But yet they are really comfortable to my feet. I end up ordering 2 more pair.",5,1,28.0
"This is my third pair of finally getting the correct size, 9 in men turquoise color, few days ago ordered the yellow, after which I will order a red pair. I have all these expensive sneakers by Nike and I will probably wear these the most, everyone is already asking the band brand and where I purchased my son just ordered the black. I would definitely recommend...",5,1,28.0
"The week after they arrived the sole came off the shoe. I emailed the seller and they said to seek refund from Amazon. I will however say that for another 12 bucks, I did pick up the E6000 glue. So far this is holding up. But my son is not as active as usual due to an Achilles tendon injury. I can't i.agine what would have happened if he was active as he usually is. I will never buy from this seller again. Buy the E6000 glue thouh, this thing really works.",2,0,28.0
"I was hesitant on buying these ... price and the name looked sketchy... my little cousin had a picture on Instagram wearing them so i inquired and i bought these Friday. $42.99 no shipping fee!!!..lol got them Monday and wore them all day today and i am on cloud 9!.. very very comfortable. i felt like i could dunk on Lebron James or outrun Usain Bolt lol. Anyways. I recommend these. I plan on getting the black and white ones too, but yea this is proof never judge a book by its cover and to think i was about to spend $200 for some nike vapor max sneaks smh",5,1,28.0
"CONS: 1. Adhesive on the bottom-most layer of outer sole degraded from shuffling feet on rough surfaces.
2. My instep and feet are narrow, therefore, when I tighten my shoe, material bunches between the laces.

PROS: 1. Comfortable, even with the bunching. The mesh is very forgiving.
2. Good weighted shoe for walking and design supports heal-to-toe steps.

IMPROVE: 1. More arch support and snugness to aid those with narrow feet.",3,0,28.0
You wont go wrong with this purchase! They are hella comfortable. I wore them all day for my sons basketball tournament (as i stand most of the time) and they provided so much comfort all day compared to my nike air 270. I highly recommend these comfortable shoes. They also have nice padding inside of the shoes.,5,1,28.0
"As the women's only go up to 10.5 and I wear an 11-11.5ish. I bought men's in an 9 as I usually do when needing to convert from men to women's. Its a bit loose a, but comfortable and cheap enough for me to not hassle with a return. Just ordered a smaller pair so hopefully they will live up to the hype.",3,0,28.0
"Honestly, they feel clunky and look a little cheap.
They higher soles are good for wet and even slightly muddy conditions, as long as the shoe itself stays above.
Was a little disappointed, as I ended up buying a $14 pair of sneakers from Walmart that ended up much comfier and suited to actual use.",2,0,28.0
"Fits wide. There will be a noticeable fold along the right or left side/center when you tie the laces tight enough for the shoe not to slide around. That being said. If you just want some knock-around shoes for casual use (I use mine when I need to take the dog out), you can't beat the price. And they look pretty slick.",4,1,28.0
"Probably great for working out. I got mine for the comfort since I work on my feet for 12 hours. Had these about a month and, and the sides ripped open, and chunks of souls are missing. I do not recommend these shoes if you are going to use them daily for work. The creators of this shoe had banned me from leaving a bad review on their fb page. Not very trustworthy",1,0,28.0
"I tried using these shoes for work, but as a flat footer, these shoes made my back and knees hurt, I even tried putting insoles in them but it didn't work, but I can see how these shoes would be comfortable for people with healthy feet but definitely not for flat feet. They look cool, but they don't feel comforting.",3,0,28.0
"Not sure why so many people are giving this 5 stars and saying its amazing. The shoe is so so. They have hard soles that do not give that much. The shoe breathes well, but otherwise is just a good looking cheap shoe. If you need a budget shoe this is good for that. Otherwise if you are looking at getting good shoes, look elsewhere.",3,0,28.0
I wear these for indoor trade shows only....never outside and in only dry situations. After wearing a total of 25 times...these fell apart and at the sole and laces.....total failure and not worth the money for an business wear only. Crap product,4,1,28.0
These shoes were too tight and low quality. I could feel the plastic springs through the insole of shoe. After wearing them for 6 hours my feet hurt really bad. I wouldn't recommend. They look really nice though.,1,0,28.0
Shoes looked good were so so in the comfort but squeak really bad every time I take steps they squeak became so annoying I tossed the shoes its what I get for buying cheap Chinese goods.,1,0,28.0
"Definitely worth the price, and they are more comfortable than Nike believe it or not. The sole insert is like memory foam and had raised part to better mold to your feet. The sole itself is hard and firm which I like. The problem is there is no size anywhere on this shoe and they either send the wrong size or they runs a size big.",4,1,28.0
"A fellow RN recommended these shoes. In fact, a dozen of our staff began wearing these. I bought a pair, and the comfort/fit is great. Cost effective, and multiple colors/options for your choosing. Great arch support, and comfort. I am a 6'2"", male, 220# RN who works 12+ hour shifts. These shoes comforted and relieved my plantar fasciitis, and relieved my back spasms. Worth the purchase.",5,1,28.0
"The best thing I have done for my feet in years.
I walk around on a solid concrete floor 9-10 hrs per day at work.
I instantly felt the improvement the 1st day I wore these to work the next day after delivery.

Worth every penny and highly recommend these as work shoes.

I am buying another pair just for leisure.",5,1,28.0
Well I bought these shoes in April. It’s the end of June and the sole of the show has completely fell apart. I didn’t wear these everyday. I have shoes from 2010 that are still in good part. These were the only shoes I have ever bought that fell apart in less then 5 years.,2,0,28.0
"My shoes arrived a few days early, and I was ecstatic. The picture of the red ""just soso"" shoes advertised were exactly what I ordered. I normally wear a 9 & half wide with shoe, so I ordered a size 10. That was a great decision because these shoes fit my feet perfect! If you don't have a wide foot. It may be safe to order your normal size. Go buy these shoes!",5,1,28.0
"Runs very narrow. Hard to put on wide feet. Same for the kids version. Strap at heel was a bit too big so it looked odd. Aside from being tight and narrow, looked cool with the interesting sole. Message on shoe is odd though....says So So. Returned.",3,0,28.0
"Great shoes overall and very worth the purchase. They have style, comfort and support that not every sport shoe has with the padding inside. Perfect for running as it helps with thicker heels and almost a spring to each step. However, these wouldn’t be great everyday shoes to be wearing for 8+ hours. Reason being is because it does have tougher spots in the shoe that eventually make your feet hurt. Even with that being said, after taking them off and then putting them back on the next day for a workout, they feel comfortable all over again. At least for me. I’m conclusion, these shoes are great for what their purpose is. WORTH THE BUY!",5,1,28.0
"I like that it’s cheap. I can use it for yard work or fishing. Not as breathable as I thought it would be, kinda hot. They turned a couple heads from the crazy design, black tread on bottom started ripping off in 2 days. I’ve since completely coated them in mud as I use them as junk shoes now around the yard and crabbing and fishing and changing the oil on my car and stuff like that. I don’t recommend as a serious purchase. If you understand they are a cheap shoe and have plans for a cheap shoe then buy them.",3,0,28.0
"I have struggled with back pain for several years due to accident..These shoes really take quit a bit of that pressure off your spine..It is like walking on a fluffy cloud of air...Very comfortable,this is my second pair,one I wear for work and one for everyday wearing...Great Product..Thanks Jeff",4,1,28.0
"These shoes only look good. If you are wanting to break your legs and hips, buy them. They are extremely bad when wet. I have slipped so many times and these are already in trash and not worth the risk.",1,0,28.0
"I wore them to work everyone asked me if they are comfortable for standing a 10 hr shift ? No they are not but everyone loves the look of them . And when they are wet at the sole they squeak so damn loud ughhh smh so don’t walk in a white room with no carpet. Lol

For comfort I wouldn’t not recommend
For the off brand Nike look I would recommend!",3,0,28.0
"Bought them for walking and light jogging. Had them a week, so two walks and 3 runs of 4 miles each and the black rubber (if that is what it is) is going on the heals. Also you can see some bit worn mid. They are very stiff and the feel seemed tight. I was going to stay with them until I noticed the heals.",1,0,28.0
"Shoes look awesome but the comfort isn't there. If they would remove those bump pockets in the sole and added more of a gel/foam the shoes would feel comfortable, but honestly you can feel the hard rubber bottom. I couldn't imagine working with these all day on my feet",1,0,28.0
"the right foot is not comfortable it feels like you toe is stepping on a rock, there is no cushion.
I would not buy it again the only things I can say good is that looks nice but not enough for my feet. if something I have learned in my life is that you want to feel confer in your main body support ( your feet )",1,0,28.0
"Been wearing these shoes for about a good month, and notice the soles, the grips, the traction is gone. I wish I taken a picture to show you all, but I don't. I just know that the sole of the is almost gone completely. All I do is walk and run and I do more walking than running. Still, unless they make it better, sorry to say its not worth the money.",2,0,28.0
"Great price and looks really cool. But if you’re looking for a shoe that serves its main purpose- this doesn’t stand up. Its too heavy (compared to good brand running shoes), the base is all hard plastic and doesnt seem to have any shock absorbtion as the design seems. I think its best fir casual show off type events with minimal movement.",3,0,28.0
"These shoes are soooo freaking comfortable!!! I have a high arch and these are an awesome fit. They don't tell everybody you've arrived on a rainy day with all the squishy noise. One thing I would change is to add a thicker insole/cushion (even without adding, they're still perfect). Definitely getting a few more pairs🙃",5,1,28.0
"It fits pretty good for the most part, just a little tight around the small toe. I usually wear 10 1/2 W. I got the 10 because people said it ran big, and there is no 10/2 option. The 10 would fit perfect if it wasn't for how narrow the shoes are. They look great though and feel okay minus just being a little cramped at the end.",4,1,28.0
"I ordered these for my fiance because he goes through so many shoes. He is a delivery driver and he is constantly on his feet. Well, he's obsessed! His first impression of them, not going to lie, he was a bit skeptical because of the support in them. Well let me tell you, I ended up buying a pair and Ive never felt anything like it it any shoe! So comfortable! When he gets home, he's not complaning that his feet are hurting. These are legit! So legit that we are both buying a second pair.",5,1,28.0
"Nothing to dislike......my arch is high so I use a shoe horn to put most of my shoes: the manufacturers for this product have included a strap on the heel to help seating my foot into this shoe. Good idea....they are extremely light and comfortable,.I am very satisfied with this purchase.",5,1,28.0
Soles ware fast. Have been wearing for about a week and a half and the heal is almost bald already. Yes they are cheap so its expected i guess. Also they are very narrow i dont use wide sizes but i would with this brand. Otherwise great sneaks,3,0,28.0
I wanted to love these shoes but I can't. The look and color are great but don't be treated; there's no support and not good for working out. I purchased man size instead of woman because they ran small and narrow; well guys are the opposite. The make of the shoe seems good but the build is off; if you're still going to buy then just know you'll need some type of insert to support your feet.,2,0,28.0
With all the positive reviews here I thought I'd take a chance on these. I wear a size 12 and struggled getting them on with the integrated sock style. I wore them for one day and they were so uncomfortable that I can't wear them again. I bought them for the looks and learned my lesson.,2,0,28.0
"Definitely won’t buy this product again but you get what you pay for. One of my friends had a pair and they look amazing, which is why I rated a 3 star, but they are noe comfortable at all.

I am a female Registered Nurse with really big (size 12) and somewhat wide feet. I’ve struggled over the years to find shoes that fit properly and were comfortable. Every pair of shoes I’ve ever bought either fit properly OR felt ok but never both. These shoes are the perfect fit AND they’re super comfortable. If you’ve had the same struggles do yourself a favor and give these a try. You won’t regret it!,5,1,28.0
"These shoes are comfortable for walking or exercising but not for standing long periods of time. I work part time at Amazon and had to put insoles in for added comfort. They also seem to stretch a bit after continuous wear. Other than that, very cute colors and fashionable.",4,1,28.0
"Love these shoes they are very comfortable. As soon as put them on I knew I had to buy 2 more pairs. I recommend anyone that have foot problems or want some comfortable shoes to walk , run or excercise in. These shoes are the one for you",5,1,28.0
"These shoes are very comfortable even with my size 13EE foot.

Pro:
Comfortable.
Actually fit my foot (once I get my foot past the opening).
Very well vented.

Con:
Difficult to get foot in.
Rubber sole started to detach day one ( super glue solved problem).
Longevity is Doubtful.

Rated four stars just for comfort alone.",4,1,28.0
"Very nice shoe, comfortable fit once you are able to squeeze your feet into them! Not sure why the opening is so small?? One thing for sure is they ain’t coming back off without muscle. Maybe shoe stretchers will fix this for me!",4,1,28.0
"The shoe has no traction the bottoms are very slippery I stepped on a little water outside walked inside and almost fell, but I was able to catch myself thank God. After I Caught myself I started walking again and slipped again and fell. So I took the shoes off and started to return to Amazon. They refunded my money with no problem. I do not recommend these shoes because they are not safe for walking inside even if you have the slightest amount of water on the bottom of your shoe you will slip and possibly fall like I did.",1,0,28.0
The shoes have no arch support. They are very uncomfortable. They're too big for me but was hard to get my foot in the shoe if that makes sense... Cute shoe but it has the quality of the shoes you'd get at a local beauty supply store. Just my opinion...,2,0,28.0
"My goodness. They look like theu would be great for a workout but opposite. You feel everything. After a 30 minute walk on the track, I was feeling it. Also, the shoe says it for itself... : ""Just so so"" I kid not. The weiring on the shoes is pretty random with numbers in places and on yhe side it says just so so! Ha",2,0,28.0
Not bad value. I use them for walking and weigh 205 pounds. Would like to have more inner sole padding with better arch support and more impact shock dampening. Nice looking and good build quality. They are perfectly fine for tourist strolling.,3,0,28.0

"Looks great however these are casual wear shoes, they are not for running/working out. I wear size 11 and am 185lbs, wore them for a run and turned around after a mile as there is no heel support, put on my nikes for training, these for hanging out with the kids around the house",2,0,28.0

shoe was just slightly larger than expected but not a huge problem since I like to slip my shoes on and off. I mainly use these shoes for casual wear and have gotten lots of compliments on the style and color. I've only worked out in them once but I had no comfort issues. I caught these on sale for $29 because I wear a size 13 but they are worth the deal I got for sure.,4,1,28.0
These shoes are as beautiful on the website as it is in person.. I love these shoe and the color is to die for..🥰🥰 the comfort is amazing wouldn’t lie.. the next best shoe to puma because puma is my favorite.. and now these shoes is my 2nd favorite..,5,1,28.0
For 46.00 you can’t go wrong with these sneakers. The styles are spot on and the quality of construction is great. You put a swoosh on these and you pay 150.00 to 200.00. As a sneaker collector I know a good quality sneaker. I’ve already bought 2 more pairs for my wife.,5,1,28.0
"These shoes are very comfortable and they draw a lot of attention! I’ve never had so many compliments on my sneakers! Be leery of purchasing these shoes from some other vendors here on Amazon because, I found out the hard way, some are not quality at all! This is a trusted vendor!",5,1,28.0
If you are getting Size 13 they are going to be tight for you at the beginning because you need a break a man they do feel a little weird in the bottom that’s just because they have that opening but these are great for walking and running shoes the only problem that I have with them is that they don’t go bigger and wider that’s the only problem,5,1,28.0
"Love these shoes. So comfortable . I walk every morning with no problem.
Lots of compliments. I'm a size 8 but bought the 6.5 in men.
Will be ordering more in different colors.

Update ordered 2 more pair. They are great.",5,1,28.0
"I read the negative reviews, but I wanted these to match an outfit. I have pronation in my ankles. These sneakers are made such that they encourage pronation based upon the way they are manufactured. Also, there is a bubble in the inside of the sole that pops up and down when one walks. Just too flimsy for the money. Buyer beware.",1,0,28.0
So far so good fit perfect comfortable I have flat feet for a woman I'm also tall so it makes my feet big so I got a 12 men because I wear a 13 in women these shoes are very comfortable I can't wait to buy more I think I want the gray and the yellow ones next,5,1,28.0
"tennis totalmente piratas, sin ninguna etiqueta ni siquiera el numero del calzado. talla mal por lo mismo que son falsos. compre dos pares y los dos los devolvi. no se como Amazon se presta para estas cosas. deprimente en serio",1,0,28.0
"I purchased these as strictly walking shoes. 5'9"" 170lbs. After two months of warm dry climate and never been wet, the left shoe has developed a ""squeak"" in the heel somewhere. Every step equals a loud squeak. The other issue is the lettering is starting to peel off the shoe. If I was still in the window to return or exchange I would.

Nice shoe, fits and feels comfortable, but at this price there are going to be tradeoffs. Lifespan being the biggest.",3,0,28.0
"Did me well for the airport! Tremendous amounts of walking & I love them! I ordered a half size up, usually in men’s I wear a 7.5 so I ordered an 8 & they are perfect!! Of course without socks don’t curse me lol but these details are necessary for your order I say do it",5,1,28.0
The sneakers are heavy. Granted yes they are men's sneakers. I thought they would be a little lighter in weight since they are tailored for workouts and active wear. Dope design. So do we have more of a cushion inside the sneaker but now that I I'm aware that the same design sneaker is sold in women's I'm more inclined to purchase another pair but women's sizes.,3,0,28.0
"The insert is super weird with random raise points, overall uncomfortable and stiff.",2,0,28.0

"Based on some press and reviews on this site I was expecting a great priced ‘unicorn�?performance shoe that would rival Asics, Nike, ardidas, etc. these do not. They are no way close. On the flip side - they are not a horrible shoe for the price. These are $42 shoes. Equivalent to the lowest level shows from ASICS, Nike, etc.",2,0,28.0
"I’ve had these for a few weeks now. With all honesty the shoe looks nice, but for 40 dollars unfortunately you are not getting the top notch technology for support and comfortability. When you walk, you feel the stuff under your feet, it’s like something is stabbing your feet. I believe that if there was more layers in between the sole and the foot this shoe would be great. Unfortunately I have realized that when it comes to great comfortable shoe it’s better to spend the 120-200 dollars to have a shoe like Hoka that will last you a few years and feel amazing under your feet. My advice don’t cheap out, spend the extra money get a hoka or On Cloud.",3,0,28.0
"I love these style and brand shoes. I Now have three (3) pair: these yellow , a green and a turquoise pair. Next time is the red pair. The only draw back. You just about have to get some arch support insoles for these.",5,1,28.0
"I thought these shoes were going to be awesome and they still do look awesome, but wtf...they have ""just so so"" written on the side and back! In the photos everything is reversed and I thought the words were all backwards an different which was cool. This was the main reason I bought them!! Regardless, I'm still going to wear them, but hopefully I don't get laughed at with them reading ""just so so"" on the side and back. Really dumb words to choose for a shoe. They need to reverse the print or put their brand on them or something.",2,0,28.0
I love the feel when you’re wearing the shoe. Very comfortable inside. I bought these shoes to wear for lots of physical activity and running. Bad idea. I ran maybe three 1/2mile laps on a rubber track and the rubber on the sole of the shoe is already ripping off. There is very little rubber on the sole so it will wear very quickly. As for the fancy open sole design I was assuming it was rubber so there would be a bounce in the step. Unfortunately it’s all plastic. It flexes but under a lot of pressure as if you forced the shoe to fold in half. So be aware of that. But other than that the shoe would be a very good fashion shoe. Lots of compliments my first time wearing. But not very good for working out at all.,2,0,28.0
These shoes are so bright they will blind you in the light. My husband got a lot of compliments on the shoes because of the brightness of the color. They do get dirty easily but it all comes out in the wash with OxiClean. We will be buying the other colors as well.,5,1,28.0
"These are some awsome athletic shoes,light weight,easy on and off.BEAUTIFULY structured and colored.Have had so many compliments on their style that after purchasing myself a pair,my daughter throws a lil sad face at me wanting herself a pair. They come in so many colors, you can wear the same type of shoe daily, just change the colors to match practically anything. My sons birthday is the 8th,he wants them for his daily running shoe.The whole family will be sporting these stylish,comfortable kicks...Thanks Amazon,AGAIN!!!",5,1,28.0
Good running shoe but it gets very messy if you run or walk over muddy areas. All dirt gets stuck between the holes below and you better shake it or rinse it before you get home and THAT TAKES TIME! so far good comfortable running shoe,4,1,28.0
"Same size as Nikes.
Awesome shoe for the price.
Due to the soles construction, with hard use parts of the soul will start to peel it can be easily repaired with shoe Goo stronger than are the manufacturers. For the price you can't beat it it's like wearing slippers all day with a spring in your step.",5,1,28.0
"I have two pairs of these for myself. Love them. Bought a pair for my teenage son his broke in about a month! Maybe the larger size doesn’t hold up as good!? I’m a size 8 or 6 in men’s and he is a size 11.5 in men.
Mine are still good and I wear them daily.",2,0,28.0
"I use these for my walks/workouts. I cant believe how good these are for the price. Probably going to order another pair. They are comfortable, they look really good. Yes they have some weird writing on the side so I wouldn't wear them at a public gathering where people may try and reads what it says (it's nonsense basically), but other than that, theyre fine.",5,1,28.0
"I bought these in men size 6.5, because they didnt have an 8.5 in women. I know to buy a 7 in men next time. these fit exactly. I am going t keep these, but the next pair I order will be a men size 7.",5,1,28.0
Very attractive shoe. After a few months of use I noticed the shoes began squeaking on certain flooring like linoleum. Been also using on bike rides and they perform well. The fit is a little loose. Unable to adjust to a tighter support as the shoe doesn’t not have that extra eyelet to perform a heel lock. I ordered 11 and next time I’ll have to order 10 or 10 1/2,4,1,28.0
"Awesome shoes but they fit too tight. Reading reviews, people mentioned go with your true size so I ordered a size 13. I might go a size up next time. The bottom start peeling after making a few cuts while playing with the youth in a local mall. Nothing superglue can fixed but it shouldn’t happened. Not complaining due to the price for an stylish okay/comfortable shoe.",3,0,28.0

"I love everything about the shoe, just wish they didn’t squeak the way they do. I’ve only had them a week! They look great and are also pretty comfortable. Would easily be a 5 star if it wasn’t for the squeak, not sure if I got a defective pair or what the deal is. Considering buying a different color just to see if they also squeak the same way.",3,0,28.0
I purchased this shoes to play basketball. Played 4 games of bball to 15. by the end I had all kinds of trouble with plantar fascia. If you want to destroy your feet this product will do just that in a short period of time. terrible product avoid buying or using at all costs. not even worth free.,1,0,28.0
"Got these for my 10 year old. His feet are growing so fast and I didn't want to spend a lot on new shoes. Definitely expected them to last more than 27 days though. That's how long it took for them to snap and have the bottom rip off. That's not even 27 days of usage, that's 27 days of ownership. He only wore them 10x.",3,0,28.0
"I have gotten so many compliments on these shoes ever since I started wearing them to work. With driving a forklift and standing on concrete floors 10 hours a day, I needed good supportive shoes and these definitely fit the bill. However today I noticed the bottom of the shoes started separating and I've only had and worn them for about 2 weeks. Even with them being a cheaper shoe I expected them to hold up better than this. I could have gone to Walmart or Target if I wanted shoes that would do that in such a short time span.",3,0,28.0
"The reason for my three star review is, the first pair of shoes we received came apart after a week of light wear. We returned them (painless process) for another pair and so far so good with durability. My son likes the shoe and says their comfortable.",3,0,28.0

Wish they would make 1/2 sizes past 13! I wear them without socks!! Also they have good insoles but not for my gait! I pronate! I ordered some for me!! I’ll update when I do my 1st workout",5,1,28.0
Have had the shoes as a daily shoes and work shoes and workout shoes and they're pretty good just like their name there so so They are easy to clean Easy to put on however the bottom grip on the shoes wear out in disappear way too quickly I have had these shoes for 4 months and The grip is already I was worn out,4,1,28.0
At first was great for working out and everyday use but the stitching/flue around soles started coming undone after use. I caught it early so maybe some glue can help but for everyday use dont expect them to last long,3,0,28.0

Purchased several pair for my son. They look nice and he says they are very comfortable. He is on his feet all day so that says a lot. Very satisfied with this purchase.,4,1,28.0
"I really like the comfort and colors of these sneakers, my only concern is why they would choose to write just so so on the side of the shoes. I originally thought who cares but after wearing them I'm not really pleased with it. They are also running larger than expected",4,1,28.0
"I was really reluctant to order these. However, these have exceeded my expectations. Therefore, I would recommend these! I have gotten compliments and people asking where I got them on a daily basis. They are really helping with my lower back as well, which is the reason I got them.",5,1,28.0
"Bought them for work. The fit is really good. I have wide feet and they fit great for that. Maybe need a new insoles, because I “think�?the ones these have might not be good for very long. Am happy with my purchase!!",4,1,28.0
"The bottom of the shoe started coming unglued.

There is also thin / limited padding around the heel, so you start to feel the structure of the sole.

All this after a week of use. You can tell by the picture that the shoes are new.",1,0,28.0
"They fit, they look good and are a good deal. I don't know that I'd train in them but for general activity/walking and lifting at the gym they feel decent.

Bought these mainly for work 12 hr shifts of constantly on feet they have support in heel under arch and in the front fit well and very comfortable for any surface,5,1,28.0
By the end of the first week I had them the soles started to fall apart. The heel support could use a little bit more of a durable material as well because standing up I noticed it felt as if I was leaning back because of the poor quality of the material over flexing. They also pick up a lot of pebbles and rocks that you can feel once trapped in the sole because of the design so I wouldn’t recommend these for outdoor activities unless you are on a smooth surface or strictly gym use... Aside of the soles these look good and the stitching is well done. Has a lot of potential they just gotta use better quality material for the soles,1,0,28.0
"The most uncomfortable shoe I have ever put on. Do not waist your money on this trash, build quality isn’t bad but the shoe for what it’s purpose is, is terrible.

"Perfect size 13 fit. These shoes have been out in the NW Montana winter for a couple weeks. I don't jog or work out but they have great traction on the snow, pavement hard ground.

These shoes are BOMB! They’re SO comfortable & true to size! I bought the red ones first and I put my dad on & he bought me the purple ones (which is my FAVORITE color)! I’m buying another pair in two more weeks (the yellow pair) and then going from there until I’m satisfied lol. I also bought my kids the red ones to match mine! You won’t be disappointed! I just hope they don’t go up on the prices because I’d much rather spend $45 opposed to $85+ & the color combos are LIT!,5,1,28.0
I felt the spring action was propelling me to do as best as I could. I'm on my feet for 8 plus hours a day and these new style shoes proved to be a benefit.

"The product fits well, however not much support, and if you walk and your heel hits anything but the memory foam, they are hard as rocks and painful. I should have ordered a size larger, as it says these run true to size, and they did not for what I typically wear.

Also , the pictures in the ad show a slightly loose, logo strap on the back of the shoe. The actual gap is way bigger than in the ad (see pics attached) making them extremely odd looking to a point I wouldn’t wear them. I cut the straps off to better the appearance.",2,0,28.0

My 11 year old wore these for one afternoon to weight lifting class at his school and they are already coming apart. Don't waste your money!

"I went with this off-brand as a result of the 10k+ good reviews, but after getting them they were too large, larger than a normal size for me.

"The shoe looks cool but it’s definitely not comfortable. When you first put them on if feels like you have something hard stuck under your heal. Then as you wear the shoe it starts to feel a little better but still uncomfortable. I wore them for about 3 weeks now and still the same everyday. When it comes to price of the shoe, in my opinion they look better than a lot of other shoes the same price but, I have definitely bought shoes from Walmart or Kroger’s that are way more comfortable.",2,0,28.0

Fit is decent but sides at ankle bone are very high and rub.",3,0,28.0
"I thought they would be comfortable from all the reviews I read. I tried them out for 5 hours during my work shift, and the first hour I was like no not going to work, no real support at all feet was aching. I stand on my feet all day at work and I had to switch shoes at the 3rd hours. My Bf used his to go workout out and he like them for that still not as comfortable as we thought but working out in a gym for a lil while they are ok, as for working these shoes are a no go. Also, order your normal shoe size.",2,0,28.0
"First shoes are true to size, I order a 13 and they fit perfectly. 2nd, not only does these shoes look good they feel good and the support is good, plus if they are good outfit shoes. Went walking 5 miles and no problem. Getting ready to buy other colors. 2👍up!!!",5,1,28.0

I was looking for some k Swiss tubes running shoes and these were the closest shoe I could find as the tubes aren’t avail any more. They are Great! They cushion the shock in walking just like the k Swiss tubes did! I am very pleased with these! They look cool and do what I wanted!,5,1,28.0
The shoe looks nice is the first thing I noticed but picking them up they are heavy. I did not expect that. Comfort wise they’re a 5 out of 10. I wouldn’t buy again. They’re stiff even after wearing several weeks. I’d never go to an all day event with these. Short term they’re fine. For the price they’re ok but not for long walks. No way.,3,0,28.0
"I loved the style. These shoes are the best looking tennis shoes I have ever seen. The price is, in my opinion, great! The fit was perfect however, the comfort wasn't what I needed. They felt quite rigid and stiff. I really wanted them to feel as good as they look, but for my old feet comfort is more important than looks.",2,0,28.0

Sole appears to be impact absorbing material but is in fact hard plastic. Not flexible and would be terrible for working out. Not a quality product. You get what you pay for.,2,0,28.0
"I love these shoes, my man loves these shoes too, we both have three pair a piece. They are very comfortable, breathable, and you can walk long walks without cramping feet. Most of all I like how I wear no socks and feet don't sweat.",5,1,28.0
"Mala calidad, se despegó parte de la suela el primer día de uso. No la devuelvo, por la complicación de tener que pagar costes antes de que me reembolsen el dinero, y por que a mi hijo le siguen gustando.

Usually wear a 10.5 but bought 11 and were way too big so probably some 10s would fit perfect. They a little heavy compare so some nikes I have.,4,1,28.0
"I purchased a size 13 men’s shoe for my husband for Christmas. He thought that the size would be too big but they actually fit well with a pair of socks. He liked the look so, I ordered him a second pair and it arrived on time. I wear a women’s size 9 but I ordered a size 7 in men’s and they fit well. I love the sole padding material inside the bottom of the shoe because my feet are narrow. I can walk in them all day without any discomfort. I will be ordering more colors!",5,1,28.0
"I think these are Nike's ripoffs BUUUT! They are GREAT quality ripoffs! 10/10! Comfy, durable and great for working out and running!",5,1,28.0

The shoes are way to tight and uncomfortable. Yes the writing looks cool but the shoes are a joke for comfort.,1,0,28.0
Purchased these for style and comfort. I wear 10/11 in women’s so I ordered a 9 men’s. Next pair will be an 8 or 8.5. Nevertheless the red color is poppin and they are quite comfy.,5,1,28.0
So far they are awesome. After a week they are holding up well. They turn heads and get lots of comments. Definitely will buy another pair or two.,5,1,28.0
These sneakers are so comfortable I brought every color in men’s and my granddaughter in woman’s true to size. It feels like you are walking on a foam mat while on concrete. I need a total knee replacement and these sneakers gave me relief on my knee with my brace on. Other sneakers did not give me the support or relief.,5,1,28.0
"I was looking for a cheap/decent new pair of shoes for running errands and going to the gym. These are not too bad for their price. They ran a little big, but not enough to where I wanted to return them. They are also a little wide, but again, nothing severe. They took a few day to get used to, but they’re pretty comfortable and I can wear them all day without any pains. Would buy again.",4,1,28.0

The shoes were great for the 1st couple times are used them to workout but the 3rd and 4th time I wore them they did not have any support and caused me to have major shin splints.,1,0,28.0
Not recommended if you are on your feet long periods. I purchased for work and being on my feet 40hrs a week they did not feel comfortable after a while. I would wear them if only wearing short period of times.,4,1,28.0
I haven’t had a chance to wear them yet but have tried them on. They fit well and are true to size. They feel very comfortable and seem like they will hold up well as I have purchased a pair before.,4,1,28.0

"Very nice and comfortable and I get tons of �?I like your shoes �?from co-workers and neighbors etc.

I wear size 9 US men’s , but I reordered size 8 1/2
And the fit perfect. The size 9 was too big for me.

I suggest 1/2 size smaller when ordering. But the refund and reorder was very fast.

I reordered the 8.5 size and took back the size 9 to kohl’s authorized return location, and that was very easy and quickly process.",5,1,28.0
"These are great shoes and very comfortable. They seem to run a little big however. I usually wear a 10.5""-11"" and that's what I ordered but feels just a little big... not too much though. I'd say fairly true to size.",5,1,28.0
I bought theses shoes 6 months ago for my daily walking. The shoes didn't last six months. The outer sole is completely worn off and my inner sole is also torn. I wouldn’t recommend for people who want to use these for workouts and running. Total waste of money.,1,0,28.0

En fin , una razón más para no comprar ropa en Amazon. Muy decepcionado.",1,0,28.0
Came very quick. This is my 2nd pair. They run big so a got 1 size smaller. Everyone at my Job loved to see them. I work on my feet all day and they feel great.,5,1,28.0
I like the padding on the inside of the shoes. They are so comfortable and gives me good support for my knees. I love the variety of colors. I had to order the men's shoes because I wear a size 12 women's and they don't carry that size and that's the only downside for me. True fit great price.,5,1,28.0
Hard plastic presses into center of ball of foot... not ergonomically designed.... cool color but not worth the pain. Get a decent pair of athletic shoes if you’re on your feet all day.,2,0,28.0
The first pair fit great. The other 3 pair the right foot is a bit tight. The left foot fits perfectly. I'm not sure but I ordered 3 more pair and each right foot is bit too short.

At the end of the first day, both my feet hurt and I was pissed. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE SHOES!!!!",1,0,28.0
"looks good when you look at it at first. I wore this for A month, and already 30% of anti slip rubbers at the bottom of shoe are gone :( NOT GOOD",1,0,28.0
Right in front of your heel the shoe is too narrow and the arch inside presses against the sides of your feet and makes them hurt,3,0,28.0
"I never leave negative reviews but I have to with these. It looks like the webbing on the bottom is springy. I can assure you it isn’t. Wooden clogs would give more bounce in your step. The shoe is built weird so it feels like your foot isn’t secure. They’re cheap, so I wasn’t expecting anything out of this world but don’t buy these to save money. I immediately went to a Nike outlet after wearing them for 5 minutes.",1,0,28.0

"Read some reviews, they looked pretty good, bought them, did not fit my feet properly, but I do have a bit of a higher arch than most people, all in all a decent shoe, but I probably would not purchase again due to they did not fit my comfort level. I’m on my feet 12 to 16 hours a day, and they did not really help with the foot pain. But try for yourself. Maybe they fit you better. But for the price range, they are absolutely phenomenal.",3,0,28.0
Thought it would be more cushion also when I walk the shoes make a sound as if I walked in water but didn’t. Very embarrassing.,3,0,28.0

"I bought these shoes after my daughter bought hers, mainly for walking around car shows and events as my feet get so hot on the pavement. I love that the shoes are breathable, but my foot is rather narrow and the shoe bunches when I tie them. I still wear them because they are comfortable and breathable.
Will most likely order them in a different color and maybe a different size to see if that makes a difference?",5,1,28.0

I get compliments all the time. These are very comfortable shoes and easy to get in and out of.,5,1,28.0
My husband loves those shoes and already wants another pair. Everybody compliments him and thinks his shoes are name brand. Very good value for this pair of shoes. The color is beautiful and they have a modern design. They also fit true to size.,5,1,28.0
I brought these because my son is very hard on his clothes and shoes. These are at a great price and the look better than some of the name brand big balling shoes that he scuffs up in days! They fit as expected! Awesome product I will be buying again,5,1,28.0
I love the look and feel. Its light weight and very comfortable. I definitely love the fact that the heal portion of the shoe doesn't have whatever kind of material (cardboard) that all shoe makers use that the one time you try to slip on the shoe without undoing shoe laces deforms the heal portion of the shoe and it makes it bothersome thereafter. Very affordable and comfortable. Definitely recommend it!,5,1,28.0

No arch support. Cheap materials. No cushioning so you feel the hard soles on the sides of your feet. I gave it an extra star becsuse they look good. They only cost $32 but still think they're not worth it. Too bad because they do look cool.,2,0,28.0

"Cheaply made. I bought the pair hoping to use them for running. Used them once and swore never to use them again.
After a mile I could feel the lumps of the sole pretty much against my foot.

The shoe is terrible with the insoles they come with. Its like walking on an asphalt street with no socks and shoes. If you have some custom insoles and if you place them in the shoe than its really comfy. The insoles i have is what makes it comfy but the shoe itself just looks cool and thats about it. If you work 12 hour shifts i would invest somewhere else.,2,0,28.0

I purchased this shoe for the sole purpose of running in them. Running was way too uncomfortable during my 2.25 mile-run. I think this shoe works best as a walking shoe and/or possibly a weight-lifting shoe. It's not a running shoe! It is very comfortable though and fits well.,3,0,28.0

"I love these shoes, they’re so light and comfortable. The price is unbeatable and they feel and look good, very similar to higher end brands that 3-4x the price. I got the white and they look amazing with everything.

The only downside is they seem to run about half a size small, even with a thin sock. I wear a 8.5 and it’s consistent in 95% of shoe brands I’ve bought. I could have definitely sized up to a 9. I’ll be getting more colors in half a size up though, definitely worth it.",4,1,28.0
"This is the second pair of these that I purchased. My son wanted a pair after he saw mine. These are a good casual shoe or for walking. Don't expect to play sports in these where you need to make quick movements...the structure of the shoe isn't built for that. The insole could be better but for the price, these are a very nice shoe.
These have lasted my son a while considering how hard he is on shoes. I would purchase them again (for me or him).",4,1,28.0
"Got these shoes for some easy hiking in parks and I pretty like it so far. I’ve had these running shoes for a week and have already pit around 8 miles in them, and they still look and feel like new. Would recommend",5,1,28.0
"I want to preface this with saying that they met my needs perfectly for what I bought them for- cheap running shoes to use on a treadmill.

Overall these shoes are a good value for the price, but I wouldn't recommend for more intensive use.
Pros:
-Super easy to wear: The elastic form means you can slip them on while still having a general form and laces to tighten them.
-Ball of the foot support: These things support the front of your foot surprisingly well. If you're doing a lot of your movement that focuses on the balls of your feet these will work well.
-Fine sole: Nothing to write home about but it does its job well and is sturdy and doesn't slip on surfaces.

Cons:
-Lack of support: As a result of the following reasons I would never use these in more intensive running as I would worry about my feet rolling or losing my grip.
-Heel slippage: Due to the elastic nature of the shoe my heels are always sliding around, moreso toward the middle. I imagine this could be fixed by a third party insole but at that point you might as well spend your money on a better shoe.
-Inner arch support: Same thing as above, it doesn't provide much support and as someone with flat feet I could feel my feet wanting to roll.
-Lack of shock absorption: The insoles provided and the soles don't do much for real running/jogging environments. They feel fine on a treadmill but jogging in a park or hiking I could feel my feet getting sore minutes in.

Overall they're fine for the price point and if you need a casual stopgap pair of shoes, but do not buy these as your primary pair of shoes. Even if you're just doing lots of walking I could see them causing issues down the line.",3,0,28.0
"On time, comfortable, correct size and acceptably priced. Quality to be determined but appears to be good. Would buy again. Insoles were better than expected. However I would not work 8 or more hours a day in them without first getting aftermarket insoles. Perfect for casual use or maybe some light walks, jogs, etc.

UPDATE: have been wearing these daily now for more than a month. Quality still Seems great! However the vinyl “branding label�?in the heel, on the insole was squeaking against my socks, if the humidity inside the shoes increased. However the label seems to be wearing off and the squeaking is going away.
I can see how that squeaking could be a problem for people.",5,1,28.0
I normally wear 10.5. I got 10.5. Shoes were too tight in the toe (width area) for comfort. The worse thing to me was how short and loose the heel area was. They were sliding up and down the back of heel. Trash. It's a real shame because I like the way these shoes look. They are very light-weight and the soles felt like they had a lot of cushiony support. I actually tend not to like that because it throws my balance off. Feels kinda like I'm wearing high-heel shoes...I image. I've never worn high-heels :),1,0,28.0
"So I ordered these along with an olive green hat and some camo cargo shorts for one of the outfits to wear out on a weekend.

The shoes feel REALLY comfortable and I happen to not feel any foot pain at all throughout my day. The color was actually close to just about everything else I wore and the laces stayed fairly tight through the day as well.

The only downside I had was that there was too much toe room. I wear an 11.5 in Nike and Adidas. All other shoes I either have to size up or size down. This is one of the ones I’ll need to size down by a 1/2 size.

Other than that, I would recommend these shoes as there aren’t much of an advertisement and there are PLENTY of colors to go with outfits.",5,1,28.0
"Do not recommend buying. The shoes Barry come in any packaging, just in a bag. The quality isn’t great even if it isn’t expensive they should still be able to get a cleaned up finished product. Mine came with plenty of glue dried up on the shoe and even after cleanup there is still a lot left",1,0,28.0
"These are nice shoes for the price. But I bought them for daily walks of 3+ miles. Unfortunately, they aren’t comfortable nor supportive enough, and I returned them. I’ll stick with my preferred brand, ASICS. IMO, the higher price for the name brand walking/running shoes is worth it for better support.",3,0,28.0
"I'd really like to return these because they are too narrow for my feet. My return window already closed, since when is there only a 30 day return window!?
-customer service allowed a chat to do a return.
They're good and cheap enough for what I need them for (school clinicals). They are a NARROW fit kind of like Nikes so if you have a wider foot like myself these aren't going to be the best fit for you, but I love how they just slip on, prob the best feature of the shoe.",3,0,28.0
"Nice looking shoe. I would definitely not use for running, but it is just fine for walking and I use them for golfing. Very comfortable and provide sufficient grip - about same as spikeless golf shoes. Maybe not for wet weather golf.

Cannot comment on durability at this point.",5,1,28.0
"I liked the design colors, and the overall comfort, but they will be tight across the instep for anyone with a high arch. And they seem to run a little small - unless you wear them without sox.
However, they can be broken in by using shoe-trees.",5,1,28.0
"These are just perfect! Got the loop on the back to slide these on! I can run, walk, they are easy to clean and the memory foam is good. I am single mom that don’t splurge in myself but I totally feel like I did here. Great alternative to more expensive shoes!",4,1,28.0

I will be buying more pairs in more colors!",5,1,28.0
Bought these for my husband. He wore them on our Disneyworld trip 10+ hours and they were comfortable,5,1,28.0
True to size I bought these to find an alternative to my hey dude shoes and honestly I like these a lot better. These have rubber on the bottom of the foam so they will last a lot longer than comparable brands that are only foam bottom.,5,1,28.0
"These are extremely comfortable shoes. I'm very happy. They are also lightweight.

"First off, these shoes are insanely comfortable, and fit perfectly. However, the ""bubble"" traction pattern on the bottom of the shoe makes a loud snap / pop when you walk, at literally the volume of popping bubble packaging.

"I’m not a marathon runner and in fact I’m far from it, run about 2 miles 4-5 days a week and was looking to replace my current new balances but wanted to try something new because all I buy are NB’s. These shoes, to me, were stunning. Minute I put them on, felt comfortable, light, but the sole is deceivingly thick. But not so much that it feels like your trucking around in some basketball shoes. These also on an aesthetic level...god do they pop. I knew they were fresh as hell the moment I put them on but I got 5 compliments the first day I wore these around just to break them in. Probably going to get another pair just for walking around. I’m not some expert runner so there may be flaws to my untrained eye but I am beyond impressed with these. I go around to different brands with different athletic gear and I always wind up in one way or another going back to Nike. They’ve always had superb products and they are still at the top of their game with these shoes.",5,1,28.0

"Coming from nike air pegasus and air vomeros...which were nice, this one does not have any Nike air unit. But for casual walking the dog etc, these are perfect at 1/3 the price of the high end premium nikes.

Can't wait to see what the Revolution 6 will look like.",5,1,28.0
"I've worn the Revolution 3,4, and 5 and, to be honest, the Revolution 3 has maintained its position as the most comfortable and best fitting of the bunch.

"I feel like I should write a formal apology to the reviewers that said this shoe is too narrow. I read it and thought ""Well I'm sure it's a bit more narrow than expected, but there's no way it's THAT bad right?"" Oh...poor naive 2020 me. Ironically as hindsight is 2020, I could not forsee how incorrect I was. The shoes arrive and I'm excited. New shoes, new me. As soon as I slid my foot in, the edge of the insole right where the arch of my foot is was jabbing into it. ""Surely it's not that bad. It's probably just the padding that needs to be shifted around"" and to my surprise, it doesn't budge. I'm throwing these on before I head to work and so I wore these devil contraptions for the day. The soles of the shoes feel much flatter than the revolution 4. I wear a wide size, but it feels like they made the fabric a bit wider, while forgetting to make the sole wider at all. This is just significantly worse than the Revolution 4. It's not as comfortable by any means. Save your money. Go buy moon shoes or something. At least those are pretty rad and will put a smile on your face.",2,0,28.0

"I'm not sure why I care how my feet look as I jog past total strangers, but these Revolution 5 running shoes make me feel like I pop off the page when I pound pavement. They look so good -- so streamlined and uncluttered, with the iconic Nike swoosh, a color scheme that channels the original Air Jordan shoe, and a projection of class and timelessness in an era of obnoxiously loud shoe designs.

What I didn't expect at this low price point is a light, breathable, elite-performing running shoe: They offer the ample cushion I now need after a period of conspicuous consumption, and feel spring-loaded as they push back against the road or sidewalk. Fit is true to U.S. sizing with no sore feet in the break-in period.

An elite running shoe in every way, and the fact they're half the price of what I'm used to spending is a massive bonus. - (Was this review of use? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!)",5,1,28.0
"This is the second pair that I've had a problem with. The first pair I bought for my husband for Christmas. Within a couple of weeks one of the shoes started making a popping sound when he walks, like an air bubble was in the sole. We were beyond the return time, so I just bought a second. The second pair did the exact same thing. They lasted a little bit longer, but still too late to return them.",1,0,28.0
"After buying and returning a handful of different sneakers from Nike and New Balance, I have finally found a sneaker that is comfortable and fits my wide feet. The toe box is very large, wonderful for me especially because I have a bunion on my right foot and the extra room gives an enormous relief from the pressure. I have not found this type of width in other ""wide"" shoes and I am always on the lookout for wide shoes. I love them, thanks Nike!",5,1,28.0
"The popping/squeaking/clicking sound is from the cheap glue on the bottom of the thin insole. It’s still a comfortable shoe without the insole, but I just added some baby powder between the insole and inside bottom of the shoe and it got rid of the annoying popping sound.",1,0,28.0
"This feels like a piece of plastic, gives about the same amount of comfort as a piece of plastic. Nike should stop worrying about driving the cost down and the profits up. Nike needs to get back to making comfortable shoes that have value and comfort for the money, instead of worrying about 3D printers to make the cost of shoes even cheaper than the cheap labor they already have. This is the last pair(s) of Nike I am buying until I see a return to quality! Many of my friends feel the same way too.",2,0,28.0
"I bought these for my husband and he told me they’re very comfortable and good for standing in. He’s a cashier and stands in one place awhile.

I’m glad that they make wide sizes, that’s one of the reasons we bought these!",5,1,28.0
These have to be some of the comfiest shoes I have gotten at this price point but now comes the bad. Since the first time I took them to the gym for a run I heard a squeakiness come from them - At first I thought it was just me but it continues to happen. I wondered if it was just my sweat rubbing inside the shoe but later on found out that the rubber on the bottom was what was squeaking which happens all the time during normal use and during workouts. I used them roughly a few months before getting tired of it where the squeak drives you crazy. I’ve heard this is hit and miss with this shoe but since ive had it for a while I’m just going to find new shoes. If you get a squeaky pair have them swapped ASAP as it will NOT go away.,3,0,28.0
"I have bought two pairs of these shoes, months apart, and the left shoe bottom for each pair squeaks all the time. Squeaks on any surface, grass, dirt, pavement, carpet.

Nike has been my favorite shoe company for over 30 years, so disappointing.",1,0,28.0
"shoes look great regarding red on white. worried about quality in long term though. the glue and sewing / seams look cheap, discoloration on heel. i've attached a couple of photos and highlighted the issues. shoes are wide enough for me in this size so I don't have to buy wide-specific. huge problem - shoes rub against my inside ankles enough to irritate me when i first put them on. once i get running, sensation goes away. shipment arrived in poor quality - rubber bands and dented, torn box. will update review in January 2022 and revisit rating.",2,0,28.0
"I have always had a hard time finding shoes that are supportive for working out. I also, have wide feet and men’s shoes seem to fit me better than women’s sizes. When I was younger I injured my tailbone and hip and I have a harder time with not being in back pain when I walk long distances. I liked the look and feel of these shoes because they had a knit cloth, not the leather that pinches my feet together around my toes. When I received them, I took them on a trial and walked in the for awhile. These shoes do have some support, however, they have memory foam in them which was not supportive enough for my knees or my back.",4,1,28.0
"I have always been a fan of the Nike Revolution series, they were my favorite running/gym shoe. Hence, my frustration with the revolution 5.

I was severely disappointed in the pair I received. The build quality and fit and finish was absolutely terrible. There was exposed foam padding, excess, nasty, yellow/green dried adhesive all around the sole, and the back of the shoe was sewn and constructed so poorly and crookedly, it looked like it had been broken in already despite being new. To top it all off, the shoe wasn’t even clean, there was debris stuck to the sole like it had already been worn in public. These aren’t the most expensive shoes, but I expected a much better quality from something with a Nike logo.",1,0,28.0
The shoes arrived exactly as promised without any damage to the product. When they arrived I immediately tried them on. I was thoroughly amazed at how comfortable and lightweight the shoes were. I've had them on for more than 2 hours now and the fit and feel couldn't be better. I order my regular shoe size and they fit great. I highly recommend these to all my friends.,5,1,28.0

"I have been a lifelong Nike customer - especially for shoes. I purchased these off of amazon as a replacement to a well loved pair of old nike running shoes. I liked them because they had a lot of options in wide sizes and I really liked the black/anthracite color combo.
I wore these probably 4-5 days a week doing 4 mile walks on paved roads, and for the first 3 months of ownership they were wonderful. Fit perfect, comfortable, stylish - all that I've come to expect from Nike. However, after about the 3rd month of wearing these both shoes developed holes right at the achilles tendon and there were these razor sharp plastic pieces poking through the shoes (see pictures, hard to see, but there is a white plastic part poking through the back). This pretty quickly made these shoes unwearable as the plastic was digging into my skin. I figured something has to be defective here, why would BOTH shoes develop these holes in the exact same spot from what I would consider light use for running shoes. Unfortunately, 3 months is just outside the amazon limit for returns so I turned to Nike expecting them to remedy this for me, I filled a claim through their customer support system and paid to send them the shoes back. about a week and a half later Nike told me that this was ""wear and tear"" and that they would not return / refund / exchange the shoes - I escalated the issue and asked for another review, which was AGAIN rejected and I was told it's wear and tear. So ultimately, I ended up out 80 bucks for the shoes, 10 bucks to ship them to nike for essentially 3 months of light use. This is NOT how I would expect a brand I've been loyal to for years to handle it's customers or it's products. Needless to say, after nike returned my shoes to me, I promptly threw them (and my 90 dollars) in the trash and order some Under Armour Infinite running 2's. Sadly, this is likely my last nike product, I can't purchase products from a company not willing to stand behind its brand. I'd highly recommend avoiding this shoe, unless u like sharp plastic :).",1,0,28.0
I can’t believe they try to pull this off as ‘wide fit�? The arch support area is one of the most narrow running shoe I’ve ever put on to the point where I laughed when I put all the weight on my foot. I’m only 6ft 190 lbs I don’t even have that wide of a foot. These are for someone who’s 5�?�?150lbs. Such a waste of time ordering these and having to return them now. I should have just taken a trip to the shoe store.,2,0,28.0
"I love these shoes. I normally do not purchase shoes online but I found this pair with this seller and I love Nike shoes which I usually purchase through the Nike Employee Store in Beaverton Oregon, but because of the COVID-19 that store has been closed for a month and I have limited access when that store is open. I found these pair on line and the price was actually really good. The shoes fit perfectly and they are super light and great for running. What a difference. I completely recommend these shoes. If you are looking for a really light fully supportive running shoe look no further. Way to go Nike.",5,1,28.0

"First some context... I have a knee injury, when I purchase shoes they normally last me 3 to 4 years. This Nike shoes I purchased in May of 2020, they started to fall apart before Jan 2021. I live in Texas and like I said a knee injury that prevents me from doing a lot. The shoes bottoms do not wear out in my shoes as I don't drag my feet since it would cause me a lot more pain. The shoe soles is what wears out and causes me to replace my shoes

Problem - The shoe bottoms started detaching them selves from the rest of the shoe around Nov 2020. I used gel super glue because it was just a tiny corner that came up ...at first. since the bottoms are put on like a puzzle set some of the corners face the front of the shoe causing me to stumble when walking. Its now May 2021 and they have become on usable almost and I'm looking to buy some different shoes now.

I bought this pair to use strictly for walking/running and the this particular fit is just too narrow. About 20 minutes in, my arches and heel start to throb.

My son and I own a pair. Within weeks one pair of shoes started to click and the tread started coming off both of them within 1 month. I was out of my return window so I called Nike to open a claim.

So I really liked these shoes. Super light and comfortable. I got the white with the light blue check. The material is super soft. I would recommend to get a darker color. My German Shepard put her paw on the front and it was EXCEPTIONALLY hard to get it off. The material really absorbs the littlest bit of dirt. They feel and look good.

After only a few months, the outsole began to separate at the toe and wear out along the inside edge. While I wear them everyday, I am gentle with my things and have not done any strenuous activity with them, even though they are marketed as athletic shoes.",3,0,28.0
"Had 2 pair of Nikes previously so I was confident that the fit would be good, and it is. Very comfortable. The wider width works with my feet! Good value.",4,1,28.0

I feel like these are fake. These are the squeakiest shoes I've ever owned. And not like the bottom. They are squeaky on carpet. It's like when I bend on the ball of my toes squeak squeak squeak. Everyone knows I'm coming. Lol.,1,0,28.0
"These are very comfortable and great for my workouts. However, after about 3 weeks, the left shoe started to make a crack noise on every step as if a rock was stuck in the bottom. The noise is coming from inside the shoe. Then, after a month, the right shoe started doing the same thing. They are now so annoyingly loud that I can't wear them. From a performance standpoint, they are great. Craziest thing how both seem to have broken somehow and make this noise.",2,0,28.0

"My grandson won't wear anything else. Very comfortable and nice looking. However, since it's a fabric shoe, it doesn't last forever especially on a 12 year old's foot everyday. That's not really a drawback since kid's feet grow so fast.",5,1,28.0
"Got it in black, this shoe looks and feels great for the price. There is a good amount of bounce and support to the shoes. My only concern is durability. I will update the review if they last less than a year. Hopefully there will be no updates.

"I jog 3 miles on asphalt most days, landing on mid foot or toes, weigh 140lbs. What I like about shoe is the super comfortable uppers without seams...plenty wide to accommodate toes. These are not cushy shoes, which is fine for the type of jogging I do, but would not work perhaps for heavier or heel landing runners. They took about 30-40 miles to break in...the ankle collar at first was digging into my left ankle bone, but that has completely resolved now.",4,1,28.0
"Very comfortable, decent ankle support for working out. Great for running errands as well. High quality material and comfortable sole",5,1,28.0

They took off the strap on the back of the shoe which is so helpful in putting the shoe on. Now it is difficult to get the foot in. But once inside it still is so very comfy.,3,0,28.0
These shoes are light weight and comfortable. I really was enjoying them until the right shoe developed some type of click or pop in the sole as you walk. I only wear them to work M-F 8-5.

"The shoes would be great, if they didn't make a click or pop sound in them after EVERY STEP. In hindsight, there are many online complaints in this same defect, yet I missed them before buying.

I love these shoes except for one small problem. They are not slip resistant at all. The slightest lack of friction can have you fumbling. It's more for walking at a moderate pace or home use. This shoe would be perfect if there was more grip at the bottom. Other similar Nike shoe's had it so why not these?,4,1,28.0

"These shoes fit my feet well, provided good support, and were very light.

Everyday wear. Something broken inside one sole on day one. A week later the other one broke. There is a popping sound with every step. It sounds like I’ve stepped in gum and the shoes are sticking to a sidewalk.,3,0,28.0
We have only had these sneakers for 1 week and the black sole that curves up to the top of the shoe has already peeled back. I tried to glue it back on but now the top of shoe has a glue stain. Very disappointed with the poor workmanship for this brand and price.,1,0,28.0

So I won't lie I'm a big girl and I weigh roughly 350 lbs and I am on my feet all day at work and I got these because everyday my back is killing me and after wearing these while working it is the first time that I wasn't hobbling out to my car after my shift,5,1,5.0

I can do 6 miles and my feet are good and better yet they hold my ankle well. I didn’t realize how my feet were twisting/moving too much in my Adidas shoes that were way too wide. I have better support and they look like high end sneakers. My brother spends $100 and up on sneakers and he was impressed. -Heather",5,1,5.0

"So I ordered the purple ones and I got pink, but honestly I’ve decided I like the pink ones better anyways and also these are the most comfortable running shoes I’ve had in YEARS! The minute I put them on it was like walking on a cloud. I can’t wait to wear these in the gym! I just took my dogs for a walk in them and usually my back hurts a lot when I walk both dogs (I have two) but these shoes made it much less painful for me and my back issues. If you’re looking for new gym shoes or just walking in general, get a pair of these!!",5,1,5.0
Great shoe. I needed a good running shoe & these r comfortable & I live the black & white. Look cute,5,1,5.0
"After reading the reviews . I thought I’d give this shoe s a try . I normally wear Nike .I’ve only had them for a few days I wanted to make sure they were going to work I’m not sure if I’m keeping them or not I like the way they look, but after having them on for a few hours my left foot hurts .It could be just me . I have experience this with any other shoe .I don’t think I could wear these gym shoes more then a few hours",5,1,5.0
"Comfortable and affordable. Fits great and has nice air flow.

Very comfortable for any type of workout. I like how my feet look in them- very sleek.,5,1,5.0
"I purchased these for walking/jogging but didn't realize they were not Air Max even though they looked awfully close. The comfort is not good & the shoes left a bruise on my skin underneath the tongues just from walking. They fit snug even though I ordered a larger size than I wear. Needless to say, I was disappointed but not going to waste time trying to return them. These are pretty much Bo Bo's.",1,0,5.0
"Overall, gorgeous color and great quality. Can hardly tell the difference in comfort between these and Under Armour or Nike - right out of the box. I think this shoe runs a little small however so if you have a wider feet, the narrow toe probably won't work for you. I was really impressed with the comfort level and arch support for this price. There were two main reasons why I returned these. 1) narrow toe bed rubbed too much 2) puffy heal piece felt like it may get uncomfortable. I have a shoe now with a very thin heal support and I'm not used to a thicker one.",3,0,5.0
"These shoes look just like the photos. They came nicely packaged. They are very lightweight. The only thing I don’t care for about them is that they are very pointy and narrow through the toe area. If you have any toe problems or like a little room for your toes to be able to move, these are not the shoes for you. I wore them to work and couldn’t wait to take them off when I got home. I haven’t worn them since. And in my opinion because they are so narrow and pointy the made my feet look a lot bigger 🙁",3,0,5.0
"I searched Nike Air and this was included in the products that were listed. As it stated ""Air"" I did not fully see that it was not a Nike product. When I received the shoes they were a bit on the large side but being that they were running shoes, I thought I just needed the extra room for my toes. Unfortunately, I tried running the treadmill in these three times. Each time, the ball on my right foot would ache after wearing them. Furthermore Nike was no where listed on the shoe. I went back to my Amazon order and sure enough they were not made by Nike. Sure they are eye catching. They're pretty and as long as you're really not trying to exercise in them, they're probably alright. I noticed that after working out with them three times the rubber off the bottom started to wear and come off. These are really cheap tennis shoes. They hurt my feet and I've returned them in hopes of a refund. I feel misled.",1,0,5.0
"I really wanted to love these. They are super cute, but that's all they got going for them. I was excited based on other reviews. I tried these out going shopping.
My feet hurt more than they have in a long time and i have plantar fasciitis. I have bad ankles and they ached. My low back pain (degenerative disc disorder, arthritis and scoliosis) is already enough, these shoes were TERRIBLE!. i bought some new inserts and instantly they were better. There's no cushion. No give, i think a pizza box has more cushion. I included pics of the shoe insoles. If I'm going to pay extra just to make them tolerable is not worth it.

On another note the tongue seems extra long and is a bit annoying.",1,0,5.0
Love these shoes!!! So cushiony and comfortable and they look cute. Don’t hurt my feet. Highly recommend.,5,1,5.0
When I ordered them I ordered a size 9. They sent me a 9.5. The 9.5 barely fit. They do not run true to their size. They are a small shoe. Plus when tying the shoe you have to hold the tongue of the shoe in place other wise it does not stay in place. They are a pretty shoe and some what comfortable but I wouldn't get then again. To much of a hassle,3,0,5.0
"I have had these shoes two months and found out today they have multiple cracks along the bottom. Shortly after I got them, I had to walk in the rain and noticed my feet got soaked. I wrote it off as a heavy rain, so didn't check the bottoms of the shoes. It's been fairly dry lately, so I didn't question the two times my feet got soaked until today when I was walking in a sprinkling rain and my feet again got soaked, so I checked the bottoms of the shoes and sure enough, they have multiple horizontal cracks in the bottoms.
They are beautiful shoes. I got compliments several times a week on how good they look. They were very comfortable (as long as the weather was dry). They dry out quickly when they get wet, but unfortunately my socks do not. Good looks doesn't do it for me, it's merely a small reason for the shoes I buy. I'm practical in my shoe purchases and have different expectations for different shoes. I expect my work shoes to only last six months because my job is insane and the work is hard on them. I expect my sneakers to last at least one year, usually they last at least two years because they are only worn to and from work and on errands. So these sneakers were a major disappointment. Two months is a waste of my money.",1,0,5.0
They have decent grip and are supportive and comfortable over all. But the toes are pretty narrow. I would recommend going at least a half a size up. If you have wide feet I might go a full size up.,3,0,5.0
Beautiful shoes. So comfortable. Unfortunately my daughter has only had them for 3 months. She is on her feet most of the day for her job. What a shame that these are just about completely broken in half!! I am really disappointed!!,1,0,5.0
"I am an In-home Caregiver. These shoes are the only shoes I have found that keep up with me. That is above Sketchers, Ryka and Reebok. I have all three.
My feet don't ache, they don't sweat and these shoes are quiet. I'll keep buying these. I also bought a pair for my daughter and will buy a pair for my husband. He works in a nursing home. Good shoes are so important. I'm very pleased with these! The price is even better! No more $100 shoes that don't help!",5,1,5.0
"I have ordered a lot of gym shoes, as I teach fitness classes, and I am always looking for a good shoe. I will not spend a lot of money due to the frequency of needing new ones so often. I have been pleased with this shoe! I must say I purchased for the look, which I like and for the price, not expecting the shoe to be as supportive as it was. Probably the best I’ve had in a long time! I waited to do the review to see if it was a “honeymoon�?fit, but so far (a month in) they still feel good on my feet. I have not even added heel strikes to them, as I often do.",5,1,5.0
"I am having a problem with numb toes and slight pain behind the toes which doesn't bother me too much, but I think I also broke a bone in my foot which is sore enough to keep me from covering the whole grocery store when shopping. None of my Nikes or sandals are comfortable. The only shoes that were less painful were my Croc Freesails which they don't make anymore and my Teva sandal clodhoppers.

When I saw these I decided to try a pair. I must have had a screw loose that day because I bought the white shoes which will get dirty fast! However, the color doesn't matter because these shoes seem to be fixing my feet. I can wear them all day and when I take them off at night my feet feel better than they did in the morning.

Now these shoes have substantial fabric and substantial weight. I weighed ONE of my new Gannou size 9.5's and it weighed 12.75 ounces. My Nike Air Pegasus weighs 9.25 ounces. So, not light--more like hiking boots.

The only thing I don't like is that the tongue is very long and sticks up if I don't use the top shoelace hole which is very high and just too much for me to use. That is very minor and I don't care because these shoes have so many pluses.

These shoes have a nice wide and long toe box which is perfect for me. My actual size is 9.5 and these fit beautifully with a nice thick sole.

I am so happy with them I bought a darker pair. I just hope the sizing is consistent.",5,1,5.0
"About me:

�?Normally wears a size 11 in my favorite brand of running shoes (Nike Winflow 6) which leaves me with a small thumb-size of wiggle room, so I purchased these in an 11 and they are the same size (actually the Nike’s seem a 1/4 inch or so longer). Amazon recommended that I buy them in a 10 because I wear a size 10 in NON-running shoes, so be careful with that.

�?I overpronate when I run

�?I run about 1-2 miles, 2-3 times per week and walk an additional 2-4 miles throughout the week for exercise

�?I’ve been running for years and have tried several brands of shoes

About the shoes following my first run:

�?Fit- as expected
�?Comfort rating- 5/5 (straight out of the bag & during the 1st run)
�?Visual appeal- as expected
�?Over-pronation Support- 4/5

Cons: the lip seems a bit long and the shoes do feel a little less sturdy than what I’m used to, but this didn’t affect my run at all. I do not expect these shoes to last as long as my usual shoes do (I anticipate that they’ll need to be replaced after about 4 months).

Overall, these are a steal for their price, as my preferred shoe can cost $80+ Per pair. I’ve already ordered a second pair.",5,1,5.0
I work as an ER nurse and I need new shoes every year since I work three 12 hour shifts every week (sometimes more). I've bought shoes from amazon before and was disappointed but during the COVID times I decided to try again and I was very impressed with how these shoes felt and looked!! I haven't worn them at work because I'll need to throw away my shoes once COVID gets cleared but I've worn them around and I love them so far!,5,1,5.0

I work primarily on my feet, roughly 60 hr work weeks between primary job and home life of having four dogs.
Yes, I considered the price difference could reflect quality. I did NOT expect these shoes to start failing me after a month.

If you need these for occasional walking or day trips- they are great. No break in period needed.

But if you want them to stand up to regular wear and tear from daily, all day use? Pay the higher price. You get what you pay for sometimes.",2,0,5.0
I actually accidentally got these shoes thinking they were Nikes :-D needless to say Nike is Nike for a reason. These shoes are very flimsy.,1,0,5.0
"If you are looking for shoes that can handle physical activities that are more than a leisurely walk, DO NOT buy these! I made it 15 minutes into a HIIT workout before I had to take them off and finish the rest with just socks on; having no support genuinely was better than the pain these caused in that short of time. These are totally for fashion, not at all for function.",1,0,5.0
I will never pay over a hundred dollars for sneakers ever again. 😘 I'm in love ❤️,5,1,5.0
"These feel great. They appear to be Nike rip-offs, but what I care about most is the comfort and I can get away with wearing them at work. I can't find Nikes like this anyway with the air pocket bubble under the heel. I wish the tongue label wasn't there or I would have given 5 stars. The tongue label makes them look cheap. They are cheap though. In any case, they're comfortable.",4,1,5.0
The shoe is stiff & a bit inflexible to put on with regards to the ankle area. After walking in them for more than an hour my heels are sore. Definitely not good for wearing for long periods of time or high impact running/sports/work outs. Would not purchase this brand again in the future.,3,0,5.0
"Bought these thinking they were a specific brand and was happy to find out they are a nice fit sneaker. The air pockets in the back give more support to the ankle in my opinion and the mesh like material around the rest of the sneaker fits snuggly to your foot. However, I feel that the quality is a bit off outside of shoe towards the edging feels a bit cheaply made.

"I bought these shoes finally after two times wearing, I decide to wear these to a football game at the sofi stadium, sure did I wear Socks with them , yeah, did I buy them in my exact size yes, did my heal occasionally flip out sure, just tie them tighter.
After the game we pulled over at a restaurant mid 6pm at night while families were walking up for their Sunday dinner, as I was Walking up my heal flew out of the left shoe and as I tried to catch myself my right shoe decide to give out, both feet flew out of my shoes I landed Face first into the cement busting my lip which I just Had done.

"Was trying to get shoes for work that were not too expensive because I work around a bunch of veterinary type cleaning chemicals and that usually kills shoes. These so far have lasted a few months no holes yet, and are comfortable. My last relatively cheap pair I bought lasted two weeks so much better. We recently got in some snow and these don't have a lot of warmth or barrier from the cold so wear extra socks then. Fit is normal.",5,1,5.0
I'd recommend ordering a half size down. I wear a 9 and ordered a 9. They're too long. Look like boats!! They're comfy on my heel area.,4,1,5.0
"Not bad at all! My daughter bought them for me for Christmas. I was so happy they're actually rubber at the bottom and not foam! They fit true to size and are comfortable. You could add insoles for extra comfort but that's for any shoe. Also they give good stable height without the bulk. For shorter people like myself it was a plus.
UPDATE:
AFTER ONE MONTH! SHOE LACES LOOP HOLES CRACKED ON BOTH SHOES! Around the holes where the shoe laces go through it's made of plastic. I was tying my shoes and noticed they had cracked down at the lowest loop holes. Greatly disappointed but I'm still wearing them didn't want to hurt my daughter's feelings.",4,1,5.0
"These shoes came at least two sizes too large. I had to return them, but didn’t like them enough to repurchase smaller size. I also didn’t want to guess what size I should order so it’ll fit me. Even if I did have giant feet, the shoes are way too soft and flimsy. Maybe good if you want to wear them to take a short walk to the supermarket, but cannot recommend them for anything else. They basically have zero support.",2,0,5.0
I really like these Sneakers and you can't beat the Price. I have had them a month now and Wear them to do Cardio Daily. (Elliptical) They are Comfortable and allow enough Toe Space for my wide feet. I did put Thin Dr. Scholl Gel Inserts in them for a little extra Cushion. If you are looking for Arch Support these are not the Sneaker for you but they are very Comfortable to me. And I have gotten compliments on the Style.,5,1,5.0
"I never have any luck when ordering shoes or clothes online, but took a chance when I saw these shoes, looove the color so vibrate purple.
So comfortable (little snug in the beginning but will loosen when being worn) they are true to size i am a 9 1/2 and they fit perfect. I’m going to order the peach and black once as well. First day of wearing them I got compliments, and my friend loved them as much as me and ordered herself the same shoes that night.",5,1,5.0
"Overall, I like the look of the shoe. While it is comfortable and lightweight, I don’t care for the material on the inside of the shoe. It’s slick and my foot is constantly sliding around every step I take, especially on a downward incline - it slides forward on each step. I took a 2.5 mile walk today and did some other minimal walking throughout the day and my feet HURT. I don’t remember them feeling this way in my other shoes (Nikes). I ordered the same size I normally get in other brands.",3,0,5.0
I was fooled by the product description and ratings. I bought these to wear to my job as a restaurant manager and I almost fell down every few minutes. The soles are made of a very hard plastic so they also become really uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. I had to leave work to go change shoes because I could not have made it through the day in these death traps.,1,0,5.0
"Hands down THE BEST purchase I've made on Amazon. This shoe is everything it was described as. It is sized perfectly! I haven't had the best results with clothing or shoes turning out as described or what you see in the picture on Amazon, but, THIS WAS PERFECT. I highly recommend purchasing these shoes. I will buy more again in the future. I wish all Amazon purchases could be this perfect.",5,1,5.0
"Won't know how good they are until a few weeks, but from the try on point of view, perfect fit & comfortable....I usually only wear ASICS but they are becoming not comfortable....these are 100% better from a first impression stand point....time will tell on the supportive side. Plus they're true to size. I purchased 7.5",5,1,5.0
"Adorable, BUT poor quality. I bought them for my 11 year old daughter and she wore them to school every day However, as cute as they are, her entire right sole started peeling up and and completely Ripped off within 6 weeks.

They are simply not well made, and I’ve seen this in other posts as well.",2,0,5.0
Okay so does she looks nice it feels like if it was the right size it will be comfortable however I asked for a size 10 I don't know what I got I'm guessing is a size 9 however one of my feet are tighter than the other foot they squeeze too tight it supposed to be wide as well they're too small this is not a 10 I do know my shoe size,5,1,5.0
"Being a fitness instructor, I thought I would purchase a pair of these shoes because they looked like they had good support inside and out and would be comfortable to jump around in. Sadly, they are not. The insoles have no cushion to them, I felt like I was working out without shoes on. My feet were in a lot of pain. So, I’m just going to use them for everyday use. I got what a paid for, but looks like I’ll have to spend a little more for comfort : / Oh well, lesson learned.",1,0,5.0
"Had these shoes a few weeks now, because I needed something better for standing all day at work. Definitely recommend. Gotten lots of compliments too. I usually wear a 9.5 wide and sized up to a 10 and it's perfect. Only problem is the white accent above heal is starting to crack on both sides.",4,1,5.0
I love love love These! Every athletic type shoe I've got on Amazon- I've loved. These have some weight to them but not a lot. They have a mesh front and it's easy to move in. The colors are cute. I will buy other colors in the future. Also- when delivered they come In a clear sack. Not a box so one shoe was bent for a good minute where the ankle is.,5,1,5.0
I returned the order and asked for a refund! I received a second pair of shoes instead of my request for a refund! The left shoe caused pain to my ankle. The product was stiff and not bendable as described in the add. I am returning the second pair of shoes and hope to receive my refund.,1,0,5.0
Comfortable sneaker however the second day I wore them the bottom rubber by the heal on both sneakers started to loosen. Unfortunately i had to use some supper glue to glue back the heals and it’s noticeable. I would have preferred to not have to even had to do it. Other than that they are comfortable. Just be prepared to glue them,2,0,5.0
These are an okay shoe. I've already rolled my ankle twice on the first day. They're heavy and not very flexible. Feels like I can get the stretchy fabric tight enough without it pressing into the top of my foot.,1,0,5.0
"These sneakers are so pretty! Literally every time I wore them I would get compliments on them. However, after about six weeks the foam totally wore out and it felt like I was wearing thin flip flops on concrete everywhere I walked. So, all in all, it wasn’t a worthwhile purchase. I can’t even wear them anymore.",5,1,5.0
"Although the shoes looked really cute, they were very very uncomfortable on my feet. I gave them away and I’m not sure if anyone ever wore them.",2,0,5.0
Didn't notice they werent real Nike till the delivery notification. I am on my feet running around at work for 8 hours and wanted to cry after wearing them. Mind you I broke them in before that! Not enough cushion if you're constantly on your feet,1,0,5.0
Thought these were NIKE sneakers and are not. They are uncomfortable and painful to walk in. They are very stiff sneakers and working out is impossible. Very disappointed- guess I should have read all of the fine print but the way they’re pictured makes you believe they’re Nike air .,1,0,5.0
"I am a nurse so I am on my feet for 12+ hours. I went off the reviews and decided to give these shoes a try! I do not like these shoes at all!

I wish I would have kept my $40 and put it toward a pair of brooks, asics or nikes !!!!",3,0,5.0
I am so surprised how much comfort these offer. They cost only a fraction of name brand shoes and offer. They are cute too. I purchased a few different colors and I am glad that I have. Don't sleep on the comfort that these have to offer. I am not disappointed about purchasing these lamps,4,1,5.0
"I love the shoes, they are really comfortable however, I they gave me the wrong size. I had orginally ordered an 8 which didn't fit (inside said 7.5-8.

Now I have two pairs of the same size that I can't wear. I don't know what I am going to do about returning them because I don't want to leave the house due to the CA lockdown but that was a lot of money wasted....",3,0,5.0
Not gonna lie have actually worn these out as yet because I want to keep these in good condition. Love my little knockoffs w their support and appeal. I just hope the stand the test of time (looks like it though).,5,1,5.0
So for me it doesn't fit I have wide feet and I seen other reviews that said they have wide feet and it fit but for me it didn't maybe if I went a half a size up but my shoe size is a 6 and a half to 7 so I got a 7 but it's just not wide enough for my feet so if you have wide feet they may not be for you,2,0,5.0

These shoes were purchased for a quick trip to NYC where we planned to do a lot of walking.

I’m going to buy more colors so I can hit the street in style AND comfort!",5,1,5.0
"Amazon wins again!!! So much comfort and versatile and super cute!!

"I'll be returning these, I was looking for new running shoes that weren't going to cost me to much. I was excited when I found these shoes, and even got more excited when I read the reviews on how they were true to size.

The shoe fit nicely except the ankle area. Sad day, my search for the right shoe continues.",2,0,5.0
"My sister & I both bought a pair of these for the gym, & we love them. I wear them all the time because of how comfortable they are. I usually wear an 8. I ordered an 8 1/2 & they are a little loose, but I don't like them super tight. Definitely recommend!",5,1,5.0

"I'm actively excited to put them on in the morning, which sounds dorky but I'm a dork. I've been looking for shoes with good support because I've been having foot pain and they help a lot. They're super comfortable and fit very well. I absolutely recommend them!!",5,1,5.0
Shoes fit very well. Very comfortable. Great for walking on concrete floors but the tongue of both shoes shift to the side since there is no band to put the laces thru to hold it in place. Meaning you have to stop and adjust them every so often.,5,1,5.0
Very comfortable for working a 10 hour shift on your feet.,4,1,5.0
"I love that these just slip on, but they are kind of ‘wobbly�? As in, the sides are not super sturdy so my foot sometimes rolls off the sole, almost causing me to roll my ankle. Definitely not a shoe to work out in, but for just a slip on and go, I love them!",4,1,5.0
I ordered them because I thought they were Nikes,1,0,5.0
They are cute and functional for daily use. I don’t use them for working out. The only thing I wish they had was a slip strap on the tongue to hold the tongue in the center of the shoe.I find the tongue sliding to the side throughout the day and needs to be readjusted.,4,1,5.0

"I like to run, but I’m tired of buying Nike - they get so run down so quickly (see what I did there?) and lose support and I’ll get injured pretty quickly. These shoes are half the price, and so far they are far more comfortable! I have arch support, cushioning in the heels, and there’s even a little bit of bounce in the toes. It also helps that they’re cute as heck. I may have to order a second pair just for another color! I got the white and light blue.",4,1,5.0
"These are super cute and very sporty, very comfortable for short times. However they are super flat, I ended up having foot pain by the end of the night. I climb stairs all day at work and these aren’t that good for work when you’re on your feet all day",4,1,5.0
Dangerous! These shoes are super cute and fit perfectly but no matter what socks I wear my feet slide around in them like they’re massive. I bought these for a trips to Missouri for hiking and literally had my foot slide/flip sideways in the shoe �? Not fun and painful �?I almost broke my ankles a couple of times. Very unfortunate since they’re cute but not worth the possible injury.,2,0,5.0
"It was not disclosed in the ad that this product is manufactured in china! had I known that, two different scenarios would have occurred. one I would have known that the shoes were going to be too small regardless because China cannot accommodate a wide width foot even if you give them handwritten instructions .

"Shoes came in very nice looking and my wife said that they were comfortable to wear I am very disappointed about how they were sold to me. I had searched air Jordan women’s shoes and found these surrounded by Nike’s with air on the side and thought the Gannou was the store or sellers name not the brand Of shoe. Very misleading product placement. So far my wife says they are ok and they are nice looking but, we thought we were getting Nike air",3,0,5.0
Not a bad pair of shoes for the price. Received many compliments on the style. I’m usually a size 9.5/10 but went with a 9.5 and it fit perfectly. If you have wide feet or they tend to swell I would get a size 10. Used them for my warehouse job where I’m standing or walking all day. First time wearing them was a little uncomfortable but they were comfortable after breaking them in.,4,1,5.0
"Look great! But im a size 7.5 and thats the size i got and there a little big could have probably gotten a 7. I only wore them a little while, not to bad hopefully after i ware them in they get a little more comfortable. But over all pretty happy with them. I would say its worth it. 7/10 is the score i would give",3,0,5.0

"I love running, and I love long distances (favorite racing distances are 10K, 12K, 15K, and half marathons). Back in my high school track-and-field days, I was fitted and told I need to use a specific line of Brooks for support. Eventually I evolved to like Saucony; mainly because they were cheaper but also because the fit...worked? After I started triathlons and Ironmans a few years ago, my miles grew exponentially so I decided to get refitted for a better sneaker once more. I found the Brooks Ghost at that point and was very pleased for nearly 9-ish months. They were a comfortable shoe that fit me well, however I found over time, the lack of ankle support really started to take it's toll. FYI, I change out my shoes roughly every 3-4 months depending on the amount of miles ran. By about last December, I started to get right foot pain after each run. Instead of looking elsewhere, I bought the next generation of Brooks Ghost. This seemed to only worsen the lack of ankle support and regular foot pain after longer distances. Finally, in search of another shoe, I found myself drawn to Nike even though I've never owned a pair of Nikes in my life. RunnersWorld and Triathlon articles have many suggested brands, and I never thought I'd see the day Nike was in their top 10. I must've missed how much Nike has changed their line of runners over the past decade; suggesting that their shoes are now more comfortable and faster. I decided to take a chance with the Air Zoom Pegasus 36. The moment I put these on, they felt AMAZING! Typically any pair of new running shoes needs some time doing low miles to really break them in, however these adorable lime green Pegasus felt like they were made for my feet from day one! I should advise, I do have normal to narrower feet and these fit like a glove. The Pegasus is like a cloud supporting all the right places, springing comfortably with each stride, and VERY lightweight! I was so surprised at the light feel that I put these on an ounce/gram scale to compare with my Ghosts. The Pegasus 36 pair weighed in at 478 grams and the Ghost 12 pair weighed in at 568... a 90g difference! That may not sound like much but when you add miles or do the distance after 90K of biking, shaving off a few grams can make all the difference. On my first run with these I took them to the track and did 8.5 miles, 6.25 of which at race pace. I got some of my fastest times recorded in a long time on the track that day. And bonus, no ankle or foot pain! I also did not need to stretch regularly between splits, because my legs felt amazing! Time will really tell how the Pegasus will hold up against the elements, but to be honest, even if these don't make it as my new, forever running brand, I would be happy to keep these as an everyday walking shoe. They are OH SO COMFORTABLE! Today after my run I actually put them back on to wear at work for a 12-hour shift. I can honestly say I never did that with my Ghosts 11s or 12s. :-)

I'll report back in a few months to advise how these are holding up. ...maybe by then I'll actually get to run a race in these?!?!?! *hopes* That is, if Covid-19 ever calms the fudge down!!!!

Hope y'all stay safe and healthy out there! Cheers!

***5 month update***** I still love the Nike Pegasus 36. Since July I purchased a 2nd pair in pink/black in order to alternate wear. The shoes still feel as comfortable as ever. I have even been able to run two Covid-approved races since October (a 10K and Half Marathon) where I placed 1st place overall female in both! However, I discovered that while I love the light-weight and energy transfer from the Pegasus, I am a greater fan of them with in shorter distances. When reaching the 13 mile mark, my joints feel as those they could use more stability. In a 10K, the Pegasus worked fantastic! I compared a half marathon solo run with the Pegasus then did the same with my old Brooks Ghost. While the Brooks still caused a few blisters and foot pain, my knees and poster kept better than with the Pegasus. I've learned that sometimes too much cushion with less structure can cause more work for the body to maneuver between stride (for me at least). I am still a complete fan of the Pegasus and will continue to use them in training and DEFINITELY for any races shorter than 13.1 miles. However, I am now on the hunt for another shoe that'll go the distance with the same lightness and bounce as the Pegasus but with stability to keep my form in check when I reach those ""greater fatigue miles"".

Thanks for listening! Happy running! :-D",5,1,5.0
I have plantar fasciitis and need to wear shoes with good arch support. I LOVE my Nike shoes. They are light in weight and the insoles are the most important part.,4,1,5.0
I LOVE MY SHOES!! Recently had weightloss surgery and needed a good walking shoe... Boy did i find a good one,5,1,5.0
"I’ve been wearing the Pegasus series for years and they have fit perfectly. I walk, run and kick around in these shoes. This latest in the Pegasus line is good looking but less functional. The overall fit is good except the back top (heel/ankle). It’s as if the shoe gets relaxed there and leaves enough of a gap to allow heel to move hence rub. I tighten the laces and it still happens. Will be investing in different shoes for an upcoming 7K. These will be for short, walking outings around town.",3,0,5.0
"For folks with hard to fit feet or walkers/runners that need the most comfort in a shoe, this is it. I always come back to Nike. This shoe is like walking on marshmallows!
Air Zoom would be the best shoe for everyone, perhaps even elite runners. I tried to use a cheaper shoe but I just wasted my money. This is the shoe you want.",5,1,5.0
"Unbelievable! I ordered these shoes because my knees were killing me when walking with friends twice a day during our social distancing ordeal. I couldn’t go to the store so I ordered the brand I used to run marathons with and they came less than 36 hours later, fit perfectly and I’m back with the walking group. Also, they are mesh and breath so I’m very happy.",5,1,5.0
"Unfortunately, this is the second Nike product I've purchased 'new' through Amazon that arrived worn. The shoe box was damaged and held together with rubber bands and the shoes were clearly worn from prior use. Needless to say I didn't have the desire to even try them on. My first purchase, a Nike drifit shirt wasn't even the right style/size from the photo and smelled like BO. Moral of the story is that I am done purchasing Nike through Amazon.",1,0,5.0
"Right out of the box these fit great - I have Pegasus 32 (owned for 3 years and I've walked 4 miles every day for over a year) and Pegasus Shield 35 (water resistant). Nikes are lightweight and my favorite feel for sneakers. I've tried 4 pairs of Brooks and the feel just isn't the same. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the way the back (collar) scoops downward under the ankle on either side of the shoe. It just didn't cover up enough of my heel, so the shoe shifted off my heel when it left the ground. I knew I would have a rubbed spot on the back of my heel after mile one. Otherwise I loved them, but ended up returning the Nikes and went with the next-best Adrenaline GTS 20 from Brooks.",4,1,5.0
"I purchased these to replace my work shoes. I bought these shoes after ordering the Nike Tanjuns. I wore the Downshifter line, however they have stopped making them. I looked for a shoe similar in style and fit to the Downshifters. The Tanjuns were awful, I felt like my foot had been walking on a flat surface all day. I believe it’s due to no rubber tread at the bottom. I ordered the Pegasus�?after 1 time of wearing the Tanjuns. The Pegasus�?are so comfortable, with lots of padded and rubber support, as well as curvature. They were comfortable on the first day, no need for a “break in�?period. I will be ordering a second pair for recreation.",5,1,5.0
"Difficult to get your foot in. There is a piece of fabric connecting the tongue of the shoe to the body of the shoe (and not just at the bottom of the tongue like on most athletic shoes, but almost all the way up the side to the top of the tongue). This makes it very difficult to get your foot into the shoe. But what's worse, if you have thick socks on or if your feet are a little swollen (as they sometimes are during that time of the month when you're retaining water), loosening the shoelaces to give your foot more room, does no good because the tongue of the shoe is still constraining your foot.

I also don't like the way these shoes lace-up. It's easy to make sure the laces are tight enough but it's impossible to loosen them to any extent (see comment above) making the shoe feel too tight across the instep.

Lastly, the sides of the shoe are cut too low to the point where it feels like your foot is only halfway in the shoe.

I'm really disappointed in this model of Nike.",3,0,5.0
These shoes were used not new and they smelled faintly of vinegar or sweaty feet. They had dirt on the heels and marks on the outside as well. The white cushion at the bottom around the shoe had several creases showing that it was used for more than just trying on. The bottom of the shoes also smelled like flowery hand soap which says to me the bottom of the shoe was washed. Please don’t con your consumers on here this is a valuable service/company which has made raising three young children much easier with their fast delivery services.,1,0,5.0
"Just ran first 4 miles in these. They are comfortable and seem supportive. The toebox is a bit strange. I have normal width feet, not narrow, but when I laced them up, when I pulled the laces tighter on the toebox it puckered the fabric in a strange way (see picture). This didn't seem to affect the functionality but it definitely is a design flaw. Hopefully it doesn't cause any issues over time. As always, I tell people Nikes run SMALL. I always purchase a size bigger than the shoes I normally wear and then it's a perfect fit. I will try to post later about further wear and functionality.",4,1,5.0
My heel slips out even walking so I can't use them to run. They angle my feet causing it to hurt after 5 minutes of walking because the same powerstep inserts perfect for Brooks Ghosts cause me to walk on the outside bones of my feet in these. I had to go out and buy a pair of Brooks instead and these just sit in my bin unused. I hate that I wasted money on them. I tried to wear them to a hockey game and my feet hurt before I even got to my seat. In my Brooks I can jog the block just fine and power walk the treadmill every night for 40 minutes unharmed.,1,0,5.0
"This is my 3rd pair of these.. WONDERFUL shoe - BEWARE OF SELLER - ! The pair shipped to me this time was clearly a floor model or used pair. Packaging was all tore up, toes stretched out, NO inserts. Again, I’ve unpacked this same shoe several times.. beware of seller. Clearly cleaning up used models priced @ NEW !",1,0,5.0
"The Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 34 have always been my go-to shoes, but they're harder and harder to find these days. I figured I would try out the 36 as a comparable model, but in my opinion they run about a half a size smaller, and don't have nearly the same amount of support as the 34 model. Had to return.",3,0,5.0
"This is one of my all time favorite shoes! My favorite color is pink and I love how bright these shoes are. I work long shifts and am always on my feet, these leave my feet comfortable and stylish.",5,1,5.0
"These are so pink! I love them!

Nike Zooms are my favorite running shoes. I clock about 6 miles a day and they never let me down. Bought this hot pink pair to replace my previous pair of Zooms that I completely killed over 2000 run miles in.

These are comfortable out of the box, light weight, no gait correction, and the hot pink and black is to die for. If you have ever loved a pair of Nike Zooms, don’t worry, they’re still great.

Kudos to whichever Amazon employee was responsible for wrapping the shoebox in plastic packaging. It was a rainy day and my shoes were protected until I got home.",5,1,5.0
"These shoes are the bomb dot Com!!!!
I work at a hospital and originally I needed to replace my training nikes because after just a year they got a hole in it (I wear them everyday and walking in the hospital as well) I also work out in them.
These shoes are SO comphy! Just like all the reviews I had read said.
They fit like a glove.
So....great product!!",5,1,5.0
"Although I have not road tested my Nike's yet, I've been purchasing this same style for the last 3 or so years. Generally, I go down to the mall and I receive great customer service from our local Champs store. When malls began to open again, I promptly went to the same store only to find they have closed! Another great Honolulu merchant, out of business.

I was a little reluctant to purchase running shoes online but considered the quality and consistent fit over the years, I ordered and I'm very happy to say, they are everything I expected!",5,1,5.0
"I've been a fan of the 35s, I owned 4 pairs and loved them. When the 36s came out I was hesitant to buy them. With the pandemic going on I couldn't try them on at a store but decided why not. I work in a warehouse that has cement floors and constantly moving. These shoes are amazing! I found my feet hurting a lot less and having more energy. I find that there is extra cushion in the ball of the foot and the heel which is what I need.",5,1,5.0
"I was skeptical buying training shoes online. As a Personal Trainer it’s important to have shoes that perform well under multiple situations such as cardio AND resistance training. The first time I tried them on, they felt slightly tight but after a couple of days of breaking them in they are absolutely perfect! These are really good for agility movements without making my feet shuffle side to side inside the shoes. They are also very comfortable. I may need to purchase a second pair to rotate between two pairs.",5,1,5.0
I was nervous about buying running shoes online but I’m glad that I did! I bought these after having used the Nike Lunarglide running shoes for years. I run 3-5 days a week and about 3-5 miles a day average. I’m so glad that I tried the Nike Zoom shoes!!! They have amazing support and the knee and hip and back pain I was having with run the few months before getting these shoes is gone. I feel great again even after running 7 miles this morning. I love how they feel supportive and lightweight. I will buy these again.,5,1,5.0
"I spend 10-12 hours on my feet at work, so good shoes are a must. I went with the cheaper design in an 11 (I normally wear a 10.5 in Nike) and am glad I did bc these are a little snug in the toes. I do have a wide foot though, so if you're more narrow you could probably do your regular size. I got the grey with tan bottoms bc they were $70 cheaper than the style I wanted, and will definitely be buying these in more colors to match my scrubs. Great shoe, very happy with my purchase",5,1,5.0
"The most comfortable pair of Nikes ever. Got them primarily for my indoor workouts, haven't worn them outside much, yet sadly after less than 9 months, they already have a large hole in the material on top of the toe box area. Maybe there was an issue with this pair that wasn't noticeable until it developed? I'm not sure but I think they should have lasted longer than that.",3,0,5.0
I love these shoes. I was looking for good shoes to wear at work as a nurse working 12 hour shifts. These are very soft and comfortable. Very supportive.,5,1,5.0
"I have an unusual Size. It is hard to find some thing that fits my foot.
I needed A shoe that did not weigh a ton. The shoe is lightweight and conforms to my foot correctly. I basically bought it to wear as a good support you around my house. I have foot issues and it relieved my pain because of the construction of the shoe. So far so good.",5,1,5.0
"I’m doubting the authenticity of these Nikes. I own over 50 pairs of Nikes, all in size 7. These say size 7 on the tag but fit like an 8. They’re HUGE! Why?? I’ve attached a picture to show these on the left next to a similar pair I own on the right that is actually a size 7. I would love to exchange these for a pair that fit, but I just don’t even think they are real Nikes now.",1,0,5.0
"Overall I'm happy with these shoes. The only thing I am not crazy about in the pointed heal. In my opinion it is ugly. I know it is supposed to be more aerodynamic, but unless you are a serious competitive runner, it really isn't necessary. I have worn pegasus shoes for many years now to run, and these are very comfortable and supportive. They feel slightly stiffer than the old pegasus but the weight is nice. I would recommend these shoes. Also they arrived on time but the packaging made me wonder if they had been repackaged or returned. They didn't appear to be worn so I kept them.",4,1,5.0
"I bought these shoes because I loved the color. ( it is a very bright pink ). Having never tried them on, I wasn’t sure if they’d be comfortable. I bought a half size smaller than I normally wear. (81/2 instead of a 9) They are absolutely PERFECT and so comfortable. Im on my feet a lot and these shoes are great. Highly recommend !",5,1,5.0
"These shoes are quite good for runners! I hover around 30 miles per week and run mostly on concrete. These shoes are not too narrow which is sometimes a concern. They fit as expected (I got a woman's 7) and are very comfortable. The colors are exactly as shown in the picture. I prefer the Nike Pegasus Zoom 35, (this is the updated version), but this version is still a great shoe.",5,1,5.0
"I have always ran in Nike's, usually Nike Air Max Triax. I thought these shoes would be great running shoes for my marathon. I tried them on the day I got them and they were tight and the back on the heel area is very low. I knew it would be bad for me. So I printed up a return label.
Yes, I took awhile (a month and a half) to take them to the UPS store because I was finishing grad school and had many late nights and no time to spare. I took them in today and I see a refund issued for $78.79. I paid $95.97. I would not have cared if I didn't get the refund until they received them to verify that they had not been used at all. Maybe they wait until they receive them to issue the full amount but this was not said. I did not get a full refund.",1,0,5.0
"I was really hopeful, when I first tried them on. It felt almost like a cloud. However, in the time of wearing it for a whole two days, that quickly disappeared. I suppose if you’re only needing support casually for a 30 min walk, maybe twice a week, it might be ok. But if you need support for standing and working long hours, forget it.",3,0,5.0
"I'm not a long-long distance runner or I would have had to return these. but since I only run about 3-5 miles a day, these work fine. The ankle is too low on the foot to give an adequate fit for anything longer. You'll get blisters. But they have very good support and are comfortable for short distances.",3,0,5.0
"These shoes are amazing! I tore my Achilles last year and every shoe hurts to wear. These are supportive and flexible enough, they don’t hurt! Thank you Nike!!!!",5,1,5.0
The most comfortable sneaker I have ever purchased. When I walk the sneaker has an awesome shock absorber; this is very important as I am an avid walker six days a week. Nice looking on the outside feels good on the inside.,5,1,5.0
I have run 4x in these and so far so good for 6 miles and under. The arch is really high so I don’t think they will work for me for longer runs because my feet have been a little sore in the arch at the 6 mile point.,4,1,5.0
"I love this show so much! I had the previous version and they fit ok but occasionally rubbed blisters. The updates to the shoe keep it from moving around as much, so no blisters.

"I expected more from Nike. The shoe tended to be slightly smaller for me. I bought them for the arch support which seems ok.

Would not buy again.",3,0,5.0

"This is my second pair of Pegasuses and neither has disappointed. The support is great, they're super comfortable, my feet don't freeze with a light sock on in the winter (I don't run under 35 degrees F), and they don't sweat much if at all in the summer. I love the color, too. I usually wear a size 9 or 9.5 in other shoes but sized up to a 10 for these and they fit perfectly.",5,1,5.0

He want beyond what he should have or had to in order to make sure that I the customer was satisfied and I am. I will be making future purchase with this seller.,5,1,5.0

"I wear nothing but Nike Pegasus and formerly could put on a new pair without breaking them as well as using an orthopedic in them as well. For some reason, these feel much tighter. I make do by eliminating
The extra padding.",3,0,5.0
"Save your money. Not a genuine Nike shoe. Probably a knockoff, copy or second. Poor quality materials, design and construction. Fails poorly in comparison to genuine shoe I already had. Its a ripoff con job!",1,0,5.0
The shoe fits well and is comfortable. However the left tennis shoe is irregular/deformed with a buckle in the material near the ankle. I have taken a photo of right tennis shoe to show the difference.,2,0,5.0
"Go up a half size. I usually wear 8.5, I took a 9 and it fits perfectly. I love this shoe. It looks well made and of a high quality.",5,1,5.0

"I usually wear size 9 in sneakers (nike also), but these feel bigger, the style doesn't look very nice, it definitely wasn't a good buy.",2,0,5.0
"These fit true to size however, if you have a wider foot they might be snug. Nike tends to run that way though. My heels slip a bit but overall I am satisfied with these.",5,1,5.0
THE most comfortable shoes I have ever owned! Great for walking/jogging and seems to take pressure off you legs/back. I hate to take them off to go to bed!,5,1,5.0

"The shoes themselves are great. But I have my concerns with the sellers. My shoes arrived appearing as if they had already been worn. The foam on the bottom was creased, shoelaces were re-laced, and shoe packing was outside of the shoe. I am still enjoying the shoes, but I wish the seller took more care with their products, especially if they are reselling returned items.",3,0,5.0
I'm on my feet all day and wanted a running shoe with support. I felt pretty satisfied with the overall support. It is a bit wider than most Nike shoes.

"This shoes are amazing. A friend of mine recommended me to buy them because they are very light and comfortable to wear and he didn’t lie at all. If you’re looking for shoes to run or walk, these are the best ones. I’ve been wearing them every time I run and they are very soft on your feet. I definitely recommend it.",5,1,5.0
Not enough cushion in the front of the shoe where the ball of the foot is. Kind of disappointing for a running shoe.,3,0,5.0
"This original order did not state that these shoes were a Wide fitting. I only discovered this upon receipt of package and have returned them to Amazon.

"I purchased these as a replacement for what I thought was an identical pair. However, these were not nearly as comfortable and seemed much more cheaply made. Nothing at all like the first pair I purchased.",1,0,5.0
"Best running shoe out there! I have a high arched foot and these running shoes have provided support during my daily 3-5 mile runs. These shoes are perfect for long distance running, sprints, and even at home workouts giving you the support and comfort you need on a daily basis. Definitely recommended 👍🏼",5,1,5.0
I am addicted to nike air zoom Pegasus and these are in my collection! Love them.,5,1,5.0

"These sneeke's fit PERFECTLY! I have a pair just like them , I purchased locally last year. When I saw these on Amazon I ordered them. The fit is perfect!",5,1,5.0

I love Nike Pegasus- these are my 4th pair. However I had to exchange these- for an identical pair- due to the other ones had a defect with stitching coming undone at the tongue in both shoes.,4,1,5.0
"These shoes have a great fit, not too big in the foot bed, they are well cushioned and are well made. If you have a wider foot, you may not like these as much , but these are the pick for me!

It's good just for running. Has no stability for gym Wright or cross training.,3,0,5.0
Did not fit. I wore this model for years. Left when it changed last year. Thought I’d try it again. The size I always wore is now too small and the ball of my foot hurts after only a few minutes on. Seems like a great show. Love the color! It’s just not the shoe for me anymore.,2,0,5.0
These are exactly what I wanted/needed. Fit perfect! Third Pair!,5,1,5.0

"Neutral, flexible, and ability to train effectively with feeling the road without too much spring cushioning that inhibits turning tight corners & working harder with speed interval work during short training runs.

"This was my first real shoe investment getting back into running as an adult (ran cross country in high school years ago but was out of practice). I typically do light 3-5mi runs, at high altitude/mountainous terrain and wanted something that could help with fatigue as I got back into shape. Bought these in a fancy running store, they came highly recommended by one of the staff and I can see why. Great running shoes, light and breathable. Just wore them today running in the snow, they worked fine with wool socks and a pair of yak trax, but did get a little wet after a while. I'm investing in the waterproof shield version next for those wet cold runs!",5,1,5.0
"These are not the same as the original Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36 produced by Nike. The tongue is sewed so that you can't move it, and the cushioning is inferior. The price when you finally order turns out to be an outrageous $150. They won't fool me again.",1,0,5.0
"HI! I am division 1 cross country/track runner and run between 60-70 miles per week (ps this is my dads account but I am a girl) (and I also have flat feet and custom orthodics) and the zoom peg 36’s are not the move in my opinion, I LOVE my 34’s and continue to buy 34’s! The 36 feels cheap and I do NOT recommend for distance running:( I will be returning mine and getting my 34s again, also I have custom orthodox and the 36 still felt so unstable",1,0,5.0

"They look nice but something is not right about the fit in the back of the shoes. They don’t hug my heels like sneakers should so when I walk around in them, I constantly feel as if my heels are going to slide right out of the shoes. I have to wear longer socks than I normally would to keep them from sliding off my feet in the shoes. If I had the patience to deal with returning them I would. Other than that, they look nice and they are comfortable. I probably won’t be wearing them often though because the heels are so annoying.",3,0,5.0
"NIKE has changed Pegasus. The arch is way too forward and vey thick. I am a size 7 and buy size 8.
In the past, they have designated this shoe type as running with perfect arch, not pronators and not too thick.
Now they fit like a Rebock which are too thin for me.

"I am a Nike shoe fan and have been in the Pegasus for at least 3 versions now, maybe four. This one, the 36, is my least favorite. The sole and cushion are reliable and what I don’t like is the upper material. It’s extremely stretchy and flexible, providing barely any protection from rolling an ankle. This makes it strictly a running shoe, unfit for cross training or any movement side to side. Be careful hopping up curbs or aside of a puddle!",3,0,5.0

"I ran track and cross country in high school and own about 8 pairs of the exact same shoe-- just in different colors. Sadly, Nike quit making the shoe I had fallen in love with so I had to find a new pair. I didn't want to spend a fortune on running shoes, so when I came across these I was intrigued. I love them. The support is great and they match everything with the neutral colors. I wear these shoes to workout or run as well as wearing them to most everyday occasions. Great pair of shoes!!!",5,1,5.0
"I bought these because the were on sale. I’ve had these shoes before and they are so amazing! I have back and hip pain from sitting at my desk job. As a runner, I’ve worn so many running shoes over the years. I’ve paid $160 or more for Brooks, new balance, ASICS and other Nike but these are my favorite! Great cushion and great heel support that helps relive that lower back pain. I recommend going a 1/2 size up with Nike.",5,1,5.0

"These shoes fit as expected. They are very comfortable and very lightweight. Brand new, they were very stylish. I really enjoyed the shoes. That being said,

I bought these for work. I'm in IT and our floors are concrete. If I walk in the city for lunch, it's less than 1mile a day on sidewalk, if at all.

After about 5 months of daily semi-daily wear to work (where I mostly sit down), the tread on the bottom of these shoes disappeared. The lightweight effect is a trade-off for durable tread.

Nike's shoes made for walking/running never did this to me (except for long distance hikes for 1-2 years). I was walking on the sidewalk a morning after rain the night before and fell flat on my ass! The tread is mostly worn off the in the parts where there is 0 visible remaining tread, there are actually divers which I believe are capable of growing into actual holes.

Overall, I liked the shoes, but considering I didn't put a lot of miles on them, I would have liked to get more than 5 months for a $60 pair of shoes.",3,0,5.0

My best suggestion is order from somewhere else or make sure you’re spot on about the size you’re ordering. Basically, as it stands I’m stuck with a shoe that doesn’t fit my toddler. Good luck!",1,0,5.0
"I purchased these to replace my work shoes. I wore the Downshifter line, however they have stopped making them. I looked for a shoe similar in style and fit to the Downshifters. The Tanjuns were awful, I felt like my foot had been walking on a flat surface all day. I believe it’s due to no rubber tread at the bottom. I ordered the Pegasus�?after 1 time of wearing the Tanjuns. The Pegasus�?are so comfortable, with lots of padded and rubber support, as well as curvature. They were comfortable on the first day, no need for a “break in�?period. Unfortunately after wearing these once, I will be throwing them away. I can’t return them because the bottom doesn’t have any rubber sole, it’s completely white/sponge material, so they look worn after one occasion. I would recommend spending the extra money and getting the Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36.",2,0,5.0

"Most of my shoes are and have been Nike and I've never had an issue until this pair. Most of the time I pick up the previous year's style for around $60 to $100.

I picked up this pair to keep at work to go out and get some steps in... fifteen minutes here and there. The first thing I noticed was that there was no arch support. No biggie, I'm not running a marathon. After I couple of walks I notice my left knee has a slight pain. A few more walks later I realize that the left shoe rolls out from under my foot and my over correction is what is putting extra strain on my knee.

At this point, only wearing the shoes maybe two dozen times or so, while holding the shoe upside down you can see why my foot is rolling inwards

All the time I try to tell my mom she needs to buy better quality shoes, that if you take care of your feet they will take care of you. I guess karma got me! I tried to save $20 and probably got the one pair with a defect... or did I?",1,0,5.0
"These are my favorite Nikes and I have 3 pairs. One is a women’s 7.5 and the others are boy’s 5.5. They all fit the same ( I think Nike runs small and I have wide feet, so I get a half size up). The fabric is stretchy and these are so easy to machine wash. I wear them to work often and they hold up well. I work in retail full time and I’m on my feet 8-12 hours daily. I’m also in my 40’s with heel spurs and sciatica. Good shoes are life changing!",5,1,5.0
"I needed a new pair of running shoes and saw all the high reviews on this Nike shoe. The high reviews plus the affordable price for me sold on this shoe. I typically buy a half size larger due to the fact of my feet swelling while I run. I will say I felt like I was running on pillows. The shoes are som comfortable for running, I felt like I could run for hours. The only thing I would suggest is buying a half size larger because they do run a tad bit small. Other than that I have no complaints. I have to update my review. At first these running shoes were som comfortable, however since using these new pair of shoes, I’ve had constant problems with my ankles,, and toes going numb. If you have wider feet, I DO NOT recommend this shoe. Waste of my money",2,0,5.0

"UPDATE: Fantastic for walking!

I love the fit and the feel of this sneaker. It is light and flexible and yet still they feel very supportive. I purchased these for an upcoming trip to Berlin where I anticipate a lot of walking so I will updated it when I get back. But based on the feel so and look so far I love it.

The white on white is super minimalist which allows it to be super versatile. I’m planning on bring only one other pair of shoes.",5,1,5.0
"I was trying to find a running shoe with arch support but these have absolutely none, as they are all fashion and no function. The footbed is hard and flat as a board (see pics). If anything they make your foot overpronate because the inside arc of the outer shoe is fashionably carved out. They are cute but I would mess up my feet pretty bad running in these. Mine also came with a perforation in the toe area so I’ll probably end up returning. Not the quality of “running shoe�?one would expect after dropping $80.",2,0,5.0
"I’m conflicted over these shoes. They look nice and they fit my 13 year old well (size 7.5) but the toe and top of foot area has no support at all. It’s just a thin material with the netting on top so these are good for light wear like school or leisurely walking but not for anything more than that as they won’t protect that area at all if something falls on it.
Of course they’re not supposed to be steel toe quality but this is the thinnest I’ve ever seen in an athletic shoe for any of my family and this is Nike. I would expect better quality than this.
Also, whoever designed this paper thin butterfly wing tongue design WITH breathable basketball short type holes throughout the whole middle needs to be fired. It’s terrible. It’s too hard to pull up and keep in place with your hand while trying to hold onto the back of the shoe to slip onto your foot. And like I said, it’s paper thin so I suspect it will rip in the weaker side areas way before the rest of the shoe wears out which in turn, will render the shoes completely useless and unwearable.

He says he will keep them because he likes the color and fit but I really feel like I will have to be replacing them within a few months whereas his usual Nike that I buy lasts him a complete school year.
Not worth the $60 price tag on them at all! Not even close!!
Shop for a different shoe!",2,0,5.0
"As someone with wide feet it’s hard to find cute good quality walking shoes. I bought this in my usual size 9 W wide width and to compare I got the asics gel excite 7 since that brand is known for fitting wide feet comfortably. The nikes were comfortable straight out of the box, but I could feel the side of my foot already stretching over the edge of the footbed. The material is quite breathable and stretchy so I’m not sure how long it’ll take for me to wear down the sides. Also in the inside heel portion of the shoe insert just seems like it’ll give out and become loose. Overall it’s a good casual shoe, I wouldn’t run or go long distances with these and expect them to hold up for a long time. They are as advertised a good casual shoe to run errands. The ASICS have a sturdier exterior, not much stretch but they do fit my wide feet comfortably. I feel secure when walking/ jogging. If you have wide feet and want something casual then the Nikes are great. For more athletic shoes go with ASICS. They’re not as cute as these Nikes but your feet will thank you.",3,0,5.0
"Soo bad. Never buying Nike again. The bottom is made out of some sort of foam and all of the tread wore off in a couple months with moderate use. The grip is comically bad when the ground is a little wet- it's like walking on ice. It also let's water in with no resistance at all, and doesn't let the water back out. It's very lightweight, however because it's made of just foam and cheap mesh. I'm sticking to Asics.",1,0,5.0
"I would have rated these a 5 star however the shipping took a very long time especially since I paid additional shipping costs since this seller does not offer the amazon free shipping but instead charges additional shipping and handling. I paid the additional shipping charges March 1st and STILL did NOT receive them until today March 17th. Too long and should include free shipping because of the time involved sending and receiving them. They are quite nice Authentic and very comfortable as well as true to size . These really are a quality product you can use for everyday, including errands, walking (exercise), working out at gym or home but not for running or jogging. I will follow up in a few months on the durability and if these are still comfortable. They are SO lightweight on your feet which is quite nice on a busy day. Enjoy!",3,0,5.0

Really great shoes except for the security sensor still attached. The box was also torn and held together with a rubber band. It kind of makes me wonder if these were stolen and being resold.

"I LIVE in these sneakers. Never have I owned sneakers with zero break-in time. NONE at all.
I walk 6-8 miles a day and they are terrific. No foot pain anywhere, no tiredness, great level of comfort and support.

My 2 issues are
1. (A petty whine here) Laces are soooooo long.
2. (bigger issue) They wear out in about a month for me. I have bought 4 pairs since May (just started on pair 4). I noticed the circular rubber grips on the sole begin to wear in 3 days and are totally gone/flat in week 3-4. Gone. Completely. Smooth as a baby’s bottom. That’s about 150 miles so I’m thinking it’s my regiment and not the shoes, per se. Still, $65 a month on walking/running sneakers is steep.
The immediate comfort is worth it to me because I have a huge issue with blisters. As a woman with a wider foot from a severe break years ago, I order a men’s size 8. They fit tightly from the padding for the first 10 miles and then get relaxed inside but don’t order up - you’ll be sliding around in them.

the design is darling (i ordered the black with rose gold detail) and i sooo wish they’d worked for me. looks just like the image. arrived on time as well, just terribly sized.

These shoes came through I work for amazon and on my feet for at least 11 hours a day. Feet feel so much better with these shoes. But I also wear compression socks. The combination is magic.

"These are my everyday, go-to sneakers. Lightweight and super comfortable, but the sizing is quirky. I normally wear a 7 1/2 shoe with stockings or bare feet. I always buy Nike sneakers in a size 8 to accommodate my socks, but I had to buy these sneakers in an 8 1/2 because the fabric in the toe box upper is too snug.

I bought these sneakers in the usual half size larger. Although they were fine in the store, I was never able to fully enjoy them at home. I gave away my hardly ever used Tanjuns. If your toes need wiggle room, get these sneakers in a full size larger than your shoes.",5,1,5.0
I wear a women’s size 8 but always purchase big kids size 7 in Nike because they are significantly less expensive. I love this brand!

Lol. I am literally on my feet for 8-16 hours per day!
So, I went online and typed “most comfortable Nike shoe,�?and this one popped up, and the reviews were on target! I can honestly say that these are the most comfortable shoe I could have ever purchased! The only thing I would mention is that they run about a 1/2-1 size too small.

These are FAKE!!!. Bought twice and both times they got a hole within one month of daily wear in the toe of the shoe. See photos. Also inside they wore through and had pieces sticking out.. I loved the rose gold swoosh and had an original/real pair that lasted over 18 months or longer with no issues - which I bought from Academy.

"This is my second pair of that exact same color. The first pair lasted me about a year or two with heavy everyday use. It's a classic look and pairs well with many outfits. The shoes are comfortable to walk in and are super lightweight.

I also have this same style of Nike's in white and another in grey. I'm a big fan.",5,1,5.0

"These are THE MOST comfortable shoes EVER! It’s like you’re walking on clouds! I’m between a 6.5 - 7 & it was recommended to get the 7’s & I’m SO GLAD I did! They don’t rub the back of my ankles like other shoes do, and I managed to keep them on the entire day!! The netting that the shoe is made of actually ventilates air on to your feet!! You just can’t go wrong with these shoes!! Who doesn’t want STYLE ~ COMFORT & TONS OF COMPLIMENTS!!?? :)",5,1,5.0
"I bought these because they are light weight and breathable . I Just starting wearing them for indoor Pickleball and pleased because they are indeed light weight NOT not clunky. I’ve switched from Asics which are all now heavy , clunky and aren’t good for competitive sports",5,1,5.0
"I love these shoes so much. Not only are they cute and stylish, but I've never had any foot pain when I wear them. I tend to go on 2-4 mile walks and these hold up and protect my feet from getting sore. I will definitely order another pair in the future! Well worth the price.",5,1,5.0

"The bottom around the toe came apart after a few wears (maybe 3-4 times). Since it wasn't new, I could return. Super glue fixed it.

Fit a little tight in length and width. The arch support isnt great. Seems like you sink into the memory foam and then there is no support. As a person with arch problems, I couldn't wear them for walking, whichnis why I got them.",2,0,5.0
Not as advertised. Photo was black on black with white sole. I received black with white Nike and white sole. Which sucks since I already own that pair. Wanted black on black with white sole. These are very comfortable great shoes just didn’t receive color scheme as pictured in photo. PITA,4,1,5.0
bought a 7EE and a 6.5 reg width for comparison and because the EE only comes in black. SAME FOOTBED AND SOLE! but the extra wide had more mesh upper material and was significantly roomier. keeping both cuz they are cute but the EE more tolerable and accomodated a bunion. had to break them in for a day or so but good shoe for nike which does not cater to special orthopedic needs. these are the only nike shoes i can wear comfortably.,4,1,5.0
"My son really loved these shoes. They were very comfortable and probably still are to him. It's only been a month or so since we got them. Today I just happen to look down and see them fraying at the seems. The sole was peeling off as well. I have to say, this is a record for shoes being wore out so quickly. Lesson learned...read the negative reviews and not just the positive ones.",2,0,5.0
Great pair of shoes but I suggest getting them from a different seller. These arrived loose in a bag not in its original box. Had these been a gift id have been livid. I was lucky and they arrived undamaged but it could have easily turned out worse.,3,0,5.0
"Soooo comfy! The first pair of shoes I have worn that were comfortable from the second I stepped into them! Great breath ability too. I have very wide feet, high arches and insteps. Nike shoes NEVER fit me properly because they usually have a very narrow toe box. I ordered the extra wide (2E) and they don't need to be broken in or worn a few days to feel good. They are the best tennis shoes I think I have ever worn!!!",5,1,5.0
Initial order shoe had ink tag still attached. Returned and replacement shipped right out. The show is comfortable from the get go and well made. Must run a bit on the short side so ordered a half size up which is perfect for my orthotics. I highly recommend this shoe and this seller!!,5,1,5.0
"I love these shoes. I buy the same style over and over for running. Light weight and cute, come in many different colors. The only down fall would be the lack of arch support. I wear with inserts so I don't have any problem, I want to make clear that I do not give the arch support 5 stars.",5,1,5.0
"Purchased a pair of these in black on black and loved them so much so I ordered these. The tongue on these is a bit more flimsy than the black ones I have but they are soft, light, and comfortable beyond belief. They feel like an extension of my own foot. I’m pretty active working out 3-4x a week with a trainer and walking or jogging 2 miles a day. They’ve held up well and with my job as a nurse doing 7-10k steps a night, my feet feel good at the end of my shift. I wear a 7.5 and have always worn 8’s because I thought I needed extra room for swelling after my shift but the 7.5 is perfect. Feels like a sock!!",5,1,5.0
"These are one pair of good looking shoes that skimp in the they-feel-like-a-well-made-product department. Some of what was subtracted to makes these shoes light weight, and they are that, compromises my three stars rating so I should stop writing before I change it to two.",3,0,5.0
"I purchased these shoes based totally on reviews , and I am so glad i did. I have had 8 Achilles tendon surgeries on right foot and needed comfort and stability for walking. I usually wear padded slippers all day due to shoes rubbing on Achilles tendon causing excruciating pain. These shoes fit perfectly and the comfort is beyond anything I expected especially with my injury. From the moment I put these on I was in love. I will never buy another brand of tennis shoes this is my go to shoe. Please try for yourself as you can return if unsatisfied.",5,1,5.0
I purchased a pair from Kohls but then saw Amazon sold for a cheaper price. I bought these taking a risk of receiving fakes. Once these arrived in the mail I compared them and scrutinized every bit of detail to the ones from Kohls. My conclusion is that these are 100% real and not fakes at all. For the price it's a great deal! A plus to this was the shoes came brand new. Bottom of shoes were completely white.,5,1,5.0

PS she also likes the style!!!!",5,1,5.0
"I read an article that these were great for people who stand all day and provides good support, and they've done exactly that. I took out the insoles and put in my orthotics and they've been great for walking and standing. Highly recommend.",5,1,5.0
Ordered black with white swish for my son. His current shoes were size 11 and he were starting to get a little tight and worn so I ordered a size 12. They are smaller than his size 11 shoes! Unfortunately I can no longer get another pair in a bigger size.,2,0,5.0

"Dude, I bought these to work out, which I haven't really gotten around to yet, but I'd ordered another pair of dress shoes along with them, and I walk quite a bit, so they made my heels hurt, and I got shin splints. So I decided to wear these for a more casual occasion, and they are so comfortable! I'd been wearing dress shoes for like two years straight, walking miles a day, and these made such a difference. They're also pretty cute! I work at a hotel, and they didn't seem too out of place with my uniform, and I've gotten a lot of compliments!",5,1,5.0
"I have bought this style of Nikes at least 5 times, always 7.5. These ones are so tight even my toes hurt. After wearing them for three days, my feet hurt more than wearing my old shoes. I’m so disappointed after spending $80 on a new work/walking shoe ☹️",2,0,5.0
"The tongue of this shoe is pretty cheap. It's a small gripe, but it is something that you notice immediately. Also, the arch support is pretty week. I wouldn't wear these to actually run in, but they are comfortable enough and look good to just wear out and about while running errands or something.",3,0,5.0
"Very comfortable, good fit. However, the fabric needs to be stronger. After six months, my big toes went thru the fabric,
and now there's a hole. For the price, the shoe fabric should last longer. I wore them a few times a week, not all day, and not everyday.",3,0,5.0
Good fit and very light weight. Plenty of room for my orthotics once you removed the back part of the insole. I can also wear heavy socks with them.,4,1,5.0
"I have bought this shoe before at Academy. Was a little skeptical about ordering online, but the order is just what I needed Fits perfectly. I like the dark sole, because I wear them to work in an office and they do not look like athletic shoes at a distance.

For show only. If you want a kids shoe that lasts ...this is not it. I've spent half the money on shoes for my grandsons and they have stood up far better than these. Purchased only 2 months ago and they look a year old. Definitely will not be able to pass these down to the next one! Disappointing.,2,0,5.0

No problems whatsoever besides the logo on the Tongue of the shoe peeling off within the first week on one shoe and then the same happening a few days after to the other shoe. It doesn’t look bad. You wouldn’t be able to tell unless you really were looking for it.",4,1,5.0
"Fantastic shoe for activity! Very light weight making it perfect for running or aerobics. I love the mesh fabric Dash it really allows my feet to breathe nicely.It has a very slim look to it and doesn’t make my feet look wide, but it still supports very well.Looking forward to buying more in different colors!",5,1,5.0

"These shoes are super light and comfortable. The mesh is breathable and keeps my feet cool while the padding cushions and supports my feet. Makes them good for walking and light workouts.

"These shoes are amazing. I owned a different pair of Nike running shoes that always made my feet fall asleep unless I had the laces so loose they were giving me blisters. But I thought I would give Nike another shot and I absolutely love these shoes, so comfortable!!",5,1,5.0
The fit has been great from the start. My feet ache a bit sometimes after I've been wearing them for a while (i'm on my feet a lot at work) - and i attribute the aches to the fact that I previously wore shoes that aren't as well made as these. They are worth every penny (and nice that i got them on sale :) ) I will definitely buy Nike in the future,5,1,5.0

"My first pair I got from a lost and found... They were well used and who knows how long the previous owners had them. I wore those shoes everyday for 2 years.

They are light weight, well ventilated and extremely comfortable, so I just had to get another pair! This time I got to pick the color though... Seeing as the ones I found were purple, haha.",5,1,5.0
Fast shipping. Perfect condition. Fit as expected. I loved all the color options for this shoe.

I love the style and look of these shoes! They’re very lightweight and comfortable for a wide foot. I have plantar fascitis and feel like they also offer good support for that. The one complaint I have is that the mesh material lets water in the shoe and therefore I can’t wear these when it’s damp or raining.,4,1,5.0

I ordered a half size larger as I always do with Nikes. They fit perfect. The heel is stiff so I have to wear higher socks to cover my ankle but over all they look great and feel great.,4,1,5.0

"I couldn’t wait for them to come and after the first try to the store and back I couldn’t stand it.
They are very high in the back and it gave me very ugly blisters. I don’t know if I can send them back after I used them one time. The back does not have a lot of cushion and being very high that creates a very uncomfortable fit . I am so sorry .... I cannot even walk ; running will be impossible.",1,0,5.0
I love these shoes. At first it did rub blisters on my heals. But after a few days of wearing them they aren’t as tight and are broke in perfect.,5,1,5.0
These run SMALL.,3,0,5.0
I generally wear an 8 in shoes and an 8.5 in athletic sneakers/runners. I got these in an 8.5 and they fit quite well - EXCEPT - wow is there something wrong with the way the backs of these shoes curve. Right into your achilles tendon with exceptional force. I saw other people mention this in their review but I didn't think I'd have a problem with it because I always wear socks with a very cushioned heel tab. You can see the black stripe on my sock heel in my photos- it's right where this hits my achilles tendon. And it does not help. At all. These were so painful. Even just standing - not even moving - they dig in and hurt. I only lasted a minute or two wearing these around my house before I packed them up for a speedy return. I'd only recommend these if you don't have achilles tendons.,2,0,5.0
"I know my bad review is strange since these are my second pair. I’ll explain�? I bought my first pair at Kohl’s and I was stuck with them because I wore them outside sooo I went through very uncomfortable long walks & workouts with horrible blisters on both heels (caused by the high heel design and rough material) until eventually they became bearable while I continued looking for a new pair. (clearly I haven’t been successful). I’ve had them for 1 1/2 years and they finally fit to the point I’m not uncomfortable but the cushioned footbed is flat & worn & I have a hole in the front left shoe so I need a new pair. I would normally never walk around with a hole in my shoe but I’m having a hard time finding a new pair. I finally decided to order these, I wasn’t excited to get the same exact shoe but thought I’d go up 1/2 size , that would definitely help and deal with it. I’m not convinced I will keep them. I feel even though I went up a 1/2 size I’m still going to get blisters. At this point I need to go into a store and try them on which I’ve done several times 🤫 After reading a lot of reviews (after I received) it seems it’s a design flaw for the blister issues! Also, I remember when I bought my first pair I thought they were super comfortable, that was NOT the case once I went out on a 2 hour walk😭 I know everyone has different feet these might work for some people but not for me. I don’t want to get stuck with another pair.",3,0,5.0
"The other reviews regarding the narrow/uncomfortable heel are somewhat accurate, but consideration needs to be given to the breaking-in period. Yes, the heels will pinch you during the first few wears, but you can break in the shoes by wearing them around the house with thick socks. Once these sneakers are molded to your feet, they are extremely comfortable with superior cushioning. If you're looking to wear a pair of sneakers out of the box, I would pass on these. If you're willing to be just a little more patient, you'll be rewarded in spaces. I would absolutely buy these again.",4,1,5.0
"These are going to fit my two left feet so well. NOT. Received two shoes, one is a size 8, the other is a size 9. Both are for the two left feet that I didn’t know I had which are apparently two different sizes. Cute shoe but can’t comment on anything else but looks. Also, my right foot feels slighted. Return.",1,0,5.0
"They are super cute. I went for a power walk, right away I felt my Achilles being dug into. I figured it may loosen up. I ordered 8.5, sizing is accurate. I tried different socks to avoid the friction and my Achilles being dug into. The part that touches Achilles is hard and sharp. If I can’t walk in them I sure can NOT run in them. Maybe it’s just the white pair and how they are designed. Sadly, I will have to return them.",2,0,5.0
"These shoes were uncomfortable the minute I put them on. Hard soles, not bouncy. Usually, with a new pair of shoes, as soon as you put them on they feel great. The part that sticks up above the heel is stiff and cuts in to my lower back leg. The top of the tongue material felt uncomfortable as well, as though there is a seam there. I have nothing good to say about these sneakers.",1,0,5.0
"Super cute shoes, but I had to return because they were too small. I wear a 7.5 and bought an 8. Size up",4,1,5.0
"This is the first time I have ever considered that I may have gotten a fake item on Amazon. I own these exact shoes in a size 8 that i purchased from Finish Line, i only had them a few months and they got quite dirty so i ordered the same pair from Amazon and i cant even get my foot into the size 8. The shoe is also very hard and stiff, Ive never experienced something like this before.",1,0,5.0
"Runs small. Nikes are the only running shoes I wear because of their arch support. Unlike their other shoes, however, these have no arch support. They are very padded, but still require an arch insole. Also, most of their shoes have a notch out of the heel to make a crescent shape and allow room to move. These have a heel that makes an arch high up on the heel and makes blisters in less than 20 minutes of wearing. Poor design and will make me think carefully before purchasing this brand in the future.",2,0,5.0
"Light weight and they look great. Not as narrow as Nike shoes that I had before which was a concern. They're actually a little roomy.

I was able to wear them for hours right away. Will definitely consider others in this line.",5,1,5.0

"These shoes run very small. I ordered a half size larger than I usually wear due to other people saying they run small, and they still did not fit well, still very tight.
The shoe is really a nice looking shoe, but I just couldn't deal with how tight they fit and had to return them.",3,0,5.0
"I loved these shoes when I first got them, but now they started making a clicking noise when I walk and it’s very disappointing!! I purchased these because I had another pair just different color that just wore out. Other than the noises when I walk they are just like my others.",2,0,5.0
"I liked the style, the cushion, and the comfort of the shoe. However, after walking on them for a few minutes, my feet began to feel like they were being pushed/slid forward, hitting against the front, which made my toes sore. I am returning these shoes.",2,0,5.0
"I rarely write reviews but I had to for these. These shoes look great and at first feel great. However, after two weeks of running in them, I started developing shin splints. I've had them and have ran in them for two months now and have to consistently deal with shin splints. The one year old shoes I had before these never gave me any shin splints.

For context, I run around 11 miles per week.",1,0,5.0
"The shoe is beautiful, but it is just too small. I wear a size 9 but this is extremely tight and I cannot wear socks with the shoes. Will probably need to order at least a half size up for these to be comfortable.",4,1,5.0
Really cute and came fast. Great support and comfortable but I had to return them because they were too tight. They didn’t really match with my uniform either so I never got around to ordering another pair,5,1,5.0
Horrible experience buying running shoes online. I wore them once for a 3 mile walk/run and they tore my feet apart.

They rubbed horrible blisters into the back of my heels in 20 mins.

How is one supposed to break them in when you can’t walk in them for more than 10 mins? Pick another pair.",2,0,5.0

"I purchased identical shoe directly from nike store last year, I figured buying from Amazon I would get same product but it's at least a size and a half smaller than my authentic nike from the store. I checked size on label in both sets of shoes and both are 9.5 so I have to assume the pair from Amazon are not real Nikes.
Trying to return them is not easy because I have no way to make labels for returning😣",1,0,5.0
"I just purchased my second pair. The comfort in the heel support is amazing and why I love these so much. The do run extremely small. I’m always a size 8 and I wear an 8 1/2 in these and they fit just perfect, so if you need a little more room I would suggest going up to a 9. They’re not overly bulky looking or feeling, and fit great and look great with leggings and skinny jeans. Nike shoes tend to run narrow. Glad I found these.",5,1,5.0
"They are comfortable other than they are very high and very stiff at the Achilles tendon area at the back of the shoe. The arch support is good but the shoes are painful after a while. I'm working 12-hour shifts and needed moleskin to cover open blisters after 4 hours and I bled into the shoes, even with higher socks. Perhaps these are designed as more of a fashion shoe, probably comfortable to run errands but not good for working on your feet.",3,0,5.0
"This beautiful sneaker was a gift, so I was REALLY upset that they were too small. I've worn Nikes size 9 for years, so why do these fit so poorly? Even worse, I wore them outside, so no exchange...",1,0,5.0
"I love Nike shoes, but these ones missed the mark. The back (as stated in many reviews) of the shoes are very stiff. I got blisters the first several times I wore them, hoping to break them in. It only semi worked, but are still so uncomfortable on my heels, that I don’t even try to wear them anymore. I regret buying them, which is sad to say. Also: if you are still going to gamble this purchase, size up...they run about a half a size small.",2,0,5.0

" These sneakers are so comfortable & cushioned from the heal to the ball of the feet. I'm ecstatic. They run a whole size small. I wear a 6.5 & ordered a 7 and my toes are right at the tip of the shoe, put on socks and it's a tight fit. I'm returning for a 7.5",5,1,5.0
Okay so these shoes are comfortable but I would suggest upping one size for comfort. I have wore this for 3 days now and I got blisters kn the second day. It does not seem to get any more comfortable than what it was the first day. I will probably be exchanging it for a bigger size.,3,0,5.0

These are literally the most comfortable sneakers I’ve bought in a very long time. I’m on my feet 12-13 hours a a day Nursing. They never had the weird break in period that make your feet uncomfortable. I’m beyond happy with these and will buy them again regularly. I read reviews and bought 1/2 size bigger than usual and they fit perfect.,5,1,5.0
I love this shoe. It fits snug to my narrow foot so I can feel save that I will not brake an ankle running. If you have wide foot then these are not the shoes for you. Normal foot wearers may need a size up. I love them!!!,5,1,5.0
Very comfortable. Really happy with it.,4,1,5.0

"Very comfortable but little arch support. Unfortunately I need arch support and these are a very flat sole with light cushion to absorb some impact. I honestly cannot imagine using these for high impact or for an extended period. I think they would be fine for lifting or low-impact workouts but I would not use them for running.

The upper is very comfortable and I like a roomy toebox and don’t want things touching my toes.

Overall, fit as expected.",3,0,5.0
"I love Nike products, and this shoe is no exception. The fit is great, they are very comfortable to walk in (I walk an average of 3 miles a day) and I have no problems with wearing them all day long.",5,1,5.0
"I always buy new Nike Trainers when my old ones get worn.

I hate these compared to the last 2 pairs I bought...

I agree with what everyone is saying about the tongue pressing into the top of your foot. Also, the heel sits a little low in the back, doesn't feel like the shoe is securely on. In general, there's no structure or support to these shoes.

I'm still going to keep these... I live in a pretty remote area in Asia. The sneaker selection here has small sizing. And it would take me 1 month to get something different from Amazon shipped here, so I'm settling bigtime.

I clearly wouldn't recommend these to anyone. If you have other options, take them! Spend your money elsewhere.

Honestly, I'm not even sure if I'll buy Nike Trainer's ever again if this is the direction their design is going. I thought it was a brand I could trust and I was wrong.",1,0,5.0
I loved the Nike Flex Trainer 8. I own 3 pairs of them and really like the fit. However this iteration of the Nike Flex Trainer #9 is AWFUL. They changed the way your arches are supported and the tongue rubs painfully against the top of your foot. It even feels cheap. DO NOT BUY this Nike style. You will have to end up returning it like I am.,1,0,5.0
Adorable style but awful fit. I wear an 11 but have to size up to 12 in Nike because they run small. Tried these on and they were baggy in the heel which is so weird..but tight across the top. And poor support doesnt feel like much padding in the sole.,2,0,5.0
"These are really cute, very light, but the area where the shoes tie is very uncomfortable, it rubs even with socks on. The fabric is so thin you are rubbing right against all the ""hardware"" there. Kind of a dumb design, the ""tongue"" doesn't protect like it should. I really don't recommend these.",3,0,5.0
"I wear these shoes for HIIT workouts, weight lifting and workout classes. They are so light and comfortable! I was pleasantly surprised for the cost! I usually wear heavier, running shoes and I'm so happy I tried something new. I ordered 8 Wide, based off others reviews and I'm glad I did. I normally wear size 8 or 8.5 and the 8 fit perfect. I would suggest playing with the shoe laces and shoe tongue to get your perfect fit. I initialy thought the fit hurt the top of my foot, but after multiple adjustments, it fits like a glove, so don't get mad like I did when I first put them on.",5,1,5.0
"I love, love, loved the way these look on my feet. I tried so hard to make them work by wearing thin socks and wearing them even though they were literally pinching my feet, hoping they’d stretch. At the end of the day, the reviews are correct. The bottom of the tongue area is simply too tight. No amount of adjusting can fix that. Had to return. So sad!",3,0,5.0
"i have had 3 pairs before these, love them. i wear 3 hrs a day at work, even gardening at work. hold up super well, under harsh cond. water, mud, dirt. this flex is nice, like a flexible back heel part, easy to slip in out of. i like them unlike other posts say. colors brite so nice. great shoe. i will cont. to buy yr after yr .",5,1,5.0
"These are very good looking shoes. However, the fit is tight and there is absolutely no give or ability to stretch out. The material appears to be stretchy, but in actuality it feels more like canvas and doesn't stretch.
I ordered a 6 1/2. My normal size is a 6 and these were still too tight. I'm disappointed because I wore them outside (and they hurt my feet within the first hour )and so I can't return them.
Big bummer.",3,0,5.0
"I wear a women's shoe size 12 so finding shoes that are comfortable and don't make my feet ""look"" larger than they are is very (very) challenging. These look great. They are very lightweight. I wear them to the gym for weight training but do not think they are appropriate for running. The bottom rubber sole seems a bit too soft and small rocks like to jam and get stuck. Other than that, I really like this sneaker. The color of the material is unique, sort of a blend between gray and silver with black trim. I think they look great and they also look very nice to wear with jeans. I've only been wearing them for a week so I cannot rate longevity yet. I'll update the review if I experience any problems.",5,1,5.0
"The area under the tongue of the shoe rubbed against the top of my foot and was quite uncomfortable. Otherwise, I liked the larger toe box and it fit like a size 7. Unfortunately, I had to return the shoes due to the rubbing and pressure from part of the shoe.",2,0,5.0
"I’m going to keep the tennis shoes, though they still need a lot of work. They are extremely, extremely tight across the bridge underneath your toes. I even had three other people try them on and they both experienced the same thing. That said, they are very light, and the price point is good, so I’m going to just see if I can stretch them out.",3,0,5.0
"These arrived a day late. You can definitely tell one of my shoes was worn and “refurbished�?from this seller. The discoloration is faint but it’s there.
I do not recommend purchasing from this seller as the shoes were advertised as new.",2,0,5.0
"I ONLY buy Nike. My last two pairs of Nike sneakers lasted me almost seven years! I have to say these ones are the most comfortable ones I have EVER bought. I'm not a runner, but I use these for long walks, lots of hills and some grassy areas (almost like hiking) and for the gym. I have plantar fasciitis, and one ankle that is weak due to a nasty sprain a few months ago. These sneakers have EXCELLENT support! I usually have to buy custom inserts for my shoes because I have really deep arches (when they aren't supported the plantar fasciitis is unbearably painful) but I did not need to. My feet don't cramp up and they don't rub and give me blisters. Breathable fabric too!",5,1,5.0
"Great for casual wear but I wouldn’t recommend them for running or hard core exercise as they fit very snug if you have a wider foot. I am a size 9 1/2 in a running shoe so I ordered a 10 and they were still too small, and that’s without socks! Love the style and color, and I wear them for the purpose of running errands and yard work, but again, definitely not great for workouts.",3,0,5.0
"I had the 8 to this previously and I am walk up to 4 miles in it. This is no different. I wore them for the first time today on a 4 mile walk and they were light and flexible just like the 8. They fit as expected im a 9.5 and bought 9.5. However I do tend to wear thicker socks and the 8 was definitely a more of a snug fit than these. I don't like that the tongue is on the thicker end and is sewed to the base and not the sides, to get it flat after putting on takes a little finesse. However I do like that I can tighten around my ankles by tightening the lace due to the top lace looks are linked to the piece round the back of the shoe.",4,1,5.0
"The packaging these were shipped in was more substantial than the shoes. No arch support. No cushioning in the sole. Inferior materials used for the upper. Strap the box on your foot you'll get the same experience as wearing this shoe for your workout. I returned them. Nike used to stand for superior quality, Now you pay for a swoosh. Ended up going, of all things, Sketchers. I work out daily and wanted support for my feet. Their arch-support line nailed it, support I was looking for and sole cushion for miles!",1,0,5.0
"Running shoes can be very uncomfortable for people with tall arches or just tall feet in general. In my case, these shoes hurt the top of my right foot which has a taller arch than my left. I ended up lacing the shoes differently to accommodate for the extra space that I needed on top and then there was none of that uncomfortable pressure on the top of my foot. My only other problem was that the shoes are more narrow than I expected. Not uncomfortably narrow, just narrow enough that makes me think that the sides will wear quicker.",4,1,5.0
"I love these shoes. I got them to replace my current Nikes - which have endured years at the gym - and I couldn't be happier. They fit comfortably with the toe slightly wider than the heel.

My only dislike about the shoe is that the heel is higher than my last pair and rubs annoyingly against the back of my ankle. Hopefully this will go away after I've broken them in more (It's been 1 week).",5,1,5.0
Toe bos is a little wide but other than that the fit was true to size for me. These are casual shoes for a sporty outfit or low impact days at the gym. Might be ok for light walking on even terrain but nothing more. Quality is what I expected and they work great for my casual dress days or kids sporting events.,4,1,5.0
"When I pulled the shoes out of the box I thought: these are fake. Quality is not what I expect from Nike. Cheap, no support, runs small, low in heal and narrow at the toe. The black Nike insignia across the top (bought light gray w/ aqua) is bad design. Did not notice this in pics. Will wear to walk dog around the block.",3,0,5.0
"The eyelet that braces the shoelace from rubbing against the fabric of the shoe broke apart within at right about 2 months of wear, only indoors, never wet or damaged. If I continue wearing the shoe, the shoelace pulls on the fabric and will eventually tear the shoe itself. The one star rating isn't necessarily for the shoe, because this seems to be a defect & since I'm otherwise satisfied with them, but for Nike customer service and my lack of options on returning/exchanging the shoe. Would give zero stars if I could.",1,0,5.0
Needed a new shoe for training it’s light flexible with enough support to manage jump squats.,5,1,5.0
"I wear a size 10 with my other Nike running shoes, but these in the same size and they were like boats! looked terrible and had zero support. I assumed that it was the size, so I bought a size down. Just received it and they are so tight at the bottom of the tongue, my feet hurt simply by standing. I am returning both and am really disappointed....",1,0,5.0
I got stardust- phantom white -coral color. The shoes look cute but it is definitely not an original. The insides of the shoe feel like cheap foam material and the sole has no support at all. This can hurt the feet at the time of training. This is not an original because I have always worn nike and I have never seen a shoe with this kind of sole and material from this brand. Returning it immediately.,1,0,5.0
"The tongue on this shoe rolls and has to be readjusted through the day. I love the whole feel of the shoe minus the tongue. I bought these to dance in, the flex makes it easier, the flex shoe design makes it really easy for the shoe to capture small rocks.",4,1,5.0
"I bought it to workout at the gym. Was very disappointed on how the tongue fit. It appears that they forgot to include the tongue during the manufacture process and added it later.
I would have return it but I wore it to the gym.",3,0,5.0
"1 week after getting my shoes the stitching on the shoe started coming undone. The tongue of the shoe is way too big and bunches up inside the shoe when you tie it, which causes it to irritate the top of your foot. I only wear them more as a casual walking around shoe. They clearly are not a running or extended walking shoe, they would never hold up. Disappointed in This Nike product!!!!",1,0,5.0
"I have my doubts whether these are actually authentic Nike. A lot of glue around the soles, poor stitching, and the sizing is off. I own a good amount of nike running shoes and trainers and I wear a size 6.5 in all of them. These 6.5s are way too big. The arch support in these shoes is horrible. Almost like the arch support is flipped. No support on the inside and huge arch support on the outer part of the shoe. They are unwearable. Im going to go to an actual store and try them on from somewhere I know they are legit, but these seem like extremely low quality shoes.",1,0,5.0
Only used for 30 min a day 30 days and ripped! The return window closed not worth the purchase,1,0,5.0
"I feel like I'm one of the few who likes these and I don't normally like Nike sneakers...they were light, cute and rather comfy for the roughly 100k steps I took over a long weekend vacation and a couple of bootcamp classes. They served their purpose. I wouldn't wear these for long runs or anything overly intense impact - but jacks, jumps, lunges, skaters, etc. - felt study and comfy for me.",4,1,5.0
Comfortable and right size but how do I keep this tongue from popping up/forward. Not enough holes for proper lacing.,3,0,5.0
"I have never bought shoes on line before, let alone for my wife. She wanted these so I bought them. She loves them and now I am a hero. She had a knee replacement and needed the new shoes. She loves them and wears them everywhere.",5,1,5.0
"I’ve been wearing Nikes since high school, at work and for workouts. These are pretty good, comfortable, but the tongue on this shoe is big and doesn’t lay flat. The soles were also a little slick on the weight bench during my workout (hopefully will roughen up in time).",4,1,5.0
"Like style idea/look, but not so much on my feet. Might have given it a shot, but they were too small. Didn't seem to have much support. I usually like Nike, but had to return this pair.",3,0,5.0
"There is a bright blue strap along the heel that is solid and will not stretch so that I cannot put the shoe on. This strap is not mentioned in the description, it took me 3-4 minutes to get one shoe on, using a shoe horn. I returned them.",3,0,5.0
Yes! These are expensive! I was hesitant but I’m satisfied they fit as expected! I am 125 pounds I wear a 7 1/2 and it fits perfectly and they are very comfortable,5,1,5.0
"Great shoe great quality just not for wide chunky feet especially if your feet get puffy during workouts. The ties stopped at an awkward place on my feet so it always felt like my feet would slip out and if i tied it enough so it doesnt feel like that it was too uncomfortable to work out in. This is more of a run errands than a work out shoe, unless you have very slim narrow feet.",4,1,5.0

I normally wear a size 10 but these needed to be a 9.5 to fit right. They even look too big and make me feel like I have clown feet. If ur between sizes I'd size down. Also they are very light weight which is great but you can see the outline of toes. Not sure if thats just because the size wasnt right. Other than that they are a good light weight everyday shoe,4,1,5.0
